"1",37,"AFG",62,2007,"Over the 62 years of its existence  the General Assembly has witnessed many moments of historical reckoning. It was one such moment  five years ago  when Afghanistan returned to the Assembly as a country emerging out of a long  dark era of war  violence and terror. As I stood before the Assembly in September 2002  the challenges of restoring security to the lives of the Afghan people and of rebuilding Afghanistan into a stable and democratic country seemed all but insuperable. The fate of a nation swayed between the promise of a safer and more prosperous future  on the one hand  and the enormity of the tasks  on the other hand.  Today  efforts in support of stability and reconstruction in Afghanistan are proceeding resolutely apace. The Afghan people continue to make the best of the new opportunities. Our economy is surging ahead. The legitimacy of our newly founded institutions is gradually taking root. Our society is brimming with freedom and activity.  For too long  Afghanistan was in an unenviable position in terms of most human development indicators. That situation is no longer acceptable  and is changing rapidly. Today more Afghans enjoy access to health and education than ever before in our history. We have very fortunately cut our child mortality rate  which was one of the highest in the world just two years ago  by 25 per cent. As a result  over 85 000 more children have a chance to live today.  For the first time in 40 years  Afghanistan is set once again to become self-sufficient in food production. Already  the fruits of relative stability and increased prosperity in Afghanistan are spilling over the borders to the wider region. Having enjoyed unprecedented growth in our regional trade over the past six years  we are now moving to consolidate Afghanistan’s role in the economic integration of the region. Earlier this year  we assumed membership of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The significance of that step lies in the potential for Afghanistan to connect South Asia to Central Asia and the Middle East in commerce and interaction.   Last month  President Rahmon of Tajikistan and I were joined by the United States Secretary of Commerce to inaugurate a transit bridge financed by the United States that connects Afghanistan with Tajikistan and beyond. That bridge  alongside many other infrastructure projects we have completed  is to play a significant role in the further economic integration of the region.  Make no mistake: despite our achievements  a safer and brighter future for Afghanistan still hinges on many serious challenges. Poverty  underdevelopment  climatic hardships and  above all  the menaces of terrorism and narcotics  are challenges of global proportions that continue to be shared by Afghanistan as a member of the global village.  To the extent that terrorism remains a threat  world citizens will never be safe. Six years after Afghanistan’s liberation from the grip of international terrorists  we are still grappling with this threat on a daily basis. Terrorists continue to kill innocent people  including those who have come from the outside world to help. The past two years have witnessed a significant increase in terrorist attacks carried out with new and brutal tactics such as beheadings  kidnappings and the burning of schools and clinics.  Terrorism can only be overcome if it is addressed appropriately across its regional and international dimensions. We are monitoring with deep concern the continued presence of a terrorist infrastructure in our region  and condemn  in equally strong terms  the atrocities that terrorists are committing in places beyond our borders.   Recognizing that constructive regional cooperation is vital to a successful counterterrorism strategy  we proposed the holding of a joint jirga  or council  between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are pleased with the support that that initiative has received from our friends in the international community. The first joint peace council between Afghanistan and Pakistan was held in Kabul last month. It was a promising step in harnessing the unequivocal support of civil societies in both countries in our common fight against terrorism and extremism. We expect that the outcome of the council will translate into concrete action.  While we continue our struggle against terrorism  we will also focus on reconciliation with those that are not part of Al Qaida and other terrorist networks.   I also note  with deep concern  the particularly heinous use by terrorists of local populations as human shields  resulting in the loss of civilian lives. While condemning such deliberate targeting of civilians in the strongest possible terms  I would like to emphasize the need for maximum caution on the part of the international forces operating in Afghanistan  as well as for increased coordination with Afghan authorities  in order to avoid civilian casualties.  Narcotics is another global peril that  like terrorism  seriously undermines the stability and well-being of our societies. In Afghanistan  that scourge is the legacy of the decades of misfortunes that befell our country — from the widespread despair induced by war and oppression  to drought and climatic hardships. We are working with our international partners to tackle the menace. We will prioritize the provision of alternative livelihoods to farmers and expedite implementation of other strategies  including poppy eradication and the interdiction of traffickers. However  addressing the world’s drug challenge must involve focus on the far greater dimensions of the drug trade that lie outside Afghanistan  such as fighting the international drug mafia  ensuring stricter border control  and reducing demand in foreign markets.  Climate change has rightly been recognized as a serious challenge facing the entire world. No country  developed or developing  is immune to its impact. Yesterday’s high-level event on that important topic was an essential step forward in strengthening the resolve of the international community to address that global threat with unity. We fully support the recommendations of the Chairman’s summary.  We are also watching the situation in the Middle East with deep concern. In particular  we remain concerned about the situation in Palestine and call for the full realization of the rights of our Palestinian brothers and sisters  including their right to an independent State  living side by side with its neighbours in peace and coexistence.   The adoption of the Iraq Compact  sponsored by the United Nations and the international community  was an achievement marking Iraq’s new partnership with the international community to consolidate peace and promote social and economic development. We  the Afghan people  wish our brothers and sisters in Iraq every success in achieving their aspiration of a peaceful and prosperous Iraq.  Allow me to thank our partners in the international community  the United States  Japan  members of NATO  the European Union  our brothers in the Islamic world  our neighbours  China  India  Australia and all other countries for supporting Afghanistan during these years of challenge to our country. We appreciate the role that the United Nations and the Secretary-General are playing in coordinating the international community’s role in the development process in Afghanistan. I am particularly thankful to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his initiative  two days ago  of calling a high-level international meeting on Afghanistan  at which our partners once again reaffirmed their commitment to Afghanistan’s rebuilding and reconstruction.  Six years ago  in an unprecedented convergence of interests  the international community united behind Afghanistan  facing up to the inescapable reality that the world’s security had come to depend on stability and progress in Afghanistan. Today  many of the nations represented here can rightly take pride in what we have achieved together. I thank them all for their commitment and for the steadfast support they have provided to Afghanistan over the past six years. Without that support  the progress we have made in Afghanistan would be simply unthinkable."
"2",76,"AGO",62,2007,"At the outset  I would like to salute the international community  legitimately represented here today. I would also like to take this opportunity to personally congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his election to the post of Secretary-General of our Organization. I am confident  Sir  that your able leadership  steadfastness and commitment will assist us in our search for consensual solutions to the issues that affect humanity in order to make the world an increasingly safer  freer and fairer place.  Today  the world is confronted with global warming  a consequence of the atmospheric pollution resulting from human activity on Earth  which is causing dramatic and dangerous climate change. The world is also confronted with extremists who resort to terrorism and the use of religion for political ends; with growing militarism as a would-be response to terrorism; and with the hoarding of capital  information and know-how  all of which widen the gap between the rich and the poor and generate social tensions around the world.  On the issue of terrorism  the model of an open  democratic and tolerant civilization  with a State that serves the interests of all  has shown that parties that alternate in political office in the post-cold-war period can coexist and fight for their principles and values through peaceful means. I believe that the same model can be successful if properly adjusted to the concrete realities of other regions.  At the same time  we must continue to deepen our study and analysis of the threat of terrorism and use peaceful means to seek an ever-broader consensus on the collective responses needed to counter it.   Islam can peacefully coexist in societies with other religious beliefs. However  it is necessary to neutralize fanaticism and prevent the Islamization of the State  which is contrary to humanity’s modern legal concept of a secular State.  In our opinion  it is necessary to defend cultural diversity and to render more inclusive and fair the process of political  economic and social development; to support and stimulate  in countries that are predominantly Islamic  all the forces and movements that defend modern life and the separation of State from religion; and to support the values and privileges of the universal culture that are enshrined in conventions  charters and international treaties. This movement is immense  it continues to grow and it can be more effective than military action  which in our understanding should only constitute a last resort.   Ecumenism and dialogue among cultures are other avenues for action that can be better and more frequently used to bring together the dominant religions and all the people of the world  based on the ideals of peace  solidarity and fraternity.  The fight against poverty and hunger in the world  with a global plan monitored by the United Nations as an international convention  higher and fairer remuneration for commodities or natural resources extracted from developing countries and technical support to poor States would contribute greatly to eliminating social inequalities and the social seedbed and support of those who prefer violence.  In this regard  the globalization of the economy must be regulated in order to mitigate the asymmetries between the centre and the periphery of the economic system and to ensure that each person has the necessary means for survival with dignity.  Such regulation should further address environmental matters. There are countries that have experienced rapid industrial development without paying due attention to the protection of the environment. Other countries are now involved in an identical endeavour  thus increasing the production of carbon dioxide and worsening the greenhouse effect. It is plain that a new meeting of all world leaders is urgently required in order to approve and begin the execution of a global plan of environmental protection.  We therefore support the initiative of the Secretary-General to that end  convinced that the countries that most pollute the atmosphere  such as the richest countries  should contribute more resources to its protection.  Today  the Republic of Angola is in a position to engage more actively in this collective effort of solidarity for humanity  because the country has been at peace for a little more than five years and is moving towards complete normalization of its political  economic and social life. Proof of that lies in the fact that Angola has already signed all the international protocols in favour of environmental protection  such as the Kyoto and the Montreal Protocols  while contributing to conflict resolution and peace in its region and in the African continent as a whole.  As a country that has recently chaired the Peacebuilding Commission  we are pleased to learn of the important progress achieved in consolidating the peace processes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Burundi  Côte d’Ivoire  Liberia and Serra Leone.  However  the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the conflict in Darfur  Sudan  still prevail  while the issue of Western Sahara’s self-determination remains unresolved. I am convinced that the Organization will remain engaged in the search for a solution to these problems in the shortest time possible and that United Nations forces will be urgently deployed in Darfur.  The Commission of the Gulf of Guinea is currently headquartered in Luanda  where the representatives of the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic met recently at the initiative of Angola. Both institutions promote peace  security  stability and multiform cooperation among their members  in consonance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.  I must highlight the decisive role that regional and subregional organizations can play in the prevention and resolution of conflicts. At the same time  they can alert everyone to the need to strengthen the mandates and the financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations  without prejudice to post-conflict activities  such as disarmament and the resettlement of populations  among other actions.  In the particular case of Africa  it is in our interest to see the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) fully achieved  so that the growth rate of the entire continent can be aligned with that of the world economy. The reduction of extreme poverty by 50 per cent by 2015  as foreseen by the United Nations  must be accompanied by a decisive fight against hunger and disease  including HIV/AIDS and other endemic scourges. The effectiveness of these actions depends  however  on complementary achievements  such as fairer trade with developed countries  greater fluidity in the transfer of capital  official development assistance and forgiveness of foreign debt.  In recent years  significant progress has been made in the reform of the United Nations system. It is nevertheless important to continue to move forward in that process  especially in regard to the Security Council  with the objective of strengthening the authority and the effectiveness of the Organization and making it more representative  more democratic and more participatory in the areas of international security  development and human rights.  In spite of criticism and some known failures  the United Nations remains the only institution at the international level with the prestige and credibility to resolve inter-State conflicts and crises that  due to their dimensions  escape the control of the authorities of a State or endanger its population.  The United Nations-led fight against conventional  nuclear  chemical and biological weapons and landmines  in addition to the peacekeeping and humanitarian operations of the Blue Helmets in many regions  have contributed to greater world security. In that regard  it is important to strengthen the monitoring of the implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  so as to move towards a global disarmament process and discourage a new arms race. It is also urgent to relaunch the Middle East peace process in a committed and comprehensive manner  for the Middle East remains unstable and the source of a constant threat to world peace.  A recurring theme in the Assembly’s agenda is the embargo against Cuba. It is imperative to put an end once and for all to the economic  trade and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America  as it violates the principles of international law and Chapters I and II of the United Nations Charter. Angola hopes that the United Nations will state its view on this matter and remain faithful to the core of its Charter  according to which all actions must be the result of a debate and a collective decision  thus excluding unilateralism.  The challenges that lie ahead of us entail a constructive dialogue among all the countries involved  especially among heads of State and Government  who will have to overcome possible differences and impediments and will have to find middle ground between the possible and the desirable  between boldness and realism.  We believe that through joint action  the promotion of dialogue among civilizations and the revitalization of the spirit of international solidarity  it will be possible to build a better world for all. A world of peace  based on justice and the rule of law  without weapons of war and without dangerous pollution is a safer world. Its construction depends entirely on the political will of all States Members of the United Nations  especially the permanent members of the Security Council. Let us all unite our forces for a better world for all."
"3",123,"ALB",62,2007,"Please allow me  Sir  to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session and to wish you great success in that very important job. I would also like to thank the outgoing President  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her valuable contribution to the General Assembly. I also wish to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his leadership  his great efforts in support of peace and cooperation in the world and his contribution to strengthening the United Nations and its institutions.  As a representative of a country that suffered one of the most totalitarian of post-Second World War dictatorships  it is my deep conviction that defending and promoting freedom and its values and supporting oppressed peoples in order that they may free themselves from tyrannical regimes that continue to produce human suffering  poverty  violence and terrorism should be the main priority of the Organization. In that context  I would like to say that Central Asia  the Middle East  the Balkans and the entire world are now freer and safer without the likes of Mullah Omar  Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the message of hope that President George W. Bush and other leaders have sent from this rostrum to all the peoples of the world still living under tyrannical regimes.  Albania is a small country  but one with a clear vocation and determination to strengthen freedom and democracy for its citizens. Albania is also deeply committed to making its modest contribution to peace and security in the world. We have established close cooperation with friendly countries and international organizations in the fight against terrorism. In that regard  our peacekeeping units have served or are serving in Bosnia  Georgia  Afghanistan and Iraq. I am delighted to inform the Assembly that  in that same spirit  my Government has decided to contribute another platoon to United Nations peacekeeping operations.  Albania has also been a staunch supporter of international efforts to limit the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the unlawful use of small arms and light weapons  which pose a serious threat to peace  security and stability. In that context  among other measures  we committed ourselves to the full destruction of our stockpile of chemical weapons. In July 2007  Albania became the first country in the world free of chemical materials and armaments of any kind. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Governments of the United States  Germany  Italy  Greece and Switzerland  which provided valuable financial and technical assistance to achieve that important objective.  We are successfully implementing a number of very important programmes in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  UNICEF and many other United Nations agencies. Albania became part of the effort to reform the United Nations by voluntarily joining the One United Nations programme as a pilot country. We are currently working with United Nations agencies in order to test the One United Nations concept and to develop new approaches and models for partnership in the areas of development  humanitarian assistance and the environment. The first results of the project are truly very encouraging. We are fully committed to making every effort in order to ensure that the initiative can become a success story.  European integration and membership in NATO are two main objectives for Albania. We are committed to undertake any reform and take any step to achieve those goals. A year ago  we signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the European Union (EU). We are working seriously in every way to fulfil its standards and obligations. At the same time  we have undertaken thorough reforms of our armed forces  with the assistance of many NATO member countries. We are also working to strengthen the rule of law and democracy in our country. We are hopeful that by the time of the next NATO summit  in Bucharest  we will be in a position to deserve an invitation to join the alliance.  It was not long ago that the Balkans was the stage for human tragedies  brutal wars and ethnic cleansing based on the concept of a “greater country” and fuelled by the extreme nationalism and racism of a nation that was consumed by the idea of its own hegemony over others. But in a few years  the Balkan countries have managed to transit from the age of dictatorships  hatred and conflicts into an age of peace  cooperation  friendship and integration.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the Governments and taxpayers of the countries members of NATO  the EU and the United Nations  as well as the other organizations whose support and assistance was so important in bringing about that historic change. However  I believe that a final solution to the issue of Kosova’s status that fully respects the expressed will of its citizens for independence is a fundamental precondition for durable peace and stability  not only in Kosova but in the entire region as well. Albania fully supported President Ahtisaari’s project and the efforts of the Troika for the solution for the final status.  Due to the lack of realism and the ghost of a greater Serbia  Belgrade turned down President Ahtisaari’s project  which sets forth and guarantees the highest  by far  European standards for the Serb minorities in Kosova  standards that  in truth  are much more advanced than those enjoyed by the Albanians living in southern Serbia.  Rejection of the Ahtisaari package is unhelpful and proves that what matters first for Belgrade is not the freedom and rights of Serbs in Kosova  but rather the idea of a greater Serbia. Such a stance by Belgrade has been encouraged by the Russian position in the Security Council with regard to Ahtisaari’s project  a position that  despite its motivation  does not contribute to peace and stability in the region.  Claims that Kosova’s independence sets an international precedent or lays conditions for the creation of a greater Albania  as well as the fear of two Albanian states in the Balkans  are unfounded. Those who are interested in the truth and in reality can easily realize that Kosova is a unique case  from both the historical and current perspectives.  For more than five centuries  from the end of the thirteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth  Kosova was a part of the Ottoman Empire  inhabited mainly by native Albanians whose roots and shelter had been there since the very beginning. Only at the start of the last century  in one of the greatest historic injustices  Kosova was separated from the Albanian territory and given in tribute to Serbia — for the sole reason that it was part of an empire that lost the war.  Kosova is also a unique case in her sufferings. During the past century  the implementation of the Cubrilovic doctrine of extreme racism and extermination against Albanians turned them into third-class citizens and turned Kosova into an arena of ethnic cleansing and real apartheid.  It is also a unique case because the last Serbian genocide against Albanians  in 1999  which caused thousands of atrocities among innocent populations  multiple massive graves and the destruction and burning of more than 130 thousand homes  schools and hospitals  obliged the North Atlantic alliance to undertake its greatest offensive to protect human rights and freedom there.  Kosova is also a unique case from a legal standpoint  because during Josip Broz Tito’s regime it was a constitutional entity of the Yugoslav federation  enjoying its veto rights in the federal Government. During this time  Kosova chaired the Yugoslav federation for several terms  based on the leadership rotation principle within Yugoslavia.  The claim that the independence of Kosova could lead to the creation of a greater Albania cannot be farther from the truth. In reality  Kosova’s independence will only end the fluidity of Albanians in the Balkans  along with the idea of the creation of a single Albanian State in the territories where they are a dominant majority. The simple truth is that Kosova Albanians have decided in their great project for the future to join Brussels and not to join Tirana.  On the other hand  I would like to guarantee that Albania remains determined to fully respect the international borders of its neighbours  including those of Kosova. Albania is closely collaborating and will continue to cooperate bilaterally with all countries in the region  including Serbia  in the process of regional  European and Euro-Atlantic integration. I believe that the concern about two independent Albanian States in the Balkans is xenophobic. Two democratic States with an Albanian majority will be two more countries friendly to their neighbours.  I would like to urge the political leadership of Kosova to refrain from taking unilateral actions. They should continue  as they have done so far  to cooperate with the Contact Group and the international community in seeking a solution for the final status of Kosova  with full respect for its will and the dignity it deserves.  I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the political leadership of Kosova for submitting a treaty of reconciliation  friendship and cooperation with Serbia — a treaty inspired by the highest European values and the best of European heritage. I hope and wish that Serbia would take up this important opportunity  because I believe that peace and coexistence between Albanians and Serbs in the Balkans will best benefit both of these nations."
"4",146,"AND",62,2007,"People and planet. They are our alpha and our omega. They are the foundation and objective of actions by bodies such as the United Nations.  The Earth is blue like an orange  said the poet Paul Eluard. That is a logical statement  as our planet takes its blue colour from the sky and the oceans that protect us  and the orange colour from the fruit that nourishes us. The Earth is a sphere that moves and turns with infinite interdependence. The human attitude  nature and peoples are bound together to form a single scheme of debate  impossible to resolve separately.  Every year in the General Assembly we are pleased to feel that our work is centred on the ideals of a better world in the environment of a democratic structure  dialogue  the brotherhood of cultures and financial and social interchange  supportive and prosperous between peoples.  The latest data available to us on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) show a positive trend. We have made great progress in the reduction of child mortality and we have applied various measures of truly surprising simplicity that have demonstrated their effectiveness in eradicating many illnesses. And yet the inhabitants of the world — the people  flora and fauna of the planet — look at our organizations and all of us somewhat suspiciously. There is much concern. There is great uncertainty.  With your permission  my words today will not be of self-complacency either for the results obtained or for the undeniable improvement in some of the ailments that undermine our dignity as people. Congratulations can give way to relaxation and can have a perversely soothing effect on our consciences. The development of global societies has become essential in the light of the positions affecting economic  social  cultural  military and political systems on a worldwide scale. There is an urgent need for conceptualization in the face of the evident poverty resulting from the sudden and profound transformations suffered by peoples  regions and countries. Successive waves of contributions of capital and human resources combine with pre-existing human substrata  creating superimposed layers that further accentuate differences. When those investments cease to be profitable  resources are redirected. That results in situations of change or crisis.  The realities on which we have to concentrate are those of a world in which  according to the latest data published by UNICEF  9.7 million children’s lives were lost in one year; a world in which human life expectancy can differ by more than 30 years; a world in which more than 39 million people are infected with the AIDS virus; and a world in which too many people are still without access to safe drinking water. That is not doomsaying on my part; it is a recognition that the advances made cannot conceal the profound shortcomings that still exist or hold back the achievement of results.  Indignation and rejection in the face of every unacceptable reality have made possible the finest achievements for the progress of humanity in a remarkable way at the United Nations and must now enable us to obtain more resources  to go faster  to have more ideas and to be even more effective.  Mr. Beck (Palau)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  For more than six decades  the United Nations has sought to be the moral and legal force which ensures that dialogue  cooperation and solidarity take the place of oppression  weapons  famine  ignorance  misery and injustice. However  during the years of existence of the United Nations  wars  poverty and intolerance have not stopped. On the contrary  we have had to add new ills  such as the radicalization of fundamentalism or the degradation of the environment  and increasingly frequent natural disasters. Earthquakes  hurricanes  typhoons  cyclones  tornadoes and floods and the thawing of many of the glaciers at the two poles are vivid examples of the climatic disorder that we have to combat. To tell the truth  the planet is threatened; but I do not think that this is an accurate assertion. Those really threatened are the most vulnerable persons and countries. They are the ones who suffer from war  illness and underdevelopment. Climate change will affect all of us  but not all of us equally.  At the same time  trafficking in  and the abuse of  children and women continue despite the legal instruments with which we have equipped countries such as Andorra  where the defence of human rights and liberties is considered to be a fundamental inspiring principle.  The world of the twenty-first century views armed conflicts  terrorism  violations of human rights and extremely precarious situations in many areas with something between resignation and impotence. I would refer  merely as an example  to the extreme situation that has affected the population of Darfur for many years.   We should not be surprised that  faced with all those hard realities  international institutions like ours are suffering serious crises of discredit and significant erosion. Nevertheless  if we are here today it is because we believe that we can improve the world — people and planet — because we are convinced that together we are able to react. Hope remains intact. Every country — whatever its size — and every director and every organization with the capacity for action has to fight to make law into the essence of vitality and to achieve open and sincere dialogue in the international arena. As Charles de Gaulle said  it takes several to deliberate  and one to act. As Al Gore told us on Monday  the world requires a global Marshall Plan  because our planet is in an emergency situation.  We are delighted with the thrust and  dynamism displayed by the new Secretary-General   Mr. Ban Ki-moon  since he took office. We praise the efforts of the General Assembly in setting up a Working Group on Security Council reform  as well as the proposals that are being studied. We fully support the model of society proposed by the United Nations — rooted in the principles of peace  solidarity  liberty  cooperation  social development and economic growth.  With regard to goals  I applaud the initiative of the Millennium Development Goals. At the time of their introduction  the previous Secretary-General warned us that we needed to break with routine. He told us that we could not achieve results in a day because success would require sustained action over the 10 years envisaged for implementation. Today  before the entire Assembly  I add my full support to those words. I call upon everyone to maintain the pace and to press the foot down a little harder on the accelerator.  We all benefit from the progress that we have made. We know the enduring relationship that exists between poverty and nearly all the challenges we face: mortality rates  differences in life expectancy  ill health  injustice  intolerance  marginalization and armed conflict. Let us reject before the world and before all peoples some of the pernicious prejudices that prevent us from advancing. Permit me to recall three truths that have been defined a number of times by Jeffrey Sachs  the director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.  The first is that the illnesses ravaging poor countries are perfectly avoidable and can be prevented. The second is that to avoid all the thoroughly unnecessary deaths caused by them will not affect the population explosion. The third is that poor countries  as has already been shown and in refutation of some voices deliberately ignorant of their prejudices  are capable of installing efficient public health programmes when they receive adequate aid.  As a result of the terror and the material and moral misery suffered during the Second World War  countries  peoples and their representatives came to an agreement  saying “enough” and creating organizations such as the United Nations to regulate and mediate conflict. They did this with a sense of generosity  a breadth of purpose and a boldness that today must inspire our action even more.  The ideals of the fathers of the Charter of the United Nations were founded on a respect for individuals  on liberty and on access to knowledge and education to achieve welfare and peace around the world. Only through an energetic renewal of those ideals can we ensure that the balance on planet Earth improves perceptibly and continues to do so year by year. Only with the unity  understanding and cooperation of all nations can we obtain results.  The small size of Andorra has not prevented us from maintaining good neighbourly relationships with France and Spain for more than seven centuries. We are fully concerned and involved with the objectives of the United Nations. With our long and  at the same time  humble experience  we could even become a neutral area  impartial and isolated from partisan interests  in the case of any conflict in need of resolution.  We must be realistic  but this must not stop us. We must advance with modest but continuous reforms  tangible and firm reforms that lead us to a better future. "
"5",191,"ARE",62,2007,"It gives me great pleasure to express  on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates  our sincere congratulations to you  Sir  and to your friendly country on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We look forward to working closely with you as you seek to successfully discharge your mission.  I would also like to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her remarkable achievements during her presidency at the sixty-first session of the General Assembly  in particular her efforts to stimulate more active debate among cultures.  I also take this opportunity to express our warmest greetings to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  the Secretary-General  and to note our appreciation of the initiatives he has taken to promote the role of the United Nations since assuming his post.  Our world still suffers from a wide range of regional and international issues  conflicts and threats  most visible among which are the worldwide spread of poverty and epidemics  the degradation of the environment  terrorism  organized crime  the spread of extremism and violations of human rights  and attempts to obtain nuclear weapons. This should prompt us to make sincere and determined efforts to implement the recommendations  decisions and plans of action approved by the world’s leaders and by the United Nations.  Given its interest in and commitment to the principle of good-neighbourly relations  as well as its respect for the national sovereignty of other States  the United Arab Emirates would like to draw attention to the fact that  thus far  no progress whatsoever has been made on the issue of the Iranian occupation since 1971 of three islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates: the Greater Tunb  the Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. This is despite the consistent efforts expended and the positive peaceful initiatives taken by my country  which wants this issue settled by peaceful means  either through bilateral and unconditioned negotiations or by referral of the issue to the International Court of Justice for legal arbitration.  Severe conflict has sorely wounded our region  and quick and effective treatment is required. As for Iraq  we express our firm belief that all should abstain from interference in Iraq’s internal affairs and should show respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. This requires that all parties should cooperate to bring to an end the cycle of violence and the inflaming of passions  and it calls for partition and division. Let us give our support to an Iraqi Government that truly works to achieve national reconciliation. The United Arab Emirates renews its encouragement for the efforts made to promote reconstruction in Iraq.  Regarding the Middle East crisis  we call on the United Nations  and the Security Council in particular  to play a more active role  together with the Middle East Quartet  to give new momentum to the Middle East peace process. We stress that no solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is possible without Israel’s acceptance of the Arab Peace Initiative  which is based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and offers a balanced and comprehensive solution to this long-standing conflict.  In this context  we are following with interest the efforts to convene the international peace conference for the Middle East later this year with the participation of all concerned parties. We look forward to a balanced and fair settlement of the issue on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative  the United Nations Security Council resolutions  and the rules of international legitimacy. We also renew our support for Syria’s right to regain its full sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights.  We note with satisfaction the United Nations role in restoring security and stability in Lebanon  thanks to the pressure put on Israel to fulfil its legal obligations under Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  including respect for Lebanon’s sovereignty  withdrawal from the Shaba’a farmlands and the village of al-Ghajar and the handing over of detailed maps and coordinates of the landmines that Israel planted in southern Lebanon.  We reaffirm our support for the reconstruction efforts and for the stability and territorial integrity of Lebanon as well as for the maintenance of its constitutional institutions. In this respect  the United Arab Emirates has undertaken a number of reconstruction projects in Lebanon and has provided humanitarian assistance. The United Arab Emirates collaborates closely with the Lebanese Government and the United Nations to remove mines and unexploded ordnance  this work having originally commenced as part of an initiative taken by the United Arab Emirates in 2001  when my Government provided initial funding of $50 million.  We hope that talks between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency will eventually lead to a permanent  peaceful solution that will spare the region further tensions and conflicts and will help to reassure countries in the region that they will not be faced with any threats to their security. We stress again that Israel should not be excluded from the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  The United Arab Emirates continues to cooperate fully with all efforts to combat all forms of terrorism  including associated money-laundering. We also emphasize the importance of promoting dialogue among cultures and civilizations and of enhancing tolerance among religions.  The United Arab Emirates contributes generously to the financing of development projects in some 95 States. Such assistance has exceeded $70 billion and is intended to promote a culture of peace and stability in those countries and throughout the world. Consistent with that approach  the United Arab Emirates has created a number of institutions  including the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development  the Zayed Charitable and Humanitarian Foundation  the Khalifa bin Zayed Foundation for Charitable Work and the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Charity  which recently launched the “Dubai Cares” charity campaign  which seeks to guarantee education for 1 million children around the world  especially in Asia and Africa.  Since its creation in 1971  the United Arab Emirates has achieved economic  social and cultural progress that has helped to establish stability and well-being for citizens of the Emirates and job opportunities for the millions who work in our country.  We have also launched an interim political reform plan  in whose first phase half of the members of the Federal National Council were elected as an important step towards political participation. In this context  I should also like to make reference to the significant national gains that have been made by women in the United Arab Emirates. Two women sit in the Council of Ministers  and women hold approximately a quarter of the seats in the Federal National Council. They are also represented in the judiciary and in other senior leadership and decision-making positions.  In the context of its national  regional and international efforts and cooperation  the United Arab Emirates has enacted laws to counter terrorist crimes and money-laundering and has frozen many suspect bank and corporate accounts. It has also enacted laws on issues such as human trafficking and international judicial cooperation on criminal matters  and has adopted import and export control procedures for a range of commodities. In its desire for educational and cultural contact with the rest of the world  the United Arab Emirates has launched a number of initiatives  including the $2-million Sheikh Zayed Book Award  designed to motivate creative writers and intellectuals to make contributions in all spheres of the humanities.  As part of our efforts to bring the experience of the world’s most prestigious universities to the United Arab Emirates  we have recently launched the Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi and have inaugurated the Emirates Foundation to raise our educational  technological  intellectual and research resources to the highest global levels. Further underlining our belief in the importance of cultural communication among the world’s peoples for the preservation of the historical heritage of human civilization  we have agreed to build two world-class satellite museums in the United Arab Emirates: the Louvre Abu Dhabi and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi.  The United Arab Emirates prides itself on being home for people of all religions  ethnicities  cultures and countries from all continents. Indeed  the number of countries represented in the Emirates exceeds the total membership of the United Nations. All these people live in the Emirates in harmony  forming a model for what the modern world should be like.  In compliance with its obligations under international human rights and labour treaties  the United Arab Emirates has enacted legislation to guarantee the full rights of its expatriate workforce in accordance with relevant national and international laws and treaties. I affirm here that the relevant authorities in the United Arab Emirates are determined that these laws and treaties should be fully implemented so as to protect workers and provide them with the best working and living conditions.  Finally  we hope that our deliberations on the urgent international issues on the agenda of the current sixty-second session of the General Assembly will continue in a spirit of solidarity and will lead to positive steps towards the eventual fulfilment of our aspiration to peace  development and prosperity for our world and its peoples.

"6",238,"ARG",62,2007,"Allow me at the outset to express my sincerest congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. Argentina welcomes the new Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and expresses its support for his efforts at the head of the United Nations.   As in previous years  we have come to the General Assembly with the aim of revitalizing this world body and with the firm belief that this will ensure the effectiveness of international law in settling disputes  thus successfully dealing with any threats to peace.   The world is facing problems. The only hope we have of resolving them lies in respect for multilateralism  support for local customs  observance of international norms and conventions by all countries  and  of course  the full realization of human rights.  For each individual country  and for the world as a whole  peace will be possible only if we promote equality and work to combat poverty and marginalization. The world cannot and must not be a place where violations of human rights are everywhere. Peaceful coexistence is strengthened and maintained through true solidarity between nations based upon a concept of humanity that goes beyond the purely military or the predominantly unilateral.  Our international policy is based on the values of representative democracy  sovereignty of the people  respect for fundamental human rights  and the active upholding of international peace and security. Those principles are shared by the vast majority of the Argentine people. They help to focus the Government’s activities and are reflected in the decisions taken by the Argentine Republic at the international level.   We firmly support the construction of more just and equitable societies that distribute more equitably the benefits of economic growth. We know that each country must have the right to seek out its own development model  without external pressure.  The past few years have been very testing for us. Considerable efforts have been made to rescue a nation that barely five years ago was in the throes of an unprecedented social and economic crisis. At the time  many people thought that recovery might be impossible. But day by day  with a great deal of effort and humility  we revived production in a country burdened by a foreign debt that threatened our future with its conditions and constraints.  Argentina — a developing country which once demonstrated that it is truly possible to climb the social ladder; a country of immigrants where workers once succeeded in sending their children to university; a country once without illiteracy and having almost banished child mortality — had been reduced to a country of workers demoralized by unemployment  children begging in the streets instead of going to school  and the elderly living off miniscule pensions and becoming dependent on their children and grandchildren.  Our country’s coffers had been emptied owing to the rigid application of the rules of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As a corollary  there was violence in the streets  and Argentina experienced an institutional crisis  with presidents lasting only days. For the first time  Argentina sent off its own children into an unprecedented economic exile.   Today the Argentine State has won its autonomy and itself administers the variables of its macroeconomy as best it can in the current international environment. It pursues a sound  disciplined and predictable economic policy within a stable and democratic framework.   Our capacity for revitalization has allowed us  even without receiving funding  to begin cancelling our net debt with international organizations. We have even paid off in advance all of our debt with the IMF — an IMF that supported and promoted Governments that were self-supporting  adjusting and patching up their budgets  but at the cost of increasing the poverty of their people  promoting deindustrialization and irresponsibly plunging the country into debt.   Faced with the incredulous criticism of the promoters of orthodox prescriptions  Argentina  thanks to cautious monetary policies  disciplined public expenditures and a healthy budget surplus that enabled it to face or mitigate potential foreign crises  has reduced the debt and registered an annual growth rate of 9 per cent during the past five years. This was the strongest uninterrupted economic expansion of any in the past 100 years.   Today we represent the empirical proof that there is life after the Fund and also the certitude that other paths can lead to development and integration. We serve as a reminder of the unreliability of models that claim to be universally valid and the revindication of the right of countries to choose their own path  benefiting from international experience while prioritizing their national interests and circumstances above any other interest. Our case provides proof that the international economic architecture must be reformed  in particular that of IMF. The Fund is an exponent of an old world order that is no longer valid. Our case demonstrates the need for change in the multilateral financial institutions so that they can cooperate in the development of the less-well-endowed nations and help to fight poverty and generate true options for progress.  We are thinking  not of economic growth as defined by economic experts or historians  but of growth that has a strong social component and an emphasis on equity  where citizens are the focus of the results. Whereas one fourth of the labour force experienced the humiliation of being unemployed  unemployment has been reduced to 7.8 per cent since we have taken office. We are speaking  not about just any sort of work  but about appropriate and decent work of the kind we advocated at the most recent summit meeting of the Americas  which was held in our country.   Thanks to a productive policy that generates added value and  in addition  appeals to private enterprises to show social responsibility  we are reindustrializing Argentina. The economic indicators posted by our country today would have been impossible were it not for the complementarity of action between the State and the private sector.  Our sales to all destinations have doubled over the past four years  with a 16 per cent annual growth rate. Investments have improved substantially: gross domestic fixed investment has increased for the past 17 consecutive quarters; the ratio of investment to GDP is between 20 and 23 per cent — in stark contrast to the level of 2002 when it was hardly more than 11 per cent.   When faced with that crisis almost five years ago  we felt compelled to maintain essential assistance policies for the most vulnerable segments of our population. We do not regret those policies  and today we can state that the true solution to the serious social problems affecting our country  and many others around the world  lies in providing jobs  health care and education.   In the area of health  Argentina has launched a national policy that includes prescriptions for generic drugs and the provision of essential medications free of charge. It also strengthens maternity and child programmes and everything that relates to primary health care  in line with the goals of equity and protection. This has enabled us to compensate in part for the disastrous state of the public health sector a short time ago.   Of course  education is an essential element for renewing the social and moral fabric of the nation  even though the time horizon for its effects to be felt is longer than those of other public policies. In order to remedy the tragic situation that signalled the breakdown of society and the failure on the part of the State to protect those who were most vulnerable  a new law on national education was passed. It will again focus on ensuring equality of opportunity through guaranteed access to a quality education throughout the territory that is linked to the labour market and includes excellent training for teachers. Under the new law  a deadline of 2010 has been set  by which time 6 per cent of the gross national product will be used to finance education.  In this context of steady recovery  Argentina’s foreign policy is being strengthened and expanded  with a clear and decisive commitment to the national interest. Regional integration is a priority. Over the past two decades  through the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR)  Argentina has strengthened its commercial ties with the countries of the region. But its trade relations go far beyond the region. In that sense  multilateral negotiations within the World Trade Organization are of particular importance because the liberalization of our agricultural sector — in which our country has clear competitive advantages — depends on them  as does the adequate flexibility we need to carry out our industrial policies.   More equitable and fairer rules in international trade are of great importance to Argentina. We therefore participate actively in multilateral economic negotiations with the firm goal of achieving equity in the norms that govern world trade and of reversing the discrimination erected against our main products through tariff barriers and other trade-distorting instruments imposed by the developed countries.  Argentina will be present in all multilateral forums  where we will participate to ensure more equitable and democratic rules. Multilateralism is the most effective instrument for winning the battle against hunger  poverty  exclusion and environmental degradation.   Everything I have said here is both cause and consequence of institutional stability and respect for the rule of law. The three pillars of the Argentine State are making decisions to combat impunity and preserve memory  truth  and justice. We have begun bringing to justice those guilty of serious human rights violators. Those who imagined themselves having escaped with impunity are fiercely resisting justice and  in an attempt to intimidate witnesses  have caused the disappearance of one witness  Julio Lopez. They have thereby sent a dark message to a society that is seeking the truth about the crimes against humanity which they committed  and that condemns such acts.  Unconditional respect for human rights is our new national paradigm. In the past  we were known throughout the world for violations of those rights; today  as we strive to find the truth and to punish the guilty  we also seek to defend those rights worldwide.   Argentina  the Mothers and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo in the monumental dignity of their struggle  and the Argentine people have personally suffered under the inefficiency of a broken multilateral human rights system. Their sole comfort were the very precious humanitarian gestures of individuals  organizations and countries. While people were being kidnapped  tortured and killed in my country  the mechanisms established precisely to condemn and prevent such horrors remained silent. It is in their memory  so that this will never happen again  that we support the new Human Rights Council and hope that it will live up to the expectations of the international community.  My Government has endorsed instruments of great importance  including the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance  adopted by this Assembly on 20 December 2006  which we signed in Paris on 6 February. That instrument  along with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women  gives continuity and concrete form to a policy that ascribes a central role to the promotion of human rights.   In our public policy  we now focus on environmental protection  but we know that there will be no viable solution without cooperation among all the countries of the world  the industrialized countries in particular  because the nature of the problem is of a global scale.   The issue of climate change should be of concern to all Governments  because no corner of the planet is unaffected by changes that have been identified as due to human activity. The Secretary-General’s convening of yesterday’s High-level Meeting was a timely manifestation of the urgent need to strengthen international cooperation as an effective and adequate response to protect the environment and prevent the unacceptable exportation of pollutants to the developing countries.  One after the other  various diplomatic efforts to halt the violence in the Middle East once and for all have failed  but we cannot merely throw up our hands. No military solution will lead to peace and the tranquillity that all the peoples of the region so desperately call for. The invasion of Iraq  which we rejected at the time it occurred  is the tragic and painful proof of the truth of our position. The Security Council and the nations of the Quartet have the heavy responsibility of accompanying and  if possible  guiding a peace process that can succeed with courage and great perseverance.  The Argentine Republic continues  year after year  tirelessly to condemn the serious threat of terrorism throughout the world. We believe that all acts of terror are criminal and unjustifiable and that no argument can justify them. Just as no nation of the world is beyond their reach  the response must be a joint effort of all nations  and especially this Organization  to stop and eliminate this scourge. We cannot tolerate the actions of those responsible for terrorism or of those who defend  finance or protect terrorists  be they individuals or countries.  Argentina has twice suffered terrorist attacks. The Israeli embassy was attacked in 1992 and the AMIA headquarters in 1994. Some 102 members of our community  some of whose relatives are here with us today  lost their lives. Those victims  united by terror to those of this city  those of Madrid  those of London  those of Bali  those of Istanbul and those of many other places  impose upon us the moral mandate to respect their memories and to commit all our energies to hunting down  finding and prosecuting those responsible.  Despite the difficulties that have arisen through the passage of time  given that those attacks took place 13 and 15 years ago  respectively  and the subsequent cover-ups  our interest and the justice system continue to seek the truth  and we keep our memory of the horror alive so that it will not recur.  In November last year  the Argentine justice system called for international cooperation in the apprehension of nine people suspected of having initiated and planned the 18 July 1994 attack on AMIA  and the Executive Committee of INTERPOL unanimously recommended the apprehension of six Iranian citizens and one Lebanese involved in the affair. We call here for that recommendation to be ratified during the November session of the INTERPOL General Assembly.  In that context  we hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran  in the context of applicable international law  will accept and respect Argentina’s legal jurisdiction and cooperate effectively with Argentine judges to bring to justice those involved in these events. In that respect  I wish to say here  at United Nations Headquarters and before all the countries of the world  that  unfortunately  the Islamic Republic of Iran has to date failed to offer the required cooperation with the Argentine justice system to resolve those issues.   We call on the Secretary-General and on all the nations of the world to persuade the Islamic Republic of Iran to allow the judicial process to move forward. We do so with the sole aim of clarifying the facts and bringing those responsible to justice. Respect for the memory of our 102 victims requires justice to be carried out. We request the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate in the implementation of the norms of international law to allow us to come to nothing more  but nothing less than the truth.  Nations big and small  rich and poor  all throughout the world will be highly vulnerable if we fail to grasp that action against terrorism requires urgent multilateral  intelligent and sustained action firmly anchored in legitimacy  respect for individual rights  proportional response and respect for international public opinion.  Efforts to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction can count on the firm support and full participation of the Argentine Republic.   My country is known for the active role it plays in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Argentina develops  consumes and exports nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the framework of the strictest respect for the norms enshrined in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the non-proliferation regime in its broadest sense.   Efforts to prevent proliferation are ethically and legally correlated to progress on disarmament. Indeed  the legal instruments on which the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction is based specifically on the firm commitment not to develop new weapons of terror and destruction in the understanding that those who possess such weapons will proceed to their gradual and effective elimination.   In recent years  we have seen disarmament commitments permanently eroded. Nuclear arsenals remain disproportionately large and nuclear disarmament agreements are in stasis. It should come as no surprise  then  that  given the situation  there are those who question the legitimacy of pursuing unilateral advocacy for non-proliferation while solemn commitments in the area of disarmament are ignored.  Conventional weapons are responsible for the deaths of millions of people around the world. Our country has given a high priority to initiatives associated with the conclusion of an arms trade treaty. Domestically  we have initiated programmes for the voluntary handover of firearms  the initial results of which have been encouraging.   The reform of the Security Council is still pending. We are hoping for a reform that will make this central body more responsible  democratically representative and dynamic. It will not  however  achieve this objective by creating new privileged categories. We trust that the ongoing process of consultations will be successful so that the Council can be adapted to today’s world.  Before concluding I wish to raise a matter of continuing importance to the Argentine Republic: the question of the Malvinas Islands  which include South Georgia  South Sandwich and the maritime areas surrounding those islands. This year  174 years will have passed since the British began to occupy this part of Argentine national territory. Ever since that act of force in 1833  my country has protested against this illegal occupation and has demanded that the full exercise of its sovereignty be restored.  We would also mention that 2007 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 1982 conflict in the South Atlantic  a conflict unleashed by the military dictatorship without the backing of the Argentine people  who had always endeavoured to find a peaceful solution to its legitimate sovereignty claim.  The General Assembly has dealt with this matter on many occasions  both prior to and since 1982. Starting in 1965  when the Assembly adopted resolution 2065 (XX)  the Organization has recognized  year after year  the existence of a sovereignty dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom relating to the question of the Malvinas Islands. It urged the two Governments to negotiate  as soon as possible  a peaceful  just and lasting solution to the dispute  taking into account the relevant resolutions of United Nations bodies and the interests of the people of the islands. The ongoing and unrenounceable objective of regaining the full exercise of Argentine sovereignty over this part of our territory and the permanent readiness of my country to resume negotiations aimed at finding a solution to the dispute have been reflected in our national Constitution.  It is incomprehensible to us that the United Kingdom should be unwilling to negotiate this matter  thereby violating the provisions of General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX) and numerous similar resolutions.  The time has come for the United Kingdom to shoulder its responsibility and put an end to an anachronism: the illegal occupation for clearly colonial purposes of territory belonging to another State.  My Government vigorously rejects the British claim on the establishment of maritime areas surrounding the archipelagos. In particular  it rejects the recently divulged intention of the United Kingdom to make a submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf — established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea — relative to the outer limits of the continental shelf of these Argentine territories.   In this  my last message to the General Assembly as the President of the people of Argentina  I wish to reaffirm our profound conviction that it is only through democracy  accompanied by freedom  social justice and peace  that man can realize his full potential. This Assembly of the peoples has a bounden duty to help ensure that that will come to pass. "
"7",263,"ARM",62,2007,"Each opportunity to speak from this rostrum is a humbling experience  because I know that all the countries of the world listen to one another and try to discern and understand where our common approaches and interests lie. Those of us who represent small countries have a sense that this forum is a place where large nations address the ills of the world and that we smaller ones ought to stick to issues and topics that are specific to us and to our regions  as if addressing overarching  global issues were pretentious and best left to those with the power to do something about them.  Today marks my tenth year here  and I risk breaking the rule. This year  as financial calamities have compounded political and natural disasters  it has become very clear that  although our common problems and challenges threaten us all equally  they affect us unevenly. The small nations  which have less of everything — diversity  resources  manoeuvrability  means and options — are at greater peril and have greater susceptibility than those with bigger territories  larger populations and greater potential.  At the same time  the issues on the agenda of the General Assembly — such as peace and security  economic growth  sustainable development  human rights  disarmament  drugs  crime and international terrorism — know no borders  and none of us can address them individually if we want to see effective solutions. Finding solutions to these problems is in our common interest  for they are issues that affect all of humanity. And because these problems cannot be solved within our own borders  no one has either the right to abdicate responsibility for the consequences or the luxury of doing so.  When the speculative market drives the price of oil to $80  those who are too small to have significant reserves are the ones who are affected most  and large countries with large appetites for fuel sometimes make deals on energy matters that are not consistent with their policies. So do we  because energy security is not only a matter of global arithmetic; it is also a matter of life and death.  When climate change causes serious changes in the environment  it does not take much for a prolonged drought or an excessive rain to harm our agriculture and damage our economy or for rising sea levels to reach our cities. But we do not have the space or the diversity to cope and adapt.  When it is news that there have been no explosions in Iraq and when daily calamities are commonplace  we in the small countries begin to sense that we are vulnerable and susceptible to the will and the capacity of other members of the international community and  most important  to their tolerance of distant acts of violence and humiliation.  When development is dependent on the absence of bad weather  disease and war  and when the capacity to ward off at least two of those three ills lies in the hands of those who have the ability to bring peace and to heal  we in the small nations feel at risk and helpless.   When disarmament and arms control cease to be instruments for peace and security and instead become a means to reap political dividends  we in the small countries turn to our own means for self-protection. In other words  we become part of the problem  because the solution is not straightforward or visible.   Finally  when “Darfur” becomes shorthand for “helplessness”  we in the small nations of the world realize that power has replaced responsibility. The ubiquitous language of human rights cannot and will not compensate for a lack of political will to act. Genocide must be prevented  not commemorated.   Generation after generation  we find new places for appalling human tolerance of inhuman machinations and names for places of slaughter  mass killings and massacres of those who belong to a particular sector  ethnic group  race or religion. For Armenia  it was  for 100 years  the desert of Der el Zor; for the next generation  it was Auschwitz; later  it was the killing fields of Cambodia; and  more recently  it was Rwanda. If each one of those names  together with the word “genocide”  evokes ignorance  helplessness and the covering up of war crimes  “Darfur” today is synonymous with expediency  evasion and simple inconvenience. “Darfur” is synonymous with shame.  My appeal to the international community  on behalf of the small countries  is that it address each of these issues on its own merits and for its own sake  not as a piece of the global power puzzle. When tension rises between global Powers  it leads to polarization  and that in turn leads to a decrease in the capacity of small nations to carry out hard-earned policies of complementarity and balance. Our ability to be part of the process diminishes.  Let me state the obvious: we count on the willingness of the great Powers in the international community to set aside their disputes and to try to address these issues collectively. We also expect that they clearly understand that their power and influence do not make them immune from the consequences of the processes and problems that afflict us.  Last month  Armenia celebrated its sixteenth year of independence. During this period  we have weathered sea changes that have swept us up in regional and global processes that affect us in our daily lives. But we can only take pride in what we have accomplished during the same period: an open and diverse economy  high growth and strong financial systems  as well as improved elections  stronger public institutions and a population that is increasingly aware of its rights. All of that gives us the confidence and determination to address other ills facing our society — uneven growth  a high poverty rate  low pay — and to strengthen our human institutions and deepen our experience with democracy.   We have accomplished all of this under difficult circumstances. We still have a conflict to resolve with a neighbour; there are artificial limitations on Armenia’s ability to act; and regional cooperation is lacking.   The agenda of the General Assembly this year includes an item on protracted conflicts. Lumping all those conflicts together is an inherently flawed approach. Our own conflict in Nagorny Karabakh does not belong there. The United Nations is not the place to address it  because that issue is being addressed within the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Additionally  Karabakh is not a frozen conflict. We are negotiating with Azerbaijan and are inching towards a resolution.   Second  during this time  there has been an evolution of the process. We have a balanced  solid document in our hands that addresses not only the core issues but also consequential issues  and the two together add up to a reasonable solution.  Third  at the core of our process lies the right of peoples to self-determination. Indeed  the people of Karabakh do not want anything more than that which is theirs. They want to live in peace and security on their own territory. In other words  they would like to exercise the very right that every single nation in this Hall has exercised at some time in their history.   Speaking of conflict  we also follow very closely the events in Kosovo. We hear the international community loud and clear when it is said that Kosovo will not be a precedent for other conflicts. We are not attempting to make Kosovo a precedent for our conflict  because that contradicts our own principle that all conflicts are different. At the same time  however  we will not accept or understand the reverse logic  which holds that because Kosovo has been given independence  other peoples cannot achieve self-determination. No one should tell us that there is a quota for liberty and freedom.  At the end of the day  the willingness and understanding of small nations and their involvement in global processes cannot be a substitute for what major Powers with greater capacities and political will to act can do. In this age of openness and inclusion  there is no room for the old instruments of coercion and exclusion. Instead  we need new instruments of compromise and consensus so that we can achieve humanity’s enduring goal of living in peace and prosperity. "
"8",296,"ATG",62,2007,"Let me first congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. I also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon at this  his first General Assembly session as Secretary-General.  I am humbled to once again address this Assembly  and I stand before you humbled and emboldened. Humbled by the magnitude of the socio-economic challenges we face as a community of nations and emboldened by the trust that has been placed in me by the people of Antigua and Barbuda to articulate their interests in an increasingly competitive international system. I am further humbled by the gravity of the environmental challenges facing our world today and emboldened in the knowledge that without courageous and timely action  countless lives will continue to be plagued by misery and countless more unnecessarily lost.  As the Prime Minister of a small island State  I am also humbled and emboldened by the show of confidence we have received from the Group of 77  having been elected Chairman for 2008. It is not a responsibility that we take lightly  and you can rest assured we intend to rise valiantly to the task of chairmanship  executing the responsibilities of the Chair with the sort of professionalism and skill the Group rightly expects of us. As Chairman of the Group of 77 for 2008 and like the Chairs before us  we pledge to uphold the principles and objectives of the Group  to preserve  at all times  our collective interest as developing countries  safeguard our common positions  and  by so doing  achieve significant advancement in the development agenda.  I am humbled and emboldened enough to quote Albert Einstein  who once said:  “The world is a dangerous place  not because of those who do evil  but because of those who look on and do nothing.”  “Looking on and doing nothing” is no longer an option for any of us.  Let me  at the outset  unequivocally state that multilateralism should be the preferred means for effecting international peace  security and human development. There are some who would prefer for multilateralism to recede and for the world to be run by a few dominant Powers. They should be reminded of the intent and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations  which  among other things  reaffirms in its Preamble the faith of humanity: “in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”. It is no small wonder  then  that the crafters of the Charter pledged their determination “to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples”.  The Charter of the United Nations is perhaps more relevant today than it was at the time of its creation. The challenges to peace  security and development that require collective action have multiplied immeasurably. At the same time  humanity has so advanced that today it is possible to achieve the intentions of the Charter on a scale beyond what might have been achievable at the time of its crafting. Regrettably  fulfilment of the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations seems to be hindered to an unprecedented degree by a paucity of political will and determination.  However  an equitable international system responsive to the needs of all countries and people is not beyond our reach. In that context  there is a role for all nations  large and small  that includes the firm resolve to strengthen the multilateral system in order to correct systemic imbalances that hinder the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed development goals. Systemic imbalances in international trade  finance and international governance keep millions locked in poverty and millions more in a perpetual state of insecurity because they remain underrepresented.  Indeed  there is a role for all States. It should therefore come as no surprise that Antigua and Barbuda is of the view that small States can and should play a crucial role by being voices of reason — voices that are not shackled to the dogmatic positions that power necessitates. The absence of so-called high power allows small States to be pragmatic and practical in coming up with solutions to some of the most pressing international problems.  We can no longer continue talking while humanitarian conditions continue to deteriorate. The situation in Darfur calls for our immediate and swift action. We cannot continue talking while women and children are forced to live in refugee camps. We cannot continue talking while tens of thousands of persons continue to die.  We must act now. There must be swift action to strengthen the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur  which will support the African troops already there. Every citizen has the right to life and the right to live in peace. We call on all parties to end arm sales to the fighting factions. We must ensure that that happens.   While acknowledging the reality that the distribution of power is skewed among nations  we believe that talent  ability and good intentions remain in abundance in all countries  large and small. Further  no country is too small to be able to contribute innovative solutions to some of the most pressing international problems.  We in Antigua and Barbuda may be among the small and the powerless in terms of might and money  but we are willing and able to play our part to achieve international peace and development through active multilateral diplomacy  and we are intent on doing so.  Global poverty and economic inequality can be resolved only through sustained economic growth. Central to sustaining the economic growth of poorer countries is the establishment of a pro-development trading regime with a fair playing field  where large and small play by the rules — rules meant to create a fairer system and to allow the maximum benefits from international trade to be widely distributed among countries.  In that regard  we re-emphasize that it is important that individual United Nations Member States abide by fair trading practices  which eliminate targeted barriers designed to deny access to small  vulnerable countries seeking economic opportunities through such options as Internet trading.  Equally important is the need for Member States  big and small  to play by the international trade rules. The economic survival of our people depends on that. Our tourism and financial services sectors depend on that. Wealthy nations will ultimately have to pay a high price for actions that further pauperize already poor societies.  In a local context  the reduction of income inequality is a key priority for the Government of Antigua and Barbuda. My Government has ensured that affirmative action to ease the economic squeeze on the poor is embedded in all revenue-generating mechanisms. My Government resolves to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared among the entire population  by focusing on employment generation and the provision of free or low-cost social services in the areas of health and education  among others.  Climate change is a global problem requiring a collective response  and  if we do not respond quickly  the result will be disaster on a global scale. This represents a monumental test of the political will and courage of humanity in general  but especially of the political leaders of the most powerful countries.  For small island States  the challenge of adapting to climate change is not new; what is new is its urgency. The increased risk of natural disasters adds an extra dimension to the vulnerability of the island States of the Caribbean. Because of our size and the nature of our primary economic activities  the infrastructure of an entire country can be destroyed by  for example  the passage of a single hurricane. The livelihood of the entire population is at once threatened.  Antigua and Barbuda  like many of our Caribbean brothers and sisters  has had to place greater priority on disaster preparedness  resulting in increased competition for the already meagre resources of the governmental budget. Our situation is not unique.  I take this opportunity to highlight the importance of international action to support our efforts at disaster-risk reduction  through an ambitious climate change regime within the ambit of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That must  of necessity  include a commitment to increasing the level of international financing for adaptation in vulnerable countries.  The proliferation of crime in our already vulnerable societies represents a threat to the peaceful and stable communities for which the Caribbean is known. In all Caribbean societies  the bulk of violent crime is drug-related. It so happens that the bulk of narco-trafficking activity in our region is linked to illegal drugs bound for North America and Europe. That means that small Caribbean economies are required to pay a high price to protect societies to our north and in the Atlantic from drug shipments headed their way. We urge the United Nations family of agencies  in recognition of the link between globalization and crime  to provide the Caribbean with increased assistance in this area.  We also need the support and cooperation of individual Member States  particularly those that carry out a policy of criminal deportation. That practice parachutes graduates of metropolitan criminal systems onto societies in which they often have no families and no social network to assist in their re-entry into the vulnerable Caribbean societies from which they had long been exiled. That is a monstrous assault on several of our societies.   With regard to the problem of drug-related crime and the proliferation of handguns  Antigua and Barbuda reiterates its call for the strengthening and implementation of the various United Nations treaties on small arms and light weapons. The scale and scope of the disruptions and destruction caused by the proliferation of small arms in the hands of unemployed youth in the Caribbean is tremendous. Here  too  small developing States which produce no weapons are confronted by the tragedy wrought by guns manufactured in countries that fail to control their weapons of death and appear untroubled by the ease with which those weapons cross international borders. Even a miniscule increase in violent crime has a negative impact on development in small island States. These perspectives should inform the international debate on peace and security.  All countries  large and small  have a national interest in eliminating the threat to development caused by international terrorism. Antigua and Barbuda continues to play its part by adhering to the various anti-terrorism resolutions of the United Nations  including our obligations under Security Council resolutions 1540 (2004) and 1373 (2001)  among others.  Additionally  we have taken the added initiative to enact our own national legislative requirement by way of our National Anti-Terrorism Act of Parliament in 2005.  Combating international terrorism should not depend on the trampling of religious and cultural diversity and individual rights and freedoms. Cultural and religious intolerance and prejudice and the stifling of cultural diversity will only serve to perpetuate the causes of terrorism.  Earlier this year  Antigua and Barbuda  along with the rest of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  held activities to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. CARICOM also led an initiative for the anniversary to be commemorated here at the United Nations. That is an issue that should remain on the agenda of the United Nations. My Government is proud to have been a part of the initiative led by CARICOM member States at the United Nations to get the international community to recognize this anniversary.   Such international recognition is important because it provides the opportunity to carry forward the fight for justice. Despite all the modern treaties and international statutes and recognition of the slave trade as a crime against humanity  this crime remains unpunished; the entities remain unaccountable for their participation and profiteering. Maintaining international focus on this issue gives our nations and the world the opportunity to make progress in repairing the damage caused by 500 years of slavery and colonialism  so that those who profited from such a crime may be urged to take responsibility for rectifying the effects that remain today.  Progress may be slow in the fight for justice for the descendants of slaves  but we must not give up. As a community of sovereign nations  Antigua and Barbuda and the other CARICOM member States consider it necessary for the international community to become accountable for this crime against humanity. The question of reparations must be placed on the United Nations agenda now.  We urge the United Nations system and Member States to continue to pay special attention to the issue of gender equality and empowerment of women. The dividends from investing in gender equality and empowerment of women are two-fold: democratic gains  on the one hand  and development gains  on the other. My Government has placed top priority on empowering women politically and economically. The Speaker of the House of Assembly in Antigua and Barbuda is female. So  too  are the President of the Senate and the Clerk of Parliament. My Government has the honour of having the first female elected Member of Parliament  who currently holds the position of President of the Inter-American Commission of Women.  We have not stopped there. The Chairman of the Integrity Commission  pursuant to the Integrity in Public Life Act  is a woman. The Governor General of Antigua and Barbuda  appointed earlier this year on the advice of the Prime Minister  is female. The Ombudsman  a creature of the Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda is also a woman. The Chairman of the Public Service Commission  also a creature of the Constitution of Antigua and Barbuda  is a woman.  We continue to focus on increasing women’s participation in the political decision-making process. In that regard  we have been helped by the normative framework of the various United Nations gender entities. We will continue to work towards even greater gender parity in the political  economic and social spheres  and we encourage all Member States to do the same.  As we in the Caribbean grapple with the increase in HIV/AIDS cases  we are also confronted with another great threat to the survival of our people. Chronic non-communicable diseases have become a major concern for the Caribbean. Recently  an historic summit of heads of CARICOM on chronic non-communicable diseases held in Trinidad and Tobago agreed to give full support for the initiatives and mechanisms aimed at strengthening regional health institutions through the signing of a comprehensive declaration highlighting a plan of action on this critical health issue. We strongly believe that the health of the region is the wealth of the region  which underscores the importance of health to development.   It is therefore necessary for the United Nations  through its various organs and agencies  to lend support to our initiatives to develop strategies to prevent and control heart disease  stroke  diabetes  hypertension  obesity and cancer in the region by addressing their causal risk factors of unhealthy diets  physical inactivity  tobacco use and alcohol abuse  in addition to strengthening our health services. We must act together now to reduce the suffering and burdens caused by non-communicable diseases on the citizens of our region  which is the worst-affected in the Americas.  We seek the cooperation of the United Nations and our international partners in the development of initiatives for the screening and management of chronic diseases and risk factors so that  by 2012  80 per cent of people with non-communicable diseases will receive quality care and have access to preventive education based on regional and international guidelines.  Allow me to conclude on the point at which I began  by referring once more to the Charter of the United Nations. Sixty-two years ago  when the United Nations was formed  the international system was less complex and colonialism was still the dominant concern. Humanity was reeling from the effects of a second world war. It was not the best of times.  Today  in my opinion  it is still not the best of times for a majority of the people on planet Earth. The primary catalysts to positive change and improved lives for the global population are the United Nations and the leaders of its Member States. I am hopeful that sharing our collective wisdom  and drawing from this source  the sixty-second session of the General Assembly will translate into meaningful and enduring benefit for the peoples of the world.  I am equally confident that our deliberations on climate change will lead to solutions that will ensure the protection of our planet and its peoples. "
"9",343,"AUS",62,2007,"I join my colleagues in congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I would also like to wish His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon well for this  his first full session of the General Assembly as Secretary-General.   On behalf of the Australian Government  let me begin by reaffirming Australia’s long-standing call for reform of the United Nations. Australia strongly supports efforts to make the Organization more effective. And Australia would like to acknowledge Secretary-General Ban’s push for reform so far.  But reform of the United Nations is not an end in itself. We must reform the United Nations so that it can act decisively to meet global challenges. Simply talking about issues does not solve problems.  Over the past 60 years  when the United Nations has acted it has proved its worth. United Nations peacekeeping operations around the world have saved lives and helped communities rebuild. Australia has a proud history of supporting them. Australia was the first country on the ground in what was arguably the first-ever United Nations peacekeeping operation  the 1947 Consular Commission to Indonesia. In the past 60 years  Australia has made contributions to 39 United Nations peacekeeping operations  and we continue that tradition today.  The United Nations  as the only Organization with a truly global membership  has both a unique opportunity to meet challenges and a responsibility to take action. By coming together  we can achieve more than each of our countries could on its own. The United Nations has great moral authority. But  if it fails to act decisively  that authority will be squandered.  As Members of the United Nations  we have set ourselves important goals over the past 62 years: maintaining global peace and security  supporting economic and social development and advancing human rights. In 2005  we pledged to protect those people who are most vulnerable: those facing genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity. We recognized the responsibility to protect as a central tenet of our shared humanity.   This responsibility to protect underpins the notion that States must protect their own populations. But  if they should fail to do so  the international community has a responsibility to act  not to stand idly by in the face of atrocities  genocide or ethnic cleansing. For the international community  that means we must commit to prevent and respond to these most serious of crimes  wherever they occur. After the immediate crisis has passed  we must support recovery efforts to help communities rebuild and reconcile  by addressing the causes of the crisis.  Last year  the Security Council drew upon the responsibility to protect for the first time in a country-specific resolution: resolution 1706 (2006)  on Darfur. And  under a subsequent resolution  an African Union-United Nations hybrid peacekeeping operation was established  with a robust mandate to protect civilians and humanitarian workers. The international community must now ensure that the deployment of the Hybrid force proceeds quickly. Active cooperation is needed across the international community if we are to keep our promise to the people of Darfur. The alternative — to fail — is unthinkable. This is a test for the United Nations and its Member States.  But resolving the tragedy in Darfur is  first and foremost  a test for the Government of Sudan and other parties to the conflict. Ongoing military operations by the Government of Sudan  and last weekend’s killing and abduction of African Union peacekeepers by rebel forces  demonstrate the urgent need for the parties to stop these crimes and build peace. Those who have committed crimes in Darfur must be punished.  Australia calls on the Government of Sudan to act on the warrants issued by the International Criminal Court. We call on Sudan to arrest those accused and to hand them over to the Court.  Darfur is not the only humanitarian crisis we have experienced or will face in the United Nations. Tragically  other populations will also require protection from crimes against humanity. The responsibility to protect provides the necessary guide to action. But it is up to Security Council members  on behalf of the international community  to act  and for all United Nations members to then support them.  The events of the past week in Burma remind us of the irrepressible human impulse to seek democratic freedoms and human rights. The United Nations and individual countries must let the courageous protestors in Burma know that their message is understood — a message on the need to move towards genuine democratic progress and national reconciliation  and away from military domination.  Australia has joined the international community in condemning the violent suppression of peaceful demonstrations by monks and civilians. We call for the immediate release of those arrested for exercising their fundamental human rights to peaceful protest and for humane treatment of all those detained. Australia is also introducing targeted financial measures against members of the Burmese regime and its supporters to increase pressure on them to engage in genuine political reform and national reconciliation.  Australia supports the consistent efforts that the United Nations has made to monitor and improve the situation in Burma. We welcomed the statement by the United Nations Security Council following its special consultations on 26 September. We welcome the current visit to Burma by the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Envoy  Mr. Ibrahim Gambari  and his access to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. We urge the Burmese authorities to work constructively and meaningfully with him in support of his United Nations-mandated mission. Mr. Gambari is well placed to assist in achieving a peaceful resolution to the current crisis.  The responsibility to protect means that we  the international community  must act when confronted with the most serious of crimes. But we also have to act to confront a range of global challenges  from terrorism and climate change to poverty. Terrorists stand in stark contrast to those of us who seek to protect the vulnerable. Their goals are global and their reach transnational. No single country can solve the problem alone. There have been some successes in combating terrorist networks  but we need to develop even more effective strategies to disrupt and dismantle their networks.  Australia calls on Member States of the United Nations to implement fully all relevant Security Council resolutions on freezing the assets of terrorists. Terrorist organizations must be starved of their funds and support. Australia also calls on Member States to conclude a comprehensive convention against terrorism as soon as possible. A convention would provide a solid foundation for international cooperation to prevent  prosecute and punish terrorist acts.  The international community must support the efforts of States that fight terrorism — in particular  fledgling democratic States. We must help those States to establish strong democratic institutions and accountable Government structures  as State weakness can only allow terrorism to fester.  We should cooperate also to prevent man-portable air-defence systems from falling into the hands of terrorist groups. We should also intensify work on the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Australia urges Member States to join the Initiative.  We must also act to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Australia welcomes the robust action taken by the Security Council over the past year in imposing sanctions against programmes relating to proliferation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and also in Iran. The Security Council’s action on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea nuclear issue sent a strong signal to that country that the international community would not tolerate its nuclear programmes. We welcome recent progress in the Six-Party Talks. We call on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to maintain the momentum and implement fully its commitment to denuclearize.  The Security Council also sent a strong message to Iran. We welcome Iran’s stated intention to work with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to address long-outstanding issues. But the international community  including Australia  remains deeply concerned about Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran should suspend its uranium enrichment programme  as required by the Security Council  and cooperate fully with the IAEA.  Australia also hopes that the United Nations can continue its work in protecting populations by raising barriers against the illicit trade in conventional weapons. We support the development of an arms trade treaty.  Climate change is another challenge that clearly requires our urgent attention. Climate change demands an effective and enduring global response. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the forum to forge such a global response. On 9 September  the leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies issued the historic Sydney Declaration on Climate Change  Energy Security and Clean Development. The APEC leaders agreed to work to achieve a common understanding on long-term aspirational goals to reduce emissions and pave the way for an effective post-2012 international arrangement.  Significantly  the APEC leaders  whose economies represent over half of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP)  agreed that the post-2012 agreement needs to be comprehensive and that all economies should contribute to meeting shared global goals. They also agreed that our responses must be equitable and environmentally and economically effective  as well as capable of including diverse approaches.  The High-Level Event on Climate Change  hosted by the Secretary-General on 24 September  and the Major Economies Meeting on Energy  Security and Climate Change  hosted by United States Secretary Rice a few days later  highlighted these same goals and built additional international momentum for a post-2012 agreement. Australia calls on parties to this year’s United Nations conference on climate change in Bali to agree to a new mandate for the Convention that will move beyond Kyoto and forge a comprehensive new agreement.  The international community must also address pressing health and human security issues  in particular the spread of HIV/AIDS. Failure to combat HIV/AIDS will have global economic and social consequences. Australia takes its responsibility to act seriously and continues to support its near neighbours in the Asia Pacific region to address the challenge of HIV/AIDS.  The Australian Government believes that the challenge of ending endemic poverty remains the single most difficult economic and social issue  and yet the most fundamental one. In a world where international commerce moves at the click of a button  people should not be starving. Commerce and economic development have the power to lift people out of poverty. Free and open trade helps countries to develop through integration into the world trading system. We must conclude the Doha Round and deliver results that increase market access and reduce domestic subsidies.  Development assistance  too  plays a key role in alleviating poverty. At the United Nations Summit in 2005  Australia undertook to double its development assistance budget by the year 2010  and we are well on the way to achieving that goal  but this aid must be focused and delivered in a way that promotes broad-based economic growth and encourages good governance. We need to make long-term commitments  particularly in post-conflict development and reconstruction.   I have outlined today serious global challenges facing the international community — humanitarian and political crises  including in Darfur and Burma  climate change  poverty  weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. The Security Council has drawn upon the responsibility to protect principle  endorsed by leaders at the 2005 Summit. It is clear that the international community as a whole has a responsibility to protect those facing genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Our task is to respond quickly and effectively. The United Nations has been vested with great authority by its Members to effect real change. But that authority will mean little unless we turn commitment into action. "
"10",390,"AUT",62,2007,"Let me address at the outset a burning issue: the situation in Myanmar/Burma. We join the call of many  including our partners in the European Union and in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  for an immediate cessation of violence. The bloodshed has to stop. Democratic rights and the freedom of assembly and expression have to be respected. We reiterate the call for the release from detention of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi  the leader of the Burmese democratic opposition. That appeal was also made at this morning’s meeting of the Women’s Empowerment Network  which unites women leaders from around the globe.  We can all feel a sense of urgency at this sixty-second General Assembly session about the need to counter contemporary challenges with decisive joint action. Climate change  disarmament and dangerous technologies are just three examples requiring such joint action  now.  Let me thus call for relaunching effective multilateralism. And let me make the case for a new global partnership   the joint search for sustainable joint solutions  united by a shared sense of responsibility and purpose. The very concept of partnership is key in addressing the new challenges  both inside our societies and in the global village. Partnership is an eye-to-eye approach  based on recognizing and respecting each other as equals. Partnership is also a demanding option: anyone who wants to be treated as a partner has to behave as a partner.  We all know that none of us  not even the strongest  can master the challenges of the twenty-first century on his or her own. In the age of globalization  unilateralism and nationalism are dead-end streets. They simply do not achieve effective and durable results. We thus need both global processes and global objectives. We need to actively engage to build confidence and to counter the erosion of trust that so often breeds unilateral action.  Climate change is the obvious challenge to be addressed in such a new global partnership. The United Nations is the only framework in which a fair and truly global agreement can be designed. Regional and sectoral efforts need to be linked  feeding into this global process. Furthermore  it is here only that those who contribute least to climate change but are most affected by it   such as the small island developing States   can make their voices heard.  Disarmament  arms control and conflict prevention are next in need of a credible relaunch of multilateralism and a new partnership. In the nuclear age  we simply cannot afford to acquiesce to the present level of armament and to signs of a new arms race. Non-proliferation and an actual reduction of weapons stockpiles thus have to make an immediate comeback to the top of the global agenda.  On certain limited issues  multilateral progress is within reach. A consistently growing number of States is rallying behind our call for the adoption by 2008 of a legally binding instrument to prohibit cluster munitions  which cause unacceptable harm to civilians. Austria is determined to continue leading this process by example  with a total national ban of this atrocious weapon.  Nuclear technology is a third field for a new global partnership. The world is turning nuclear  whether we like it or not. This in itself is regrettable for countries like Austria which have renounced nuclear energy altogether because we believe it is a dangerous and non-sustainable source of energy. Inevitably  the rise of nuclear power across the globe will lead to more and more tensions with regard to the nature   whether for energy purposes or for weapons development   of national nuclear programmes. There is a highly dangerous grey zone between what is permitted and what is possible.  A new global partnership where sensitive parts of the nuclear fuel cycle are multilateralized could offer a way out. We should create a regime in which enrichment facilities would be placed under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Agency would guarantee adequate fuel supply to those who fulfil strict non-proliferation criteria through an international nuclear fuel bank. This would help to dissuade tensions and make new national enrichment facilities superfluous.  At present  the Iranian nuclear programme   for many reasons   is deeply upsetting for the entire international community  not just for some of us. Iran should take these concerns very seriously. It is clearly up to Iran to dispel any shadow of doubt over the nature of its programme by providing undisputable proof to the world’s nuclear watchdog  the IAEA  now. Like many others  we strongly support Director General ElBaradei’s appeal for a double time-out and urge Iran to heed this call.  Our engagement for peace and security is rooted in the firm belief that right must prevail over might. Smaller and medium-sized Member States like Austria understandably have a profound attachment to the rule of law. For us  respect for the rule of law is a matter not of choice but of necessity. Together with many other like-minded countries  we will continue promoting the rule of law and will give strong support to the newly established Rule of Law Assistance Unit.  Austria believes in the power of partnership  where equality  mutual trust and respect for diversity overcome the crude logic of power. From our experience  effective global partnership best builds on both regional partnerships and regional ownership. Austria is thus committed to developing a new relationship among equals between the European Union and the African Union  at the forthcoming European Union-Africa summit in Lisbon.  To this end  Burkina Faso and Austria will co-host a conference in Ouagadougou in November on how to create sustainable peace. The meeting will unite participants from countries of the Economic Community of West African States and Europe in an endeavour to provide a common input to the Lisbon summit   by furthering policies of good-neighbourliness  the rule of law and good governance; by fighting the proliferation of small arms and light weapons; by creating employment for young people; and by actively promoting the education of girls.  Together with the United Nations  the African Union is currently breaking new ground with the preparations for the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. The human suffering we witness in the region sometimes goes beyond imagination. We therefore welcome the ongoing efforts to alleviate this plight  including in neighbouring States.  We Europeans cannot credibly call upon other regions of the world to assume their regional responsibilities if we remain unable to cope with the challenges on our own continent  and in particular the Kosovo issue. We need to resolve the last open status issue in the Western Balkans now. We therefore fully support the ongoing efforts of the Kosovo Troika and encourage Belgrade and Pristina to energetically make use of that negotiating space. The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General  President Ahtisaari  has provided us with a clear sense of direction. We Europeans want each and every person in Kosovo to live in dignity  freedom and security. The international organizations concerned  including the European Union  must spare no effort towards that end. It is also our continued obligation under Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  which referred to the specific contribution the European Union can make to the stability of Kosovo as well as the entire Balkan region.  Women around the world are ready to bear a key responsibility in conflict prevention  conflict resolution and peacebuilding. But women also need to be given a fair share of positions in international mediation and peacebuilding efforts. Not so long ago  there was not a single woman among the 54 United Nations Special Representatives and Envoys to conflict and post-conflict regions. I am encouraged by the Secretary-General’s support on this matter and the recent nomination of three women Deputy Special Representatives: for Liberia  the Sudan and Lebanon. It is also up to us  the Member States  to nominate more women for such positions.  No conflict is too complex or too deep to durably resist dialogue. The absence of dialogue breeds misperceptions and sometimes even opens space for violence. Austria has long-standing experience in promoting dialogue among civilizations  religions and cultures  and we will continue our activities in that field with vigour. We must actively combat attempts to hijack religion for other purposes anywhere in our global village. Religious leaders must also take a clear stance in condemning and fighting practices not related to religion  such as so-called honour killings or female genital mutilation.  Austria firmly supports the current bilateral and international efforts that are taking place to renew the dialogue between Israel and its Arab neighbours. We hope that the meetings between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas will create the basis for implementing the two-State solution: Israel and a Palestinian State living as neighbours in peace and security.  We appreciate the efforts by the United States for an international meeting later this year to assist the parties in their quest for a just solution. We expect that meeting to advance the peace process substantially and sustainably by addressing the core issues  and we stand ready to assist in preparatory and follow-up activities. The people of the entire Middle East region are thirsty for a new perspective of hope.  In 2008 we will celebrate a landmark in the promotion and protection of human rights: the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its immutable foundation  the universality of fundamental rights. All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. It is therefore not acceptable that human rights be revitalized or diminished in relation to geography or other factors. There is no doubt that women must enjoy the same universal rights  wherever they live and whatever their culture  creed or religion.  Our peoples expect from their leadership nothing less than a life in dignity  but above all a life in freedom from fear and in freedom from want. If we are truly committed to human security  it is essential that we make every effort to meet the Millennium Development Goals by determined  concerted action to eradicate poverty and hunger  to promote equality between men and women and to protect our planet’s resources. The Austrian Government has made it an explicit priority to actively live up to the rising challenges.  Based on our long-standing engagement for the principles and values of the United Nations  I pledge that Austria will be a responsible and reliable partner as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the term 2009-2010. We hope that the Members of the United Nations will entrust Austria with that responsibility  which we stand ready to shoulder in a spirit of true partnership. "
"11",415,"AZE",62,2007,"I would like to add my voice to those of previous speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on the occasion of your election to the noble post of President of the General Assembly. I am confident that you will carry forward the able legacy left by your predecessor  Mrs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa. Our warm tribute also goes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  as he strives to reinvigorate our Organization.  We all have the great belief that in the twenty-first century the United Nations will be a more effective Organization. The continued relevance of this Organization will  to a large extent  depend on our ability to attune it to our concerns and make it responsive to our needs.   The United Nations must continue to serve the interests of all its Members States  regardless of whether they are big or small. Our approach to problems that transcend national boundaries should be based on a global consensus  while maintaining the key role of the United Nations in the cooperative management of these problems. We need to advance further and harmonize diverging views on the reform of the Security Council. The Council should be transformed into a democratic and respectful organ  reflecting its universal character  corresponding to present-day realities  and taking into consideration the need for balanced geographic representation in its membership.  The reform package should strengthen the General Assembly as the policy-making organ of the United Nations. It is only through reinforcement of the Assembly’s role and mandate that we can successfully tackle some of the most pressing issues facing humanity  not least the process of globalization.  This year  2007  marks the fifteenth anniversary of Azerbaijan’s membership in the United Nations. I will use this apt occasion both for reflecting on our experience and for looking ahead. The development of our region is inextricably linked to energy security issues. We in Azerbaijan have been working for more than 10 years on our energy security. When we started our energy projects  the development of oil and gas fields and construction of pipelines  we could not imagine that our energy resources would be so crucial in supporting the causes of free competition and free market. But it so happens that we are right on time and ready to provide an important contribution to global energy security.  Our firm dedication to the policy of economic  political and social reform allowed us to improve our economic performance significantly. Last year  we had a 34 per cent growth in gross domestic product (GDP)  and more than 35 per cent this year. In four years  the State budget increased more than fourfold. We managed to decrease unemployment and poverty significantly. A 36.8 per cent increase in the population’s income and savings in financial institutions is a direct indication of the improvement in livelihood.  Investments continue to play a catalytic role in the overall development of the country. In 2007  the level of investments from all financial sources has reached a growth of 10.6 per cent. Most important  as compared to previous years  the share of domestic investments currently accounts for a significant increase of 50.8 per cent  and a large part of it goes to the non-oil sector. These are very important steps towards achieving our goal of a diversified economy.  We believe that the sustainability of growth and development in Azerbaijan not only is ensured by the availability of natural resources but also attests to the commitment and capacity of the Government to protect the rights of investors and to implement its commitments under various contracts in the multibillion range.  Transparency and efficiency in oil revenue management constitutes an important part of the Government’s efforts to improve public service and accountability. Thus  it gives me great pleasure to inform delegates that the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan  which leads the implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in Azerbaijan  won the prestigious 2007 United Nations Public Service Award in the category of improving transparency  accountability and responsiveness in the public service. We believe that this success shows the efficiency of our Initiative  and we invite United Nations Member States to discuss the achievements made under the EITI. We plan to introduce a draft resolution on this subject during the current session.  Using our geographical location and unique transportation possibilities  we are pioneering projects on bridging Europe and Asia. Countries to the east of the Caspian Sea have expressed a vivid interest in these projects  and the role of Azerbaijan in regional affairs has become more important and has been transformed into a stabilization factor.  By dint of its political and historical background  Azerbaijan became home to various cultures and religions. Building on this rich experience  during its chairmanship of the Organization of the Islamic Conference Ministerial Council  our country provided substantial input to enhancing dialogue and broadening mutual understanding among nations  cultures and religions. We believe that by spreading knowledge about Islam and its values  cultural dialogue between the civilizations will contribute to mutual understanding and trust. In this regard  the framework of the Alliance of Civilizations provides a good opportunity for joint action and partnership.  Azerbaijan currently holds the rotating chairmanship of the GUAM (Georgia  Ukraine  Azerbaijan and Moldova) group. Our priority is to espouse GUAM geopolitical and geo-economic advantages  utilize its role as a natural corridor bridging Europe and Asia and promote the development of civil societies and the economic cooperation of GUAM Member States.  At the same time  GUAM serves as an effective instrument to increase the international community’s awareness about risks and challenges that its Member States have been facing. In this regard  I would like refer to agenda item 16 of the current session relating to the protracted conflicts in the territories of Azerbaijan  Georgia and Moldova. These conflicts have almost the same origin  similarly-developed scenario and dangerous outcome. They all started from the manifestation of aggressive separatism  were accompanied by ethnic cleansing against civilians and resulted in the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of these States.  GUAM is firmly convinced that the settlement of these protracted conflicts must be based on territorial integrity within their internationally recognized borders. Together with GUAM colleagues  Azerbaijan will defend this fundamental principle of international law  initiate formal discussions in the General Assembly and mobilize support of the United Nations Member States.  The Armenian-Azerbaijani Nagorny Karabakh conflict remains the most serious challenge to the security of our region. As a result of the conflict  we are still facing the continued occupation by Armenia of a significant part  almost 20 per cent  of the internationally recognized territories of Azerbaijan. We are hosting approximately one million refugees and internally displaced persons  who were notoriously ethnically cleansed and brutally expelled from their homes of origin in Armenia and in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan.  Azerbaijan’s position on conflict settlement is fully based on the norms and principles of international  law  plus four relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council that provide for the restoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and the establishment of vast opportunities for the Azerbaijani and Armenian communities of the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.  Negotiations on conflict resolution  which since 1992 have been carried out within the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group  have so far not yielded any results. The more time passes  the more difficult it is for us to observe from our side of the line of contact the attempts of the current Armenian leadership to consolidate the results of the occupation of our territories  their attempts to destroy everything associated with the Azerbaijani legacy in these territories and to carry out illegal activities thereon. The United Nations shall not tolerate such action. From this high podium  I would like to address the Armenian nation in order that they recognize that their policy of breaching peace and stability in the region has very dangerous  counter-productive and disastrous implications for the long-term perspective of development  above all  for Armenia. I am confident that Azerbaijan will restore its sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is only a question of time.  Finally  on this issue  I would like to express our gratitude to Member States for their unequivocal support extended in September 2006 to General Assembly resolution 60/285  entitled “The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan”. Although Armenia dissociated itself from the resolution after joining the consensus on it  we still believe that establishing the proper conditions for the environmental operation may become a significant confidence-building measure.  As a member of the Human Rights Council  Azerbaijan attaches great importance to the efficient functioning of the Council. It is our common task and responsibility to ensure that this institution lives up to the expectations vested in it and becomes a truly objective  vigorous and credible universal human rights body. We are looking forward to finalizing the institution-building of the Council so that it becomes fully operational and devotes attention to the issues directly within its mandate.  In the course of the last two years  the United Nations has continued to represent a unique platform for international standard-setting in the field of human rights by adopting two major documents — namely  the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Undoubtedly  adoption of those important instruments represents a significant step forward in a long historical process. Already a signatory to the first Convention  Azerbaijan is currently considering signing the latter. "
"12",461,"BDI",62,2007,"First of all  we would like to extend to Mr. Srgjan Kerim our warmest congratulations on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly for the current session and to say that the delegation that I have the honour of leading is greatly pleased to see him presiding over the work of the Assembly. We would like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the outgoing President  who conducted the work of the last session with great wisdom and distinction.  We would also like to convey to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  the great appreciation and encouragement of His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza  President of the Republic of Burundi  and of our Government  for the tireless efforts that he has been making since he took office to defend and promote the noble ideals of our Organization.  Building a viable world for humanity is a task that is incumbent upon the international community and every one of its members. Our position in Burundi is that  in strengthening peace and justice within our borders  we are also contributing to the harmonious development of this world. It is in this context that the Government of Burundi is sparing no effort both within the country and at the regional level to establish an environment conducive to the strengthening of peace and security  the rule of law and development.  We are pleased to state that the signing of the Comprehensive Ceasefire Agreement  which took place on 7 September 2006 between the Government and the Forces nationales de libération (FNL) rebel movement greatly contributed to a return to peace and stability in our country. That paved the way for talks on specific aspects concerning the implementation of the Agreement in a calm setting. Some weeks ago  the FNL movement unilaterally decided to suspend the talks without offering any truly convincing reasons. However  we are not discouraged because we believe that this is simply a hitch that will not have a lasting impact on the gains which everyone wants to preserve.  Efforts are currently being made for a prompt resumption of the talks. A regional summit on the issue should take place shortly to encourage the FNL movement to return to the negotiating table  which is the only acceptable way to achieve a lasting peace. In any case  the Government of Burundi remains open to all proposals that would bring together the necessary conditions for this effort.  The return to peace has also favoured the implementation of programmes that are priorities for the Government in areas such as national reconciliation  education and health for all  reconstruction and economic recovery. Issues related to good political and economic governance  once taboo because of their sensitive nature  are now openly and regularly discussed  and concrete action is being taken to improve the situation.  To achieve greater success in the delicate task of national reconciliation  the people of Burundi have no choice but to review together the history of their country which  in several ways  is characterized by some dark periods. Indeed  the Government has begun negotiations with the Secretary-General in order to set up a truth and reconciliation commission. We are soon going to begin national consultations on this question; the outcome should provide a solid basis for the establishment and operation of such a Commission. The civil war which ravaged our country greatly impoverished the Burundian population. We are eager to gradually resolve the problem of poverty and to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  we have taken measures to offer free health care to children under the age of five and to pregnant mothers in public health clinics  and also to provide free primary school education.  The Government has also set up the Strategic Framework for Accelerating Economic Growth and Reducing Poverty  which was adopted at the national and international levels and which was submitted to our development partners at the Bujumbura round table held in May 2007. Our country’s appeal to the international community had a positive reception: funding for our priority programmes for the period 2007-2010 has been pledged.   We take this opportunity to reiterate the gratitude of the Government and the people of Burundi to all of our partners for their generous contributions at the round table. We would be sincerely grateful if their pledges could be redeemed so that we can satisfy the most urgent needs of our population as soon as possible.   Working with the Peacebuilding Commission  my Government has also set up a Strategic Framework for Peacebuilding in Burundi. This is a framework that involves all of the national and international socio-political partners in contributing to strengthening the return to peace and ensuring that the resurgence of deadly crises will be a thing of the past.  We would also like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Commission for the positive results we have already achieved together  as well as for the support of the Peacebuilding Fund  from which my country has generously benefited.  We are convinced that peace and security can be affirmed only in one’s house and in one’s immediate environment. Burundi is playing an active role within the regional framework in the work of the Tripartite Plus Joint Commission  including the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Rwanda  Uganda and Burundi. This Commission is a suitable forum for us to discuss our security issues in a straightforward fashion — namely  the presence of many armed groups that are circulating and dangerously jeopardizing the democratic gains made in the development of our member countries. Moreover  on 15 December 2006  at the International Conference of the Great Lakes region  heads of State and Government of 11 member countries  including our own country  Burundi  signed a Pact on Security  Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region  with the ultimate objective of making this zone an area of peace  economic growth and sustainable and shared growth. Burundi had the honour of being elected by its peers to host the headquarters of the Executive Secretariat of this Conference.  Furthermore  in re-launching the Economic Community of the Great Lakes countries (CEPGL)  along with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and in joining the East African Community  which includes the United Republic of Tanzania  Uganda  Kenya and Rwanda  we are motivated by a desire to build a peaceful  prosperous and united world.  There are still tensions that mark the international situation and new sources of instability and uncertainty have emerged. It is undeniable that remarkable work has been achieved in recent years within the framework of our Organization  as well as in continental and regional organizations. Pockets of tension have now been eliminated  and others are on the verge of being so. However  we are concerned by the continuation of bloody conflicts in Somalia and Darfur  in Iraq  in the Middle East  to mention but a few. Despite the efforts that have been made and the means that have been deployed  there is still a great deal to be done. Burundi decided to lend its modest contribution to resolving some of these crises by providing military observers and police personnel for Darfur and military peacekeeping contingents in Somalia within the framework of operations set up by the African Union.  We know full well that conflict prevention is an ongoing concern of the international community. Stabilization efforts and peacekeeping operations are an eloquent testimony to this. We must accompany this process by strengthening the prerogatives of the Secretary-General in the area of preventive diplomacy to prevent minor conflicts from becoming larger  open conflicts. In this respect  conflict prevention can be effective only if we take into account the nagging question of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons  which is a dangerous  destabilizing factor.  We would like to launch a vibrant appeal to the countries that produce small arms and light weapons to adopt responsible export policies that would truly help to curb illicit flows of these weapons. The same applies to the question of disarmament  which our country considers crucial if we want a rapid return to security  peace and development. We say this from experience  because in Burundi  the proliferation of small arms and light weapons  as well as in other countries of the Great Lakes region  continue to cause destruction in terms of human lives and social and economic infrastructure  and it always un-does any reconstruction and development effort that we are trying to achieve.  International terrorism is another major challenge to global peace and security. This phenomenon can be seen on all continents  thus proving very clearly that terrorism knows no borders. The absence of a suitable and effective strategy to eliminate this scourge places us at its mercy. These situations should be one of the top challenges for the United Nations family. Our Organization  therefore  must be a tool at everyone’s service in all countries  a tool capable of raising hopes  of dispelling concerns and of restoring respect for the rule of international law.  In this context  we must all agree and decide to make our Organization more operational  more pragmatic  more democratic and capable of fulfilling its mission  a mission that is to be accomplished in full cooperation with the regional organizations whose effectiveness in the area of conflict prevention and intervention is well known  despite often insufficient resources. Thus  we express the hope that Security Council reform  which has long been advocated and discussed  will finally become a reality  with a composition that respects the representation of continents that  until now  have been excluded from the category of permanent members  such as Africa  our continent.  Although the cold war is over  we are forced to acknowledge that social relations have crystallized into two blocs with almost antagonistic and diverging interests — that is to say  the rich on one side and the poor on the other. It is high time to humanize relations between the two blocs and to encourage specific measures through respect for commitments that have been taken. Otherwise  we will see the continuation of new societal phenomena  such as the brain drain  worsening crime  sex industry and international migratory pressure  which stir up passions and spark controversy.  To conclude  Sir  the gathering of such a large number of high-level officials makes it possible to take the pulse of the political situation as well as of the international social and economic situation. It makes it possible for us to observe our weaknesses and our potential. We believe that solutions to the different problems that have been mentioned in the course of this debate are always possible  as long as there is a minimum of political will. It is that minimum  which is required of every member of our Organization  that we should all try to obtain together. "
"13",508,"BEL",62,2007,"We live in an increasingly complex world of ever more diverse challenges. Actions taken in isolation are no longer enough. Given such complexity  the United Nations should not only be a bulwark against arbitrary actions in international relations but also  above all  the vehicle for effective responses. I am pleased to note that there is growing consensus on this issue.  Climate change was the topic of a recent high-level event. A Security Council summit meeting has just addressed the situation in Africa. In addition to peace and international security  the United Nations must also tackle a wide array of issues. The fight against terrorism  pandemics  human rights  disarmament  migration and the environment are examples of the diverse subjects requiring a multilateral approach.  Multilateralism has been reinvigorated  especially in the areas of peacekeeping and security. The current 18 peacekeeping missions and the 100 000 Blue Helmets now in the field clearly attest to that. Belgium has witnessed that evolution up close since becoming a member of the Security Council at the beginning of 2007. We shall continue to strengthen multilateralism in that body.  In Africa  working through the United Nations  the international community has been actively engaged in the search for solutions to the issues of Darfur  Chad  the Central African Republic  the Democratic Republic of Congo and Côte d’Ivoire.  The efforts of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) have been crucial to re-establishing peace and setting up democratic institutions in that country. Now is not the time to scale back our efforts. The tenuous situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the resumption of fighting in North Kivu pose serious risks to the process of stabilizing the country. They also have tragic humanitarian consequences. Moreover  the scourge of the recruitment of child soldiers takes on new proportions. As pointed out by the Secretary-General  we urgently need a global solution  including a regional dimension that will allow us to make better use of MONUC’s input. While the Congolese authorities are preparing for local elections  which will strengthen democratic culture across the country  they need our full support. Belgium will continue to mobilize the attention of the international community on this important matter.  In Sudan  it is imperative that we make progress in our search for a political solution for Darfur. I encourage all parties to take advantage of the Tripoli conference in order to identify the elements of the conflict  such as the distribution of resources and power-sharing  and to establish the foundation for a lasting settlement. We need to speed up the deployment of the peacekeeping force  with the full cooperation of the Sudanese Government. Moreover  we will have to continue to consolidate reconciliation between north and south of the country.  Furthermore  the role of regional organizations in managing crises has significantly increased over the past year. The African Union has invested its efforts  both in Somalia and in Darfur  where new ways of cooperation with the United Nations are developing. The hybrid force is an example of this new form of cooperation.   As for the European Union  it has supported MONUC’s efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It will also contribute to curbing the humanitarian crisis in Chad and in the Central African Republic by sending a military force to support the United Nations missions in the region. Belgium will participate in this effort. The European Union has also developed a close cooperation with the African Union by supporting its efforts in crisis management  while paying close attention to the strengthening of its effectiveness. On the whole  we welcome this regional input and the increasing synergies among the United Nations  the African Union and the European Union.  Regarding Kosovo  it is  on the other hand  regrettable that the Security Council was unable last June to assume its responsibility on a matter for which the solution is essential for peace and stability in Europe. I urge both parties to seize this present opportunity to come to a compromise. This is a matter of urgency. The status quo is not an option  as we are all aware. Absent an agreement between the parties  Europe will then have to shoulder its responsibilities.  In the Middle East  the international community has mobilized in order to contribute to a solution to the crisis in Lebanon. By extending for one year the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  in which Belgium participates with close to 400 troops  it has recognized UNIFIL’s role in the solution of the crisis.   But the current political stalemate is alarming. All parties should demonstrate a sense of responsibility. The institutions should be allowed to function normally again  beginning with the election of the president in accordance with the constitutional process  in the assigned timetable and without foreign interference. The latest attack that claimed the lives of member of Parliament Antoine Ghanem and nine other people shows how impunity threatens the stability of the country. The establishment of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon is clear evidence of the support that the multilateral system is willing to provide to the fight against this impunity.  In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  neither the continuation of firing rockets at the Israeli population  nor the deterioration of the living conditions of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip  is acceptable. Regular meetings between the Palestinian and Israeli leaders constitute an encouraging development after so many years of misunderstanding and lack of true dialogue. I hope that these steps will be bear fruit at the international meeting slated for before the end of this year. Belgium actively supports any progress in the peace process.  The Security Council has recently reinforced the mandate of the United Nations in Iraq. The United Nations can  in fact  play an important role in humanitarian emergency matters  in regional cooperation and in national reconciliation. But its action will depend on the security conditions and will have to be able to rely truly on the support of the international community  the Iraqi Government and the neighbouring countries  as expressed at the 22 September meeting.  In dealing with the nuclear issue in Iran  Belgium has  from the outset  supported a multilateral approach. We have to resolutely use the multilateral mechanisms such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Security Council  in order to obtain tangible results. In the past  Iran has not fulfilled its obligations regarding the transparency of its nuclear activities. In order to restore confidence and to make the best use of the objective verification capacities of the IAEA  Iran will have to fully respect the regulations of the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and the Additional Protocol. However  the measures prescribed in Security Council resolutions go beyond those regulations and aim at creating the conditions for restoring international confidence in the Iranian nuclear programme. Complete and immediate compliance with these resolutions by Iran is a condition to resume the dialogue that had to be interrupted in 2005. The credibility of the Security Council is also at stake.  In Asia  the mission of good offices of the Secretary-General has made it possible for us to follow closely the situation in Myanmar. The latest demonstrations show the determination of the population and should finally incite the Government to initiate an inclusive dialogue with a view to restoring democracy in Myanmar. Use of violence will not be tolerated.  Beyond crisis resolution  progress has also been made in the area of peacebuilding. The international community must remain vigilant. The cost of leaving a country too quickly is always higher than investing in peacebuilding. The true success of the Peacebuilding Commission will be judged by the long-term stability of the countries currently on its agenda  namely  Burundi and Sierra Leone.  The recent adoption of concrete recommendations following the deterioration of the political situation in Burundi illustrates its increasing capacity to react quickly to events that could jeopardize the stabilization of the countries with which it is dealing. In Burundi  the dialogue must definitely be pursued in order to solve the political stalemate  which impedes the normal functioning of the State’s institutions. Every effort must be made in order to bring the Forces nationales de libération (FNL) back to constructive negotiations with the Government as soon as possible.  Three of the most recent and expensive peacekeeping operations have been deployed in countries where conflicts were fuelled by the illegal exploitation of natural resources  namely  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Liberia and Sierra Leone. That clearly illustrates the urgent need to develop mechanisms that break the link between the illegal exploitation of natural resources and conflict.   This issue was the central theme of our presidency of the Security Council last June. We identified several courses of action. For example  we must reinforce the capacity of the Secretariat to deal with such issues; define more precisely  as necessary  the mandates of peacekeeping operations; cause the sanctions committees to operate in a more targeted manner; and consolidate the methods of the work of experts groups. In the coming months  it is our intention to pursue our efforts in these areas  which relate to both security and development. We hope that we can rely on the support of Member States. Our attention to crisis management and peacebuilding must not diminish the importance that we accord to preventive diplomacy. I welcome the initiatives of the Secretary-General in this area  such as strengthening United Nations mediation capacities and upgrading the mandates concerning prevention of genocide and mass atrocities and concerning responsibility to protect. We also have to make this concept operational.  Conflict affects civilian populations long after the end of hostilities. The prevention of conflict should not overlook human security. That is why our country is working to promote an international instrument on cluster bombs; that is why it supports negotiations on a treaty on arms trafficking  and that is also why we are pursuing action against the recruitment and use of child soldiers.  Crisis prevention also entails development. Everyone should have the opportunity to choose his or her way in life with dignity. The alternative is frustration that often leads only to violence. The Millennium Development Goals and the fight against poverty therefore remain a major challenge.   In this context  Belgium pays special attention to good governance. Last March  in cooperation with the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  we organized in Brussels an international conference on good governance and the fight against corruption. That conference illustrated the potential in this area — triangular partnerships among donor countries  recipient countries and the private sector — which needs to be explored  including within the United Nations.  Poverty also forces many migrants to leave their country  having no other choice. In July 2007  Belgium organized  in the presence of the Secretary-General  the first Global Forum on Migration and Development. That was a new opportunity to demonstrate our firm multilateral commitment. It emerged that legal migration can be an opportunity for both the countries of origin and the countries of destination. In addition  with good cooperation between the countries involved  development can also foster migration by choice rather than by necessity. Belgium will contribute to the follow-up of this initiative with the Philippines  which will organize the second Global Forum in 2008.  Human rights are one of the pillars of our collective security. We must ensure respect for those rights under all circumstances. That is why in 2005 we emphasized the need for in-depth reform of the former Commission on Human Rights. At this stage  however  I regretfully note that the new Human Rights Council does not meet our expectations. An institutional agreement that was reached between the members of the Human Rights Council in Geneva in June came at the expense of difficult concessions. The capacity of the Council to react promptly to human rights violations will thus be compromised.  Multilateralism is back. Nevertheless  it is only a method  not an end in itself  and this method can be disappointing if it does not bring results. We therefore need an instrument that will animate multilateralism and adapt the United Nations to the current environment. Achieving our common objectives depends on developing a modern organization that is well adapted  well equipped and well managed. We will therefore need to consolidate the bases for a responsible and professional Secretariat.  System-wide coherence in the United Nations is also indispensable from this standpoint. In order to foster coherence of development activities by the United Nations in the field  the current reform effort has as its main objective to reinforce its efficiency for the benefit of developing countries.  After years of discussion  it is unfortunate that we have not been able to make progress on the indispensable reform of the Security Council. We undoubtedly need a new working method that would allow us to get the technical working group out of New York  where it is bogged down  and to involve the capitals and the political levels more. I therefore suggest appointing a high-level special envoy for Security Council reform  who would be responsible for leading these consultations and for presenting us with a proposal.  As far as I am concerned  my clear preference goes to a formula that would consist initially of an addition of new  semi-permanent seats  without modifying the current balance between permanent and non-permanent members. Later on  permanent members would accept to give up their right of veto.  The United Nations must serve the general interest of the community of Member States  as well as of the populations they represent. The United Nations will succeed only if those States manage to transcend the sum of their particular interests. It is the shared responsibility of each of us to display the necessary vision in order to put our Organization in the service of the common good. "
"14",553,"BEN",62,2007,"Mr. President  at the outset I should like to offer you my sincere congratulations on your brilliant election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I assure you of my delegation’s full cooperation. It will spare no effort to contribute to the success of the deliberations of this session  at your side  of course  because Benin is one of the Vice-Presidents.  I also pay tribute to the excellent job done by your predecessor  Her Excellency Mrs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa. Throughout her term she was able to give new momentum to the General Assembly by relaunching the dialogue on the implementation of the global partnership for development. Under her clear direction our delegations were able to thoroughly study the many questions that have been pending within the framework of the implementation of the conclusions of the 2005 Summit  and they have been able to assess the challenges to be met.   We also express appreciation to the new United Nations Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. He has been able to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor  Mr. Kofi Annan  by maintaining the pace of his reforms. Mr. Ban has not only maintained the momentum of the reforms but has also given them a visible personal mark that denotes a will to streamline in an innovative and consensual way the use of resources available for concrete action in keeping with the perils that confront us.   We support the United Nations  which must assert itself as an effective organization  capable of serving as a melting pot for multilateral  inclusive  productive and  conclusive cooperation in the search for appropriate solutions to the many challenges of our time.  These challenges include ongoing conflicts  the rise of extremism  the weakening and destabilization of entire regions  the continued impoverishment of the most vulnerable populations and the practice of trade subsidies and protectionism in developed countries. They deny us our comparative advantages and stifle our producers by distorting the international market. It is necessary and urgent to establish a safety net so that African countries affected by subsidies can compensate for the enormous losses that they suffer. In addition  social inequalities between States and within our societies are ever greater. The proliferation of endemic diseases decimates human resources. Malnutrition  desertification and coastal erosion dangerously reduce vital space and accentuate competition for survival  together with repeated flooding resulting from global warming linked to climate change.  We have indeed made considerable progress since the Rio Summit in terms of the implementation of instruments for global governance in the area of the environment. Given the warnings and many alarms that scientists have sent us in recent years we now need to accelerate their comprehensive implementation  because they give clear guidance to the efforts undertaken by men to restore control over phenomena and changes that jeopardize the conditions of our existence on Earth. It is urgent to maximize synergies within the framework of the implementation of these instruments to ensure greater effectiveness. That is one of the urgent tasks to be put on the agenda of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change scheduled for December 2007 in Bali  Indonesia.  The risks stemming from climate change are terrifying  particularly for low-income coastal countries such as Benin. They dictate that we act in advance instead of in response because we need to deal with well-established contingencies via a precautionary approach and by consistent implementation of the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. Beyond the vast investments required to deal with coastal erosion and the deterioration of lands  the eradication of poverty and improving the living conditions of the poorest sections of the population are essential aspects of efforts undertaken to strengthen the resistance of our societies to the negative impacts of climate change.   Above all we must increase our efforts to transform our patterns of consumption and global energy policies by using renewable energy sources. By way of example  switching from firewood to solar stoves would save many hectares of forests that are annually decimated by the poorest populations to ensure their energy supplies. It has been established that the manner in which the world’s energy needs  particularly those of developing countries  will be covered in the decades to come will be key to our ability to address climate change. We need to carry out a change of mindset to bring about a change in behaviour. To do this  the question of financing needs to be resolved in a clearly understood spirit of international solidarity and interdependence.  The international community will need to deliver on the pledges made in Monterrey and Gleneagles by mobilizing the funds to ensure implementation of the national programmes of action and adaptation and the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. It is fortunate that the high-level dialogue to be held in New York on 23 and 24 October 2007 and the meeting to be held in Qatar in 2008 will give us an opportunity to bring about a thorough evaluation of the situation in order to seek the optimum solutions to the problems before us.   Assessing performance in the area of financing for development is how we should measure the effectiveness of international financial institutions. Our hope is that appropriate reforms will be undertaken so that they will be able to fully shoulder their responsibilities in terms of mobilizing resources for poor countries so that they can make up the lag.  Special attention needs to be given also to internal constraints related to governance and to the meagre mobilization of local resources that curb economic and social development. The Government of Benin  for example  has intensified its efforts to root out corruption and promote transparent and effective management of public finances. Our efforts in these areas are coupled with measures to facilitate investment  including the establishment of a presidential investment council and the proclamation of free nursery and primary schooling  measures that have been judged to be essential for the continued strengthening of democracy  economic growth and social progress. The assistance from the international community is greatly appreciated and is now being directed exclusively to the goals agreed upon. In this regard  Benin has joined the peer review mechanism instituted by the African Union within the framework of the promotion of good governance and peacebuilding continent-wide.  Our search for solutions to the new threats can only progress if we are able to preserve international peace and security. It is disappointing that our efforts since the 2005 Summit to reform the body which has the primary responsibility for this  have been less than conclusive. We need to rekindle our fervour in order to give the Organization a Security Council that is more representative in terms of its membership and more transparent and effective in its working methods. Whatever the formula decided upon  reform of the Security Council cannot be viable if it does not take into account the realities of today’s world  which differ greatly from those of the 1940s. It cannot be fair if it does not rationally rectify the boundless harm done to Africa by excluding it from the category of permanent members of the Security Council.  Reform of the Council will undoubtedly reflect on its authority and its ability to fulfil its mandate in a satisfactory manner with respect to the situations concerning the fundamental principles of the Charter  such as the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict  which is more than 50 years old now. That conflict continues to destabilize the Middle East  and it cannot be otherwise so long as the vision of two sovereign  contiguous States has not been implemented and the occupied territories  including the Golan Heights and the Shaba’a farmlands  have not been returned.  We are also concerned by the continued arms race and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  as well as the stalemate in the multilateral negotiations. We need to stem the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons by adopting and implementing a treaty on arms trafficking. The proliferation of non-State armed groups  widespread violations of international humanitarian law and war crimes against civilian populations  particularly against women and children in situations of conflict  must continue to be given our unswerving attention. The perpetrators of these crimes need to be tried by the International Criminal Court  whose role as a deterrent needs to be enhanced by greater cooperation with the Security Council and the authority to initiate proceedings itself. We welcome the fact that great progress has been made in the deployment of a United Nations mechanism for monitoring and outreach on the recruitment and use of children in armed conflicts and on the possibility of it being extended.  Cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union within the framework of the implementation of the Union’s 10-year plan of support for capacity-building needs to be continued in accordance with the spirit of Chapter VIII of the Charter. Management of the situation in Darfur has given us a field for experimentation that will enable us to draw lessons to strengthen the effectiveness of this cooperation beyond the constraints and handicaps by looking at optimal solutions. We welcome the establishment of the hybrid force. Our hope is that its numerical and logistical capacities will enable it to deal with the crisis. We hope that similar efforts will be undertaken for Somalia.  The promotion of human dignity is necessary to be able continually to strengthen international peace and security. It is at the heart of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  proclaimed on 10 December 1948. We commemorate its sixtieth anniversary next year. This is an opportunity to undertake singular and proactive action to disseminate human rights for rural and peri-urban populations and communities  which are for the most part illiterate. These social strata have been cut off from the benefits of human rights but would be empowered and would become responsible for their own fulfilment if given access to human rights.   My country  which is firmly committed to democracy  here reiterates its unswerving commitment to make an effective contribution commensurate with its means to the protection and promotion of human dignity. That is the aim of my country’s proposal for a new agenda item at the current session of the General Assembly with the consensus title of “Celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights”. A draft resolution will be submitted and negotiated under this item. It could also serve as the framework for the proclamation of an international year for the promotion  dissemination and appropriation of human rights.  In that connection  my country  together with the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF) and all interested parties  proposes to organize an international conference in 2008 on the challenges and issues involved in democratic changes of government. I urge all United Nations Member States to support these  initiatives so that they will come to pass for the betterment of our peoples. "
"15",599,"BFA",62,2007,"I should like at the outset to express our sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am convinced that  thanks to his skill as an experienced diplomat  he will ably carry out his mandate. He can count on the cooperation of the delegation of Burkina Faso. I should also like to express our deep gratitude to his predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for the ability with which she led the work of the sixty-first session.   I would like  finally  to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon  who has shown  in the less than a year that he has been at the head of this Organization  his full-fledged commitment to peace and development and his firm determination to pursue  the ambitious work of modernizing the United Nations bequeathed to him by his predecessor  Mr. Kofi Annan.  As I speak to this Assembly  Burkina Faso has had floods this year  which have bereaved many families in all regions of the country. The dozens of death  the thousands of homeless people and displaced persons  the food crisis and the subsequent epidemics have implications above and beyond the statistics — the heavy price that a country  such as Burkina Faso  pays for global warming and all other phenomenon linked to climate change. It is my hope that the conclusions of the important summit on climate change held here on 24 September will promote the adoption of appropriate and urgent measures that will shield our populations from this type of scourge.  All types of tension are shaking the world and  in particular  the African continent  which gives us reasons to welcome the role played by our Organization in the search for and strengthening of peace and peacebuilding. Burkina Faso  which is the Chair of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  is mindful that no sustainable development can be contemplated without an environment of peace and stability and has made conflict resolution a key thrust of its diplomacy.  Therefore  President Compaoré has made a resolute commitment as facilitator to search for solutions to the crises that have affected the fraternal and neighbouring countries of Togo and Côte d’Ivoire. The Inter-Togolese Dialogue  which led in August 2006 to the signing in Lomé of a comprehensive political agreement. The agreement is bearing fruit  which pleases all those concerned. The latest session of the follow-up committee  which was held in Ouagadougou in August 2007  noted the conclusion of the electoral roll revision process and the setting of a date for legislative elections on 14 October 2007.  Prospects are encouraging in Togo and  on behalf of President Compaoré  facilitator of the Inter-Togolese Dialogue  I can confirm the sincere will and the real commitment of the people and the political class of Togo to get their country out of this crisis and to create the best conditions conducive to reconstruction  growth and development. And  in thanking the international community for their assistance  I would call on them to pursue their action for institutional reforms  peacebuilding and economic development in Togo.  In the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire  thanks to the Ouagadougou Political Accord  signed on 4 March 2007 by President Gbagbo and the Secretary-General of the Forces Nouvelles Guillaume Soro  the end of hostilities is now a reality. And so we should commend and encourage them to persevere to a final peace in Côte d’Ivoire. The facilitator of the direct dialogue in the Ivorian crisis  President Compaoré  who is President of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS at this time  is please to see all of the political class and the entire population of Côte d’Ivoire joining in the Ouagadougou Accord. This Accord translates the will of the parties to proceed with identifying people for an electoral enumeration and to organize a free  open and transparent presidential election. The Security Council  in its resolution 1765 (2007)  has endorsed this Accord.  I would like to express our appreciation to the United Nations  which has supported Burkina Faso in its efforts to establish peace and security  particularly in West Africa. In deciding to be a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council  for the period of 2008-2009  Burkina Faso hopes to make its contribution to the triumph of a world of justice and peace over the current world  where exclusion  intolerance and frustrations generate violent acts of despair. At this time  I would like to reiterate our thanks to the member States of the ECOWAS and the African Union (AU) who decided to make the candidacy of Burkina Faso an African candidacy. Our hope is that all Members of this Organization will give us their trust. We will be worthy of it.  Burkina Faso remains concerned by situations of tension and conflict in Africa and throughout the world. We welcome the decision of the Security Council to deploy a hybrid United Nations-African Union force in Darfur (UNAMIS). Burkina Faso has decided to participate in it  as we have done in a number of other theatres of operation. I would call upon the international community to give peace a chance in the Sudan by giving this hybrid force the logistical and financial resources necessary for accomplishing their mission. As for the protagonists  they will have to do everything they can to make the upcoming talks an important milestone in the process of national reconciliation and in bringing peace to the country.  We also think about the persistence of conflicts in Somalia and between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The Saharan zone  which includes the north of Mali and Niger  has also been hit by armed conflict. Burkina Faso has expressed its solidarity to those two neighbouring countries and hopes that durable solutions will allow for peace to be re-established and will allow for the promotion of socio-economic development.  We are pleased about the political developments in Sierra Leone  a country which has just had great success in organizing free  democratic and transparent general elections. This is the most recent illustration that democracy and good governance are gradually taking root in Africa. Throughout the continent  this principle of good governance is part of the political agendas.  We also congratulate the Moroccan Government for having initiated direct talks with the Polisario Front on the future of the Western Sahara. By this direct dialogue the two parties are  together  proving their ability to look for a mutually beneficial political solution. We would strongly encourage them to do so  convinced as we have always been that only a negotiated  political solution will put an end to this conflict.  Because it is at the heart of any lasting peace in the region and throughout the world  the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must remain an absolute priority for our Organization. In this respect  it has been established that the only solution is the creation of a Palestinian State that is viable with secure and internationally recognized borders alongside a State of Israel that is also certain of its security. And this is now where all efforts should be focused.  In welcoming the existence of nuclear-weapon-free zones  Burkina Faso is also calling for a responsible  just and equitable approach to the so-called nuclear crises. My delegation is very much concerned by the proliferation and the trafficking of small arms and light weapons  which for the victims are truly weapons of mass destruction. In West Africa  the phenomenon is particularly disturbing and its eradication requires sustained cooperation among States  as well as significant support on the part of the international community. Burkina Faso  which is the Chair of ECOWAS  has decided to make a priority of this issue.  The West African region is also in the process of becoming a key centre of drug trafficking. That situation requires urgent and appropriate action on our part  since it is likely to destabilize States  particularly by disrupting their economies and increasing the level of organized crime and corruption. Therefore  we call for solidarity and support from the international community to help us eradicate this scourge as swiftly as possible.  Those worrisome issues will certainly be on the agenda of the conference on peace and security in West Africa and the role of the joint European Union-Africa strategy which my country will host in November 2007. A joint initiative of the Republic of Austria and Burkina Faso  that important meeting will be an opportunity to identify the underlying causes of conflict and to formulate solutions capable of ensuring the sustainable development of countries in the subregion.  The current situation in many countries reminds us of the cruel reality of terrorism  which remains among the most pernicious of challenges and thus the most difficult to overcome. We must therefore demonstrate greater solidarity to contain it. In particular  we call for diligent implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and  in that connection  effective international cooperation to strengthen the current legal arsenal and the conclusion of a comprehensive convention as soon as possible.  By working for sustainable peace  we offer our States the best guarantee for their economic development. Nevertheless  the current international economic reality  which is characterized by globalization and excessive liberalization  continues to batter economies such as that of Burkina Faso. What is more  these fragile economies must contend with unfair trade rules.  Several years ago  President Blaise Compaoré  by launching his crusade against subsidies for Northern cotton growers — a crusade that was also carried out on behalf of his peers in Benin  Mali and Chad — sought to put an end to one of the most cynical practices of international trade. We hope to see the conclusion of the Doha Round of negotiations  which will place development at the heart of international trade.  Millions of men  women and children — particularly in Africa — are waiting to benefit from the positive impact of international trade in the hope that it will contribute to their development and to the improvement of their living conditions. For them  poverty and misery are not statistics or assessments  let alone projections. They are the mother who  because there is no drinking water or no health facility within a distance of 10 kilometres  sees the baby whom she bore with difficulty die in her arms; they are the child who is eager for knowledge but who will never go to school; they are the father who sees his only son confront the wrath of the sea and jeopardize his life in search of a supposedly better life on some shore. Those are the daily tragedies to which all of us here can attest.  We have the means to act. We must act quickly. We must act now.  For a number of years  we have engaged the United Nations in a process of qualitative change to equip it with the means to deal with the demands of the modern world and to be able to effectively fulfil the aspirations of peoples. However  while the achievements are considerable  the task remains vast and the expectations pressing. Thus  we must demonstrate the will and the discernment to give the Organization viable structures and adequate means. Burkina Faso hopes that  at the end of this process  the historical wrongs committed against Africa and other parts of the world will be corrected  particularly at the level of the Security Council.  We also deplore the ongoing injustice committed against the Republic of China on Taiwan  whose legitimate aspiration to participate fully in world affairs has been denied. Nevertheless  that country is a good example of successful democracy and social and economic development. By depriving 25 million men and women of the right to make their contribution to the realization of United Nations principles and objectives  our Organization is also depriving itself of its own quest for modernity and universality. Therefore  it is a new United Nations  open to all  that Burkina Faso earnestly calls for.  Burkina Faso reaffirms its faith in multilateralism and in the role of the United Nations as an irreplaceable instrument for peace  development and the promotion of dialogue among peoples  which it is our historic duty to preserve and strengthen. "
"16",642,"BGD",62,2007,"I would like to take this opportunity to express to you  Mr. President  my delegation’s sincerest congratulations on your well-deserved election. A special tribute goes to Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  for their visionary and dedicated leadership.  Recent events in Bangladesh have aroused considerable interest worldwide as we struggle to fulfil the promise of democracy for our people. I will take this opportunity to share with the global community some of our recent experiences in consolidating democracy. We have learned that democracy is not an event; it is an ongoing process. It is not just about casting votes and changing Governments; it is also about social justice  accountability and empowerment of the people.  Those who have followed events in Bangladesh over the past few months will know that the Caretaker Government came into office in January this year amid a political stalemate. The fabric of our democracy had been torn apart by years of catastrophic corruption. Widespread frustration with the status quo had led to a rising tide of political violence. That in turn had disrupted ordinary life and shattered all public confidence in the possibility of credible elections. Moreover  there was little hope that a tainted election could end the cycle of violence. A state of emergency was therefore declared on 11 January of this year in an effort to end the ongoing chaos and to usher in a new beginning.  As stipulated in our constitution  the non-party Caretaker Government acts as a bridge between two successive political Governments. Our task is  first and foremost  to ensure a free and fair election  and we are fully committed to fulfilling that responsibility. However  our nation has learned through harsh experience that an election cannot simply be a one-off casting of votes  but must be part of a dynamic and continuing process whereby people freely choose their leaders.   While Bangladesh has held three elections in the past two decades  our democracy has been brutally undermined by ruinous corruption. The lack of systemic institutional safeguards allowed corruption to run rampant. That created a winner-takes-all electoral system  whereby the spoils of electoral victory were so great  and the stakes of winning so high  that the political process became hopelessly polarized  leading to a paralysis even of ordinary governance. As the benefits of winning elections increased  so did the costs of securing victory  creating a truly vicious circle in which corruption became the linchpin. Corruption thus became both the means and the end in terms of winning elections. If our democratic spirit is to emerge unscathed from that downward spiral  and if we are to deliver free  fair and meaningful elections  we must first free our politics from the clutches of corruption and violence.  Democracy and the rule of law are not merely concepts; they must be embodied in functioning public institutions. In Bangladesh  the very institutions that form the foundations of democracy have been eroded by ongoing corruption. Rebuilding those institutions and restoring public confidence through meaningful reforms are Herculean tasks  but they are ones in which we cannot and will not fail.  In Bangladesh  the task of conducting free and fair elections is the responsibility of the Election Commission. The Caretaker Government has already overhauled the Commission  guaranteeing its independence and giving it a broader mandate. The Election Commission  of its own accord  has announced a timeline for the holding of the next parliamentary election by the end of 2008. Our Administration is committed to ensuring that that timeframe is adhered to. We will bring to bear the full resources of the Government in that effort.  Our Government has reorganized the Independent Anti-Corruption Commission to ensure that it can effectively lead the fight against corruption. We have given the Commission broad and sweeping powers — including operational independence — not only to apprehend those who have been corrupt  but also to work as a deterrent. Within a month after coming into office  our Government acceded to the United Nations Convention against Corruption as a clear signal of our unwavering commitment against corruption.   The implementation of the Convention will not only contribute to the reduction of corruption in Bangladesh  but will also help us to recover the ill-gotten gains of corruption stored abroad. Those who engage in corruption must confront the reality that there is no safe haven for them. The world is united in the struggle against corruption  and today Bangladesh pledges itself an active partner in that endeavour.  One of the most critical elements of a functioning democracy is an independent judiciary. In Bangladesh  the lower judiciary and criminal prosecution were traditionally under the executive branch of the Government  contrary to the constitutional principle of separation of powers. While judicial independence has been part of the political manifesto of successive governments over the past 15 years  each has repeatedly reneged on its public promises in this regard. Recognizing the importance of an independent judiciary to the rule of law  the Caretaker Government within its first month in office initiated the necessary steps to fully separate the executive and judicial branches of the Government. We have also revamped the Bangladesh Public Service Commission and the University Grants Commission in order to restore the apolitical nature of those important institutions.  Political parties are among the core constituents of democracy. Their accountability and true democratic character remain critically important for democracy to function. In response to demands of the people  the main political parties have themselves initiated various reforms  and the revamped parties will interact with the revitalized institutions of the Government to move our nation forward.   Bangladesh reaffirms its unflinching commitment to universal and inalienable human rights. Any society committed to democracy requires the recognition and enforcement of human rights  and in Bangladesh the fight against corruption and the strengthening of the rule of law go hand-in-hand with the protection of human rights. The Caretaker Government has  therefore  taken the decision to establish a national human rights commission to ensure that our laws and public institutions reflect international standards and norms of human rights. It is unfortunate that successive Governments have shied away from taking this important step.   Bangladesh remains resolute in its relentless campaign against international extremism and terrorism. We recently acceded to the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Bangladesh is now a party to all terrorism-related United Nations conventions  a testament to our commitment to fighting terrorism in all its forms. On the domestic front  we have taken stern measures against militant groups and their patrons. In particular  we categorically reject the claims of those who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of Islam to justify terrorism. Bangladesh is steadfast in its commitment to curb religious fundamentalism in all its manifestations.   Our experience in re-instilling confidence in the Government has a wider relevance to the international community. The problems that we are facing today are not unique to Bangladesh. After all  in the developing world democracy does not necessarily ensure good governance. Many countries face similar problems of political violence  mis-governance and corruption. This is particularly true for post-conflict and transition societies  where the politics of mistrust is pervasive. We feel that a greater understanding of our challenges and  more importantly  of our efforts to re-build political and social institutions  can serve as benchmarks for others facing similar situations. For example  Bangladesh represents an effective model of civil-military cooperation in crisis prevention. Our experience in crisis management could be relevant for many crisis-torn  nascent democracies.   One way in which we can share our experiences in governance is through our robust presence in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We have consistently been one of the top troop-contributing countries in the world  and our peacekeepers have earned accolades for their contributions. We are confident that Bangladesh will continue to play a leadership role in multi-dimensional peacekeeping efforts  and we are ready to provide comprehensive deployment packages in future peace operations. We also remain active in the United Nations peacebuilding endeavours in post-conflict societies.   We warmly welcome the Secretary-General’s timely initiative to restructure the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The world is witnessing a natural evolution from the monitoring of peace to multidimensional tasks of peacebuilding  democratization and development. As one of the largest troop-contributing countries (TCCs)  we strongly feel that the TCCs should have equitable representation and play a greater role in deployment and other strategic decisions.   The United Nations is in the midst of a continuing evolution. It is our collective responsibility to make the United Nations more relevant to the present day world  to fulfil the promise Dag Hammarskjöld spoke of when he said  “The day will come when men will see the United Nations and what it means clearly.” The Secretary-General’s report on system-wide coherence presents several useful recommendations in this connection. However  we feel that the reform exercise should focus on the requirements of achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  and we recognize that the speed of reform must be gradual.   We must reflect upon what is needed by the United Nations  in terms of financial and human resources  to foster development. Keeping in mind that developing countries differ greatly in their political  administrative and social structures  the reform exercise must take this diversity into account and allow individual countries to determine the structure of the United Nations presence at the country level  the representation of different United Nations agencies and their country programmes. We must not undermine the identities of individual United Nations agencies  including their mandates  independence and institutional integrity.   Earlier this week  we discussed the exceedingly important issue of climate change. World leaders reaffirmed our shared commitment to address the issue of global warming. Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to global warming  given that as much as 30 per cent of our land will be submerged if the Bay of Bengal rises by just one metre. The adverse effects of global warming  deforestation and increased salinity are already evident in Bangladesh. Floods have become an annual calamity  and this year our people have suffered particularly severe losses owing to flooding. While the resilience of our people and the quick mobilization of our limited domestic resources helped us to overcome the crisis this year  we envisage that this may become harder in the future. We therefore urge enhanced international cooperation to meet the challenges of global warming and its consequences.   There is a growing acknowledgment that trade liberalization can be an effective tool for economic development. For the least developed countries (LDCs)  the trade-to-gross domestic product ratio averages about 58 per cent  while it is roughly 25 per cent for many Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. These statistics show that the LDCs are far more dependent on trade than their developed counterparts. Bangladesh  along with many other LDCs  is facing significant tariff and non-tariff barriers in accessing developed markets. Global trade regimes must provide unimpeded access to all products of LDCs  so as to ensure that the fruits of progress are shared by all.   While representing a nation of 140 million people  squeezed into an area roughly the size of New York State  I must underscore the importance of migration to our development efforts. For many in Bangladesh and other developing countries  temporary labour migration provides a livelihood option and a route out of poverty. If we are to reduce poverty by half by 2015  we must strengthen our efforts to ensure the free movement of labour. The international community is recognizing the critical linkages between migration and development. It is encouraging that the Global Forum on Migration and Development  held in Brussels this July  accorded migration its due priority. We must also intensify our efforts to defend the rights of migrant workers. We would also like to see momentum in the liberalization of Mode IV services. We call for renewed international efforts — at the World Trade Organization and in other forums — to facilitate the free movement of labour services.   Let me conclude by reiterating my Government’s unswerving commitment to democracy and the protection of human rights. We have pledged to put Bangladesh on a higher trajectory of good governance  rule of law and development. We are determined to hold a free  fair and meaningful election within the timeframe stipulated by our independent Election Commission and to keep our country firmly on the path of democracy. My Government is fully committed to ensuring that our reform initiatives are comprehensive and irreversible. Bangladeshis now stand united for a prosperous future for their country and the world. "
"17",688,"BGR",62,2007,"It is a privilege and an honour for me to address this audience and to represent Bulgaria in its new status as a State member of the European Union. Having subscribed to the statement made by the Prime Minister of Portugal (see )  I would like to assure the Assembly that  as part of the European family  my country is now even more committed to the universal and normative role of the United Nations in today’s globalized world.  I warmly congratulate you  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are delighted to see in the leadership of this body an outstanding representative of a neighbouring State and of our region  South-Eastern Europe. I reiterate that my country fully supports the priorities you have outlined for the work of this session. We wish you every success in the months ahead.  Our gratitude goes to Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her leadership as President of the sixty-first session. I also take this opportunity to commend the dedicated and energetic performance of the Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon  during his first nine months in office. (spoke in French)  I would like to thank the President for having chosen climate change as a central theme for our debate. That world challenge calls upon all of us to provide an immediate response based on shared but differentiated responsibilities of Member countries. We welcome the fact that the high-level event on climate change held on 24 September has given considerable impetus to future negotiations on a new international agreement  which will benefit broadly from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.  Global warming is exacerbating the serious economic and social problems that developing countries are facing. It also threatens the implementation of development goals set by the international community  including the Millennium Development Goals. In that regard  we join other countries in supporting the recent United Kingdom initiative calling for urgent action to meet those goals. Bulgaria is prepared to play its part in solidarity with developing countries.  Unfortunately  the list of serious threats to our common security is not short. Non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  arms control and disarmament continue to be at the forefront of the international scene. Strengthening the regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to make it truly universal remains one of the major priorities of our time. It is regrettable that no progress has been achieved on the pending question regarding Iran’s nuclear programme.  Bulgaria reaffirms its support for the United Nations Programme of Action on Small Arms. We are firmly committed to the process towards adoption of an international treaty on the arms trade in the near future.  My country unambiguously condemns terrorism and rejects terrorist ideology in all its forms and manifestations. Terrorism cannot be linked to any specific culture or religion. The United Nations must continue to play a central role in mobilizing the international community to meet this challenge and to meet the related challenge of radicalism and political extremism.  In order to combat terrorism  we must first address the fundamental problems of poverty and underdevelopment  overcome prejudices and stereotypes and promote tolerance in a world of great diversity. That is why Bulgaria has joined the Group of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations  fully supporting other complementary initiatives as well.  The situation in Iraq continues to be a source of concern for the international community. This calls for the commitment of the United Nations. Bulgaria is participating in joint efforts to ensure that Iraq will be able to achieve its vision of a safe  unified and democratic State.  Afghanistan is another example where a powerful need has been felt to see increased involvement of the United Nations  along with NATO and the European Union  to support the difficult national reconstruction process.  Progress towards peace in the Middle East is of primary importance for the international community. Bulgaria welcomes the resumption of bilateral talks between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert and hopes that they will lead to a just and lasting solution in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the Quartet principles. Lebanon too continues to require a strong commitment on our part to secure its national unity  territorial integrity  recovery and reconstruction.  Today  the role of the United Nations is no longer solely to maintain peace  but to ensure that peace is firmly rooted and sustainable. The Peacebuilding Commission is now up and running. We believe that it has great potential  and its position vis-a-vis the principal organs of the United Nations must be strengthened and better defined. We see the future of the Commission as a modern multilateral instrument for the long-term resolution of conflicts.  The institution-building process in the Human Rights Council has led to a compromise. We believe that this has led to opportunities for us to make the Council an effective international tool to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.  Bulgaria fully shares the view that human life has supreme value and invites Member States to support a draft resolution on a moratorium on and abolition of the death penalty.  For multilateralism to be effective  it must involve strong partnership between the United Nations and regional organizations. We heartily endorse the growing interaction between the United Nations and the European Union. The recently updated Joint Declaration on United Nations-European Union Cooperation in Crisis Management has provided a new avenue for joint action. In addition  the United Nations and the African Union are involved in an unprecedented peace operation  the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur  for remedying the critical situation in Darfur. We also welcome the pragmatic cooperation established between the United Nations and NATO.  Various forms of regional and subregional cooperation have always been the cornerstone of a global system of collective security. Bulgaria is now chairing two regional organizations: the Central European Initiative and the South-East European Cooperation Process. Regional cooperation in South-East Europe has grown stronger and is gaining momentum. The Stability Pact  which was launched at the initiative of the European Union in 1999  has provided important impetus. In accordance with the concept of regional ownership  the key role today has been assumed by the South-East European Cooperation Process. Agreement on the creation of a regional cooperation council secretariat has just been signed by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the member countries in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv.  Bulgaria is now leading this process and will spare no effort to strengthen the prospects for European integration for the entire South-East European region. Our priorities focus on cooperation in sectors such as infrastructure  security  energy  the environment  tourism  justice and domestic affairs.  The unresolved status of Kosovo has a negative effect on security in the entire region. We regret that the Security Council has not been able to adopt a new resolution to replace resolution 1244 (1999) and thus to confirm its backing for a negotiated solution on the basis of the proposal of Special Envoy Ahtisaari. Bulgaria steadily supports all efforts aimed at reaching  as quickly as possible  a viable and legitimate solution with respect to the status of Kosovo. Such a settlement would guarantee regional peace and stability; it should take into account the interests and the concerns of neighbouring countries.  Thanks to the efforts deployed by the Contact Group Troika  we now have perhaps the final chance to find a negotiated solution. We hope that Belgrade and Pristina will be able to take this opportunity to find a compromise that can open the path to a new European future. While these talks are under way  it is essential to prevent any worsening of the situation. The international community   first and foremost the United Nations  NATO  the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe   are working together with local institutions  and they must continue to provide the necessary instruments and the guarantees to preserve regional stability.  Promoting democratization  stability  security and cooperation is a major challenge in the Black Sea region. Consistent efforts are required so that we can arrive at a settlement of the of the frozen conflicts in Transdniestria and in the southern Caucasus  which continue to undermine stability and hamper regional cooperation.  Bulgaria actively supports the formulation and implementation of the Black Sea dimension in the policy of good-neighbourliness with the European Union. Major projects have been started in important sectors such as transportation  energy  trade  environment and border security. Stability and predictability in this region are more important than ever to ensure energy security in Europe and to ensure the diversification and reliability of energy supplies to the continent.  Bulgaria is firmly convinced that in order for the United Nations to play its role effectively worldwide  it must steadfastly pursue the radical reforms identified at the 2005 World Summit. Progress was achieved at the sixty-first session  but much remains to be done so that the reforms meet the international community’s hopes.  Despite the good-faith efforts of the mediators  no tangible progress has been seen on a question that has been discussed at length: reform of the Security Council. My delegation supports the recommendation to move this process forward to the negotiation phase  with a view to reaching a broadly acceptable compromise that would take account of equitable geographic representation. It is obvious that reform of the Council will not be an easy task. We will require interim solutions at various stages over a certain period of time. The first step  however  cannot be put off indefinitely  because if we are unable to reform the Security Council  then broad reform of the United Nations will be incomplete.  A critical consideration of the implementation of a number of pilot countries in the One United Nations Initiative has revealed positive results. But consensus has yet to emerge on how to further the process of attaining system-wide coherence in the work of the United Nations. We hope that the final outcome will take the form of improved and increased development assistance  which would go together with a United Nations synergy in the concerned countries and the competent structures.  In conclusion  we should recognize that progress has been made in a number of reform areas. But we have not yet achieved enough. Bulgaria expects that the remaining tasks on the United Nations reform agenda will be pursued energetically and without delay. To that end we appeal to Member States to show more flexibility on the decisions needed to ensure the consistency of the reform process. It is in our common interest to ensure that the sixty-second session is a success. So let us work together and with goodwill to make it happen. "
"18",733,"BHR",62,2007,"It is my pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  upon your election as President of the Assembly at this session. There is no doubt that your expertise and your knowledge of international affairs will ensure anther successful session this year and will contribute to fulfilling the aspirations of our peoples for the United Nations.  I take this opportunity to express my deepest thanks and appreciation to our dear sister  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  and to commend her for the way in which she so ably and wisely guided the work of the Assembly. As a result  serious ideas were put forward that yielded tangible results for the development of the Organization and the revitalization of its role. In that respect  we want to express our appreciation to all delegations that displayed a spirit of cooperation with her during her presidency.  I have the pleasure also to thank His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his ongoing efforts to strengthen and develop the role of the United Nations. We are confident that the Secretary-General’s long experience as an able diplomat will enable him to undertake further efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of our international Organization.  In our joint endeavours to achieve world peace  prosperity and justice  we must address the challenges and dangers confronting our world today from a standpoint of faith in our one human destiny. We should realize that international security is based on joint efforts to guarantee regional security and the stability of States. At the same time  international peace requires respect for international legitimacy  the rule of law and justice. Since comprehensive development is a national and international requirement  it is important that we collectively and seriously face threats regardless of their forms or manifestations  such as conflict  war  nuclear proliferation  terrorism  environment disaster  poverty  backwardness and extremism  in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions and decisions adopted by the General Assembly  including the United Nations Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2).  The resolution containing the Millennium Declaration was a unique and pioneering endeavour which embodied a consensus among the world leaders who set out the goals we must reach in this new millennium. In this respect  the Kingdom of Bahrain is proud  by the grace of God  to have witnessed comprehensive political developments in its democratic march forward  under the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa  King of Bahrain  where free and fair elections were held with broad participation.  Meanwhile  its comprehensive development efforts were crowned by the United Nations presenting the 2006 Special Citation of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme Scroll of Honour Award to His Highness Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al-Khalifa  Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bahrain. This reflected international appreciation for the developments that continue to be witnessed by the Kingdom  especially in the field of urban development.  Social and economic achievements  under the patronage also of His Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa  Crown Prince and Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defence Force  have continued unabated. They are based on strategies and policies designed to ensure the welfare of all citizens by encouraging investment  strengthening the national human rights machinery  reforming the labour market and developing the education sector.  In the decades since the establishment of the United Nations  our world has witnessed both unipolar and bipolar world orders. Worldwide events and the ensuing results proved that such orders were not enough to guarantee security  peace  stability and prosperity in the world. Therefore  the time is now right to enable everybody to participate effectively in a universal system based on a just multilateralism that guarantees collective work towards achieving common goals.  We  as the United Nations  pledged in the Charter  in the name of our peoples to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights. That calls upon the international community promptly and effectively to address threats to international peace and security. At the forefront of those threats are the ongoing regional issues that the Middle East faces on various fronts  the most important of which is the situation in the Palestinian and other occupied Arab territories.  In this respect  we welcome the initiative of President George Bush of the United States to convene an international conference on Middle East peace this year. We hope that this will mark the beginning of a new stage in dealing with the core issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict in a just and equitable manner  putting an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people and to the occupation since 1967 of the Palestinian territories  the Syrian Golan and other occupied Arab territories in sisterly Lebanon. It should also lead to the establishment of an independent  contiguous and viable Palestinian State  with Jerusalem as its capital. Such a State should also be able to engage in development and to live in peace and stability with all States in the region  including Israel  in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative  United Nations resolutions and other relevant international agreements and terms of reference.  The second front is represented by the events in brotherly Iraq  whose people suffer from continued insecurity and instability as a result of the ceaseless waves of violence and the killing of innocent people. It is our view that the responsibility for breaking out of this vicious circle and achieving national reconciliation and stability lies primarily with the Iraqi people and their political leadership. To enable Iraq to do that  there must be no interference in Iraq’s internal affairs  and its borders must be fully respected. We stress here how important it is for neighbouring States  the Arab League and the United Nations to continue to support the legitimate Iraqi Government and its efforts to maintain security and stability in Iraq and to preserve its Arab and Islamic identity.  It seems clear that the attainment of stability in Lebanon is closely bound to free national reconciliation  and to strengthened national  Arab and international efforts and support for Lebanon’s legitimacy  with a view to preserving its security  safety and stability. Lebanon is an integral part of the system of regional peace and security in the Middle East and as such should be supported. We express our regret at the assassinations of many politicians  officials and innocent people in Lebanon. We hope that Lebanon will overcome the current crisis so that its people can live in security and peace.  The stability and unity of the Sudan are fundamental pillars of the political  economic and social unity of Africa. We commend the decision of the brotherly Sudan to agree to the deployment of a United Nations-African Union hybrid force in Darfur. In that context  we hope that the parties to the conflict in the Sudan will come together for the sake of their country and its prosperity. The Kingdom of Bahrain recently joined the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  because of its belief in the Agency’s important role in strengthening nuclear non-proliferation. In order to avoid a nuclear arms race in the Middle East  the Kingdom of Bahrain underlines the importance of freeing the region from nuclear weapons. It therefore urges the parties concerned  including the Islamic Republic of Iran  to be more transparent and to cooperate fully with the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) so as to build tranquillity and peace of mind among neighbouring States in the Gulf. The Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the right of all States to utilize nuclear power for peaceful purposes. It also demands that Israel place all its nuclear facilities under the comprehensive safeguards regime of the IAEA and become a party to the NPT in order to promote the Treaty’s universality.  In order to promote friendly relations and cooperation between members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran  the Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the right of the brotherly United Arab Emirates to recover its three occupied islands. It hopes that the two countries will increase their efforts and their contacts to resolve this issue either through direct negotiation or by referring it to the International Court of Justice.  Global climate change has become one of the most dangerous challenges threatening the world and its inhabitants. Climate change not only has an impact on the environment  but also severely affects the world’s economic and social order and hinders development. We therefore call upon all States to cooperate in order to identify solutions and ways to deal with this phenomenon. Here I wish to commend the high-level event on climate change  convened by the Secretary-General on 24 September 2007 in New York  on the theme “The future in our hands: Addressing the leadership challenge of climate change”.  Our faith in a single human destiny requires us to consolidate a culture of peace  brotherhood and dialogue among all nations and peoples and to abandon phenomena of hatred  discrimination and division — including what has been dubbed Islamophobia — which some are promoting to incite upheaval and hatred between peoples in order to serve their own narrow political agendas and interests. Those individuals forget that Islam is a monotheistic religion and that it stresses brotherhood  love  coexistence and tolerance. We hope in this context that the High-level Dialogue to be held by the General Assembly on 4 and 5 October will contribute to reinforcing the values of tolerance  understanding and respect for religions and cultures.  The Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the importance of joint efforts towards a new international environment  in which we can achieve our hope and aspiration to live in peace  security and stability in a world in which mankind will also live in respect  dignity and humanity; a world in which nations will achieve development and build prosperity and well-being; a world that will accept the cultures of others in peaceful coexistence  free from hatred and intolerance; and a world that believes in the unity of human destiny and will work to attain security  prosperity  justice and peace for humankind.

"19",771,"BHS",62,2007,"I am proud to address this body as the representative of the Government of the Bahamas. We are committed to achieving a sense of security  well-being  pride and prosperity for the people of the Bahamas. We look forward to working with fellow Member States towards securing the same opportunities and freedoms for all people.  On behalf of the Government and the people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor for her leadership and dedication and for so aptly guiding the work of the sixty-first session.  I would like to take this opportunity to extend congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his appointment as the eighth Secretary-General of the Organization. My Government is confident that  given Secretary-General Ban’s experience and diplomatic skills  he will aptly guide the Organization in facing its challenges.  Let me take this opportunity to commend the General Assembly’s adoption of the historic resolution 61/19  on the two-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and on the commemoration of the International Day held on 25 March of this year. The Bahamas  where the majority of our people are proud descendents of freed slaves  is participating at both the national and the regional levels in a number of commemorative activities. We fully support the project aimed at erecting a permanent memorial at the United Nations in commemoration of that shameful period in the history of our world.  At a time when the international community is engaged in serious reflections regarding the history and consequences of slavery and the slave trade  the Bahamas wishes to recognize Haiti as the only country to liberate itself from slavery and for the inspiration this provided to the international campaign against slavery.  Since modern forms of slavery still exist and since many people continue to be held in servitude  we must not relent in our resolve until everyone is able to enjoy and exercise the freedoms which this Organization has worked so diligently to recognize  uphold and defend.  Despite Haiti’s proud history  challenges have beset our neighbour for generations. Haiti’s return to democratic order last year was especially welcomed  and we celebrate the strides Haiti is making along the difficult and arduous road to peace  security and development. We heartily commend President Préval and his Administration for their stewardship of this demanding process. At the same time  we also commend the Organization of American States for its unstinting support for the people of Haiti.  The United Nations Mission in Haiti continues to play a vital role in this process  and the Bahamas supports the call for that mission to be maintained so as to consolidate the gains made to date and thus place our Caribbean Community (CARICOM) sister country on a firm and lasting path to sustainable development  peace  security and democracy. We urge the international community to support the people of Haiti in that quest.  As Haiti lies merely 90 miles from the southern shores of the Bahamas  its economic and political situation can and does have very tangible repercussions for us all. Each year  the Bahamas is challenged by the arrival of thousands of illegal migrants from Haiti who  by perilous means  journey to our shores in search of a better way of life. Ensuring that justice and democracy prevail in Haiti  therefore  has a positive impact not only on the people of Haiti  but also on the Bahamas and indeed the entire region.  The role of the United Nations in matters of sustainable development is crucial  particularly with regard to challenges demanding a truly global response — challenges such as climate change. We commend the Secretary-General for bringing greater focus to the issue  with the convening of the high-level event on climate change last week  and are hopeful that the event will provide the necessary impetus for action when Member States meet in Bali later this year. The Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is indeed the appropriate forum for negotiations on a post-Kyoto agreement  and the political will demonstrated during the Secretary-General’s recent high-level event should only bring closer focus to an agreed agenda in that regard.  For small island developing States and archipelagos like the Bahamas  climate change is a matter of critical importance. For many of us it is not just a matter of economics  but a matter of survival  as 80 per cent of our landmass is within five feet of mean sea level; even a one-degree rise in atmospheric temperature can have devastating ecological effects. Climate change is particularly challenging with respect to the potential effects on our tourism industry  which is our main industry and which generates some 60 per cent of the Bahamas’s gross domestic product. We therefore cannot overemphasize the need for an ambitious mitigation agenda for the post-Kyoto regime. Recent studies have shown that there are many mitigation options available  and many of them are win-win. We must therefore  with unwavering commitment  explore these options in an open and inclusive environment.  For countries like the Bahamas  resources for adaptation are also essential. However  even access to existing funds can prove difficult given the country’s gross national income. It is therefore vital that the relevant financial instruments and mechanisms be fully operationalized and/or improved so that they become more accessible and better address the peculiar circumstances and special needs of different countries. Further  there is a need for greater international cooperation with respect to the development of new technologies  as well as the transfer of such technologies in support of the sustainable development of small island developing States.  We in the Caribbean region must prepare for the possibility of continued increases in the incidence of natural hazards such as hurricanes  floods and earthquakes. Whether it is through assistance with hazard mapping and vulnerability assessment standardization or through the implementation of early warning systems  international cooperation has an important role to play in complementing national efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters.  One step taken by the Caribbean region was the establishment of the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility under the aegis of the World Bank. We would like to thank those countries who have contributed to the fund. The Bahamas continues to press for the execution of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States  as well as of complementary frameworks such as the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the Hyogo Framework for Action. The time has come to reassess our collective response to these issues and to renew our efforts in support of sustainable development.  Adequate financial resources are essential in the implementation of the wider internationally agreed development goals. Consideration of issues surrounding the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development is particularly significant this year  as we prepare for the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus  to be held in Doha next year. The Bahamas would wish for the deliberations of the upcoming High-level Dialogue  as well as the 2008 meeting of the Economic and Social Council with the Bretton Woods institutions  the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  to provide practical input into  and contribute to the success of that most important review conference.  The issue of strengthening the voice and participation of developing nations in international economic decision- making and norm-setting is especially important to the Bahamas. There is a definite need for concrete  realistic proposals to ensure the effective  permanent representation of developing countries  particularly small developing countries  not only in the Bretton Woods institutions and the WTO but also in the other international economic and financial institutions  such as the Financial Stability Forum  the Financial Action Task Force and the Basel Committee.  The Bahamas welcomes the positive development in the area of international cooperation in tax matters  namely  the establishment of the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters within the Economic and Social Council. The establishment of that Committee ensures that the interests of small developing States Members of the United Nations with different tax regimes will be factored into discussions and recommendations aimed at adopting mutually agreed standards that do not unduly favour the wealthy nations at the expense of meaningful development in States and jurisdictions not members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  We have reached the halfway mark in the time frame we set ourselves in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to undertake concrete steps by the year 2015 to address not only the economic and environmental challenges plaguing the international community and the Organization  but various social ills as well. In so doing  we gave those who are less fortunate hope for a better and more equitable world.  The MDG Report 2007 demonstrates that progress has been achieved in the reduction of the proportion of people living in poverty  the reduction of child and maternal mortality rates and the increase of primary school enrolment levels. However  nearly 20 million children worldwide continue to be severely malnourished and suffer from various preventable diseases that will undoubtedly affect their survival and rob them of their full potential. Overall progress in achieving equal rights and the empowerment of women is also too slow. My Government regards effective and practical measures to address poverty and the enhancement of educational partnerships to facilitate the development of our human resources to impact accelerated change as critical issues.  HIV/AIDS remains a global threat to the development  progress and stability of our societies. If the goal of universal access to comprehensive prevention  treatment  care and support by 2010 is to be achieved  commitments entered into in the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the 2006 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS must be implemented. The necessary financial and technical support to developing countries must be provided to help bridge the gap and foster a more comprehensive and sustainable global response to this pandemic.  Equally important is the fact that 63 per cent of deaths worldwide are attributable to non-communicable diseases resulting from factors such as obesity  high cholesterol  high blood sugar  high blood pressure  tobacco use  physical inactivity  unhealthy diet and alcohol abuse. At a recent summit of CARICOM heads of Government  a number of action steps were identified. The Governments have agreed to establish  by mid-2008  comprehensive plans for the screening and management of chronic diseases and risk factors  so that  by 2012  80 per cent of people in the Caribbean region with non-communicable diseases would receive quality care and have access to preventive education based on regional guidelines.  In spite of the efforts of various entities and the existence of United Nations conventions to protect the rights of women and children  discrimination and violence against women and children persist throughout the world. In an effort to better address this problem  the Bahamas has drafted a new Child Protective Act and a Domestic Violence Protection Order to enhance and provide greater protection to these vulnerable groups.  Last year the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) was adopted  marking an important step towards the elaboration of a counter-terrorism convention. The Bahamas continues to condemn terrorism and recognizes that while there may be instances when terrorism and criminal activities converge  the methodologies used to combat each of them are very different. Based on its own risk assessment  therefore  each Government must determine the level of resources that can be adopted and applied to counter-terrorism measures  particularly given the emphasis that the Strategy also places on addressing and preventing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism.  In prescribing counter-terrorism measures  care must be taken by the international community to preserve the tenet of due process. Care must also be taken to guard against the creation of disincentives that negatively impact countries with service-based economies. With respect to counter-terrorism measures  the Bahamas has adopted new legislation  ratified additional anti-terrorism conventions  increased security of large facilities  airports  docks and harbours developed a counter-terrorism intelligence network and provided anti-terrorism training for the police. Needless to say  such initiatives present a challenge and divert resources from our economic development.  The Bahamas reaffirms its commitment to fulfil its obligations to major international drug and counter-terrorism conventions and continues to support the concept of the expansion of the membership of the Security Council. The Bahamas maintains  however  that such expansion of the Security Council will not greatly increase the chances for our particular countries  such as the Bahamas.  While it is incumbent on Member States to fulfil their obligations that come with membership  the Organization must put in place effective management tools and create a system that would eliminate overspending and waste and create more fiscal accountability and proper oversight.  The Bahamas values the role of the United Nations as the custodian of the interests of the world’s people  in particular the poor and the vulnerable. The Bahamas continues to believe that the United Nations Charter constitutes a viable and firm foundation on which the Organization can balance and achieve its objectives: to maintain international peace and security and  equally important  to promote development and economic and social progress.

"20",796,"BIH",62,2007,"It is my honour to participate in this meeting of the General Assembly sixty-second session as Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  I would also like to congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency  and to express my respect and gratitude to Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for successfully presiding over the sixty-first session.  The United Nations and all other organizations depend on the collective strength of their members. That strength should be drawn from the consensus of the Member States. On that note  I would like to express my regret for the loss of momentum in Security Council reform. For the past several years  our countries’ representatives have met at the global level and have been prepared to realize the goals of the Millennium Declaration  in which the United Nations plays a distinguished role.  It is well-known that  in the recent past  my country paid a high price for the imperfect and inefficient United Nations system. The United Nations admitted its mistake and emphasized in its first report on Srebrenica that the United Nations experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina was one of the most difficult and painful in the Organization’s history. The report further noted that Srebrenica clarified the truth the United Nations and the world learned too late: Bosnia and Herzegovina was as much a moral obligation as it was a military conflict  and Srebrenica will haunt us forever.  On 27 February 2007  the International Court of Justice ruled on the application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina versus Serbia and Montenegro. The International Court of Justice ruled that genocide was committed against Bosnian Muslims in and around Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Members will agree  of course  that this was not an isolated case. That is one more reason for our determination and commitment  shared by a majority of the Member States  to the necessary reform of the world Organization.  In that light  Bosnia and Herzegovina is of the opinion that only a strong United Nations can be an efficient instrument in regulating international relations  in accordance with the United Nations Charter and international law. Apart from the necessary reforms  it is also essential to revitalize the United Nations  including the General Assembly and its committees  the Economic and Social Council  the Secretariat and other bodies.  That would include defining a number of issues  such as Security Council membership categories  the number of members  selection procedures for new members  veto powers  regional representation  working methods  and so on. Those attest to the complexity of the ongoing reform. A productive step forward will inevitably lead to essential negotiations in that context  rather than to the usual ongoing consultations. I should like to emphasize Bosnia and Herzegovina’s interest in reform that would create a larger Security Council membership  and thus an additional seat for the Eastern European Group.  Multi-ethnic and multireligious Bosnia and Herzegovina  with its rich historical heritage and experience of the failures of the international community  primarily the United Nations — failures that had troubling consequences for my country  but also positive results in post-war peacebuilding alongside United Nations representatives  bodies and agencies — could contribute greatly to the United Nations becoming an effective instrument in the collective management of international relations.   My country believes that there can be no peace or stability without economic and social development. My country maintains its support for the Security Council as a critical body for international cooperation  peace and the development of the rights of all nations. Having met its historic challenges  Bosnia and Herzegovina is now able to share its experiences with a troubled world. Bosnia and Herzegovina is thus determined to intensify ongoing activities leading to its non-permanent membership of the Security Council from 2010 to 2012  and looks forward to the support of the majority of Member States for that membership.  I come from a post-conflict country that has moved towards becoming a modern democratic society and taken the path to European and trans-Atlantic integration. That is why my country is truly committed to the strengthening of international cooperation on the regional  European and global levels.  It is with great pride that I can state today that Bosnia and Herzegovina is an active participant in all regional south-eastern European initiatives and processes. In 2007  Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognized for its proactive regional stand. The South-East European Cooperation Process (SEECP) summit in Zagreb adopted the decision to make Sarajevo the regional cooperation council centre. Creating the regional cooperation council is the final step in the transformation of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe  meaning that SEECP member States will assume regional responsibilities. With that decision  the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina will become a future regional cooperation centre  and Bosnia and Herzegovina will also be home to the regional disaster preparedness and prevention initiative secretariat  taking strong regional ownership of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe initiative. The representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina will play a lead role in the regional arms control verification and implementation assistance centre in Zagreb.  Bosnia and Herzegovina is pursuing active regional cooperation in fighting organized crime. We cooperate actively with the Southeast Europe Cooperative Initiative Centre for Combating Transborder Crime in Bucharest. It was through more efficient regional cooperation  electronic identity databases and efficient border control that Bosnia and Herzegovina was able to reduce the number of illegal immigrants  as well as all forms of cross-border criminal activity.  We are developing cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna on the detection and prevention of radioactive substance transportation and proliferation on Bosnia and Herzegovina territory. Bosnia and Herzegovina is building relationships with neighbouring countries on the basis of equality  complete independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. Bosnia and Herzegovina and its neighbours are aware that complete development can be achieved only by joining a united Europe. That goal will be achieved by pursuing the development of all aspects of good relations with neighbouring countries  the democratization of the entire region  and acceptance of general European standards.   Bosnia and Herzegovina believes in non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries  and thus that the solution for Kosovo is to be reached through dialogue among the interested parties. Bosnia and Herzegovina supports dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina and is eager to help find a solution acceptable to both sides within regional initiatives. Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the efforts of the Troika Contact Group for Kosovo and hopes that a satisfying solution for the future status of Kosovo will be found. A further lengthy delay in the resolution of the status of Kosovo will certainly have a long-term negative impact on the entire Balkan region.  Bosnia and Herzegovina has also achieved significant successes in the broader international context. In late 2006  Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of the NATO Partnership for Peace. Further recognition came in May 2007  when Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of a rather significant new United Nations body — the Human Rights Council.  On 31 May 2007  Bosnia and Herzegovina became a presiding member of the Hague Code of Conduct  which has been signed by 126 United Nations Member States. My country and the other signatories of the Code  who believe in the principle of collective safety  are prepared to fight against the proliferation of ballistic missile technology. We are aware of the great danger posed by ballistic missiles in the hands of non-government entities  which could abuse them for destructive purposes anywhere in the world. Therefore  I urge all countries that have not yet signed the Hague Code of Conduct — particularly those with ballistic capacity — to accept the Code. I also wish to urge all Member States to support the relevant draft resolution proposed by my country and Portugal.  Bosnia and Herzegovina has participated and will continue to participate  to the extent possible  in the international efforts of the anti-terrorism coalition. We have also undertaken to join the anti-terrorism efforts of the European Union. The Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina has approved an anti-terrorism strategic plan for the period 2006-2009. The ongoing reform of our criminal code will result in additional anti-terrorism measures that will conform to the relevant international conventions.  Bosnia and Herzegovina supports other Member States in continuing joint efforts to strengthen respect for all human rights  including civil  economic  cultural  political  social  developmental and other rights. Bosnia and Herzegovina has agreed to serve as a sponsor of the Italian initiative aimed at a United Nations moratorium on the death penalty  to be considered by the General Assembly. Bosnia and Herzegovina has made significant progress in submitting the relevant reports to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva.  I also wish to note that Bosnia and Herzegovina  together with Jordan  has promoted the United Nations Better World Campaign for the past few years. The Campaign seeks to improve the timeliness and effectiveness of humanitarian disaster response.  Bosnian authorities continue to be committed to cooperating fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). All suspected war criminals from the territories of the former Yugoslavia must be brought to justice. To date  we have engaged in positive cooperation with the Tribunal on issues such as the processing of criminal charges  extradition  contacting the relevant authorities  access to documentation and providing appropriate working conditions for Court representatives and others in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  We are creating a legal framework and have established the War Crimes Chamber within the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina to begin processing war crimes cases. That is one of the conditions for establishing an atmosphere of mutual trust and reconciliation in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina. However  the ICTY should not conclude its work until the most notorious war criminals — in particular Bosnian Serb war leaders Radovan Karadzic  Ratko Mladic and others — are brought to justice.  Bosnia and Herzegovina supports all peace initiatives and conflict prevention activities. We support and are following very closely the Middle East Road Map  which will lead to permanent and sustainable peace in Middle East. As part of United Nations peacekeeping operations  Bosnia and Herzegovina has military observers in the Congo and Ethiopia and has contributed to the civilian police forces in the Sudan  Cyprus  Liberia and Haiti. Bosnia and Herzegovina has also sent a small demining unit to Iraq in order to help its people establish a democratic and self-sustainable country.  We are certain that  by strengthening multilateralism  the United Nations can develop effective measures to prevent armed conflict. At the same time  however  it is essential to uphold the principle of the political independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries  in accordance with the guiding principles of international law and with full respect for human rights.  Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the Middle East Road Map and the initiatives of the Quartet  which establish a basis for the beginning of a true Israeli-Palestinian dialogue that is brokered by the United States and in accordance with European Union guidelines. Bosnia and Herzegovina calls for a general  unconditional and mutual cessation of all hostilities  the release of all hostages and the launching of negotiations on a definitive two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian problem.  Bosnia and Herzegovina urges all ethnic and religious communities in Iraq to put an end to sectarian violence and to take an active role in political life. We join the rest of the international community in calling for a broad national political dialogue  emphasizing full compliance with the Geneva Conventions of 1949.  Mindful of the potentially catastrophic consequences of a deepening of the crisis related to the Iranian nuclear development programme  Bosnia and Herzegovina calls on Iran to be prepared to cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency and to engage in a dialogue with key partners.   The United Nations role in conflict resolution is crucial. However  during various international crises  particularly that in the former Yugoslavia  the Organization has failed to play the role entrusted to it by the Charter. The Iraqi crisis highlights the weaknesses of the United Nations in preventing conflict throughout the world. If the United Nations fails to shoulder its Charter responsibilities  that could lead to a number of unilateral interventions  which would have a very negative impact on international stability.  The foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is focused on long-term peacekeeping and development with a view to ensuring the safety and stability of overall development. All our international activities are based on and conform to the Charter of the United Nations  the Helsinki Final Act of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and universally accepted principles of international law.  Aware of the enormous threat to peace posed by nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  particularly in the hands of terrorists  Bosnia and Herzegovina has taken significant steps towards total control in preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We have ratified or acceded to most of the major documents in this area. Bosnia and Herzegovina is also eager to cooperate fully with other countries at the bilateral level through relevant multilateral organizations and initiatives in order to effectively fight the proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction.  Bosnia and Herzegovina has adopted a law providing for the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. As one of the countries most affected by the mine stockpiles left over from the previous conflict  Bosnia and Herzegovina is paying close attention to the implementation of the Ottawa Convention.   Bosnia and Herzegovina is an active participant in the response and prevention programmes of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. Our contributions to the fight against that disease are described in the Bosnia and Herzegovina Strategy to Prevent and Combat HIV/AIDS  2004-2009.  Bosnia and Herzegovina pays its dues on time and on a regular basis to the United Nations and all other organizations of which it is a member. We urge other countries  especially major contributors  to do likewise. I am referring in particular to the dues to the ICTY and peacekeeping operations that have not been paid in a timely manner.  Two days ago in this Hall  we had a highly constructive exchange of views on one of the most serous and potentially dangerous phenomena of our time: global warming. Once again  I should like to emphasize the crucial importance of effective and timely United Nations action on this issue. In 2000  my country ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  which entered into force in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 15 June 2007. I urge all Member States that have not yet done so to ratify the Convention without delay. "
"21",843,"BLR",62,2007,"All of us seated in this Hall witnessed the collapse almost two decades ago of a seemingly invincible international system based on the antagonism of two poles of power. It collapsed instantly. The system that ensued  based on the antagonism of one powerful pole to the rest of the world  is already splitting apart before our very eyes and creating strains that will inevitably lead to its collapse. Simple logic  which does not aspire to explain the laws of the universe  tells us that systems based on confrontation are short-lived. They are doomed. But this is not the end of history: this is a process of history. As the twenty-first century begins  systems based on antagonism and confrontation are becoming a thing of the past. The sands of time are inexorably flowing out of them. New international systems based on partnership must replace them.  Those thoughts are not a digression into the abstract. Though still split by the old paradigm of North-South confrontation and the imposed myth of confrontation between developed and developing States  and the myth of a clash of civilizations  the international community should through its actions today build a practical partnership that will lay the foundations of new systems for the world order. When we succeed in working together  we will be able to tackle the most serious problems.  Let us take the subject of terrorism. Force alone  even the most powerful and the most sophisticated  cannot overcome terrorism. Its use instead causes a further spiral of terror. We have all painfully come to realize this. Instead  we have understood the true impact of poverty  inequality  social vulnerability and illiteracy on the rise of extremism and terrorism and have taken up the fight against terrorism through joint and comprehensive efforts  and have thus started to undermine the very foundations of terrorism. The decisive role in this  in our opinion  belongs to the United Nations.  The United Nations must also reassert its leading role in the fight against such growing evils as trafficking in human beings and bring about cooperation between the countries of origin and countries of destination of modern-day slaves. Having  in 2006  taken the first steps towards coordinating the efforts of the international community in this sphere (see resolution 61/180)  the General Assembly should offer to its intergovernmental and non-governmental partners a practical vision of a global partnership in this fight. As an optimal form of such a partnership  Belarus would opt for a United Nations plan of action or strategy to counter human trafficking and other modern forms of slavery. Let us determine the optimal format for our cooperation through a thematic General Assembly debate and begin this without delay during the current session.  We are certain that it is time for our common Organization  the United Nations  to begin looking for ways  obviously based on cooperation  to deal with what is de facto the most topical problem facing humankind: the energy problem. Antagonism between suppliers and consumers of energy resources and a price race will not resolve the energy problem. Such antagonism is itself a superficial phenomenon. At the end of the day  we are all energy consumers  and this  in principle  is where we have common interests. How are we to solve this problem  given the rapid pace of growth of the world economy and the consequent rush for energy sources? It is clear that the future belongs to alternative and renewable sources of energy. This means that today the United Nations must work out practical arrangements for the transfer and distribution of alternative and renewable energy technologies on a global scale. That is a fundamental prerequisite for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.   Such practical measures should include the methods of dealing with the obvious problem that these technologies are concentrated in the hands of a small group of States. Otherwise  the pricing for these technologies tomorrow will emulate today’s exorbitant prices for traditional energy resources. If a few decades ago the international community drew on the enlightened minds of researchers and managed to decide that a future controlled fusion technology  as a perpetual source of energy  should belong to all humanity  why can the United Nations today not take a similar decision with respect to alternative and renewable sources of energy? It would probably be right to hold  during the next session of the General Assembly  informal thematic debates on technologies for alternative and renewable energy resources as the common property of humankind.  The problem of global climate change   a key topic for this year’s general debate   is becoming increasingly acute. At present  the Kyoto Protocol is the most important international instrument for addressing this issue. In 2006  with an eye to full-fledged participation in the Kyoto Protocol  Belarus became the first and so far the only country to initiate an amendment to annex-B of the Protocol. In view of the worsening problem of climate change and incorporating the wishes of our partners  we have undertaken the most stringent commitments on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region. Through joint efforts by the parties to the Kyoto Protocol  let us ensure prompt ratification of the amendment and its entry into force  thereby setting a major practical precedent by enlarging the circle of participants in the Kyoto Protocol.   The fact that Belarus takes climate change and environmental protection issues so seriously is not accidental. Like our neighbours  the Russian Federation and Ukraine  for the past two decades now Belarus has had to deal with the consequences of the deadliest man-made disaster of the twentieth century  the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Thanks to great effort and at tremendous cost the most urgent problems of providing emergency assistance to the population today have been dealt with. In the years to come we will face an equally challenging task  namely  to restore the economic potential of the affected areas and to create a viable environment for people and pollution-free production. As before  we will bear the main burden ourselves. However  we hope that the proposed proclamation by the United Nations of a decade of rehabilitation and sustainable development of Chernobyl-affected areas  which was endorsed by the 2006 Minsk Chernobyl International Conference  will have the support of the Assembly and that a new resolution of the General Assembly will officially announce the beginning of the decade of Chernobyl  thus ensuring the cooperation and solidarity of the international community.  From this rostrum much has been said about the problems of the Doha round of negotiations on international trade. There is one more aspect of this subject  the unacceptable practice of certain countries that use the process of accession to membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a convenient instrument of pressure on candidate countries. This has involved not only economic pressure  in order to receive coerced and unilateral additional benefits from WTO expansion  but also political pressure. The United Nations must take a firm stand in favour of establishing  with the participation of all interested States  fair conditions for WTO accession that take into account the trade and financial needs of the acceding countries and their genuine development needs.  Belarus rejects the use of unilateral coercive measures in international relations as an instrument of political and economic pressure on sovereign States. Such measures not only contradict the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law but breed alienation  mistrust and hostility among nations. We end up dealing with simply absurd situations when economic sanctions are imposed under the pretext of promoting workers’ rights but lead ultimately to job losses. By applying increasingly unilateral coercive measures of economic pressure  including extraterritorially  the well-known world centre of power has assumed de facto the rights of the United Nations Security Council. We have all witnessed this during the current general debate in the General Assembly.  We wish to draw the attention of the General Assembly to a particular aspect  the abuse by the United States of the right to be the world reserve currency manager and its deliberate creation of obstacles to the lawful economic activity of legitimate companies and banks from countries that are not deemed acceptable by the United States. This is a wake-up call for the entire international community. By designating States at will as acceptable or unacceptable  as good or bad  the United States is creating an atmosphere that suppresses dissent and diversity in international relations. That not only brings ideology and politicking into international relations but is an act of confrontation with each and every one who dares to have an independent opinion or who has the courage to pursue an independent foreign policy. The majority in this hall are member States of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). They are non-aligned to confrontation. Five decades ago the creation of the Movement was a protest against confrontation and a global response to the global challenge of confrontation. Today it is within our power to stop confrontation and to reject the solutions that it seeks to impose. Tomorrow belongs to positive ideas and actions and to interaction and cooperation for peace in the common interest of the entire international community. "
"22",878,"BLZ",62,2007,"For more than 20 years we have been talking about rising atmospheric temperatures  the depletion of the ozone layer  rising sea levels and the impending inundation of low-lying coastal areas. Now that the climate change debate has finally become the rage  those of us who see the change and worry about the inevitable must unfortunately still contend with entrenched special interests who  despite the overwhelming evidence now available  continue to argue otherwise.  We are focusing our general debate on climate change  and it is the hope of my delegation that this will lead to more decisive action by all Member States so that we can begin to make the changes we believe are necessary for us to reverse the trends which so far continue to lead us down a destructive path.  We already agree that negotiations on action to tackle climate change should be conducted within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We subscribe to the principle that each of us has a role to play. Those who are the largest polluters must reverse these trends. Those who are not among the largest polluters must take the necessary measures aimed at mitigation  as well as adaptation methods  to help in reversing those trends.  Developed countries must recognize the special needs of the most vulnerable  in order to support our efforts towards sustainable development and to assist us to make our communities more adaptable to change. We must develop the capacity to take action. We must adopt more sustainable practices. For that to occur we must take specific action to limit greenhouse gas emissions. It is not enough to say that we will reduce harmful emissions. We have been saying that since Rio; we must do it.  The European Union commitment on climate change is important politically  but we need to move beyond symbolism to action. Other developed countries and regions  as well as emerging economies  must take substantial steps towards mitigation and develop and share the technologies which result in low-carbon or no-carbon economies.  In Belize  the symbiosis between our ecology and our economy is evident. Agricultural production  fishing  mineral extraction and hydrocarbon exploration as well as tourism are all subject to the caprices of the climate. Must we also be subjected to an uneven playing field in the arena of international trade  which is fast reaching the crisis level? To mix metaphors  sometimes a rising tide can swamp vulnerable boats.  The international community must keep development in perspective in the current climate change debate  since  as has been said before  economic development better enables countries to tackle climate change. Our focus on the urgency of the current situation should not  however  detract from the equally urgent if not dire situation of the development agenda  resulting from complex factors including climate change and the failure of the international economic system to reinvent itself.  At the heart of the crisis is a fundamental distrust  and no place is this more evident than in the Doha Development Round. Doha doled out harsh consequences for developing countries  particularly those that are commodity and preference dependent. We ask the question: Is there is a serious commitment to the survival of the multilateral trading system? If the answer is no  we can expect to see even more bilateral and regional arrangements  resulting in a movement away from the idea that together we are better at solving our common problems.  The discussions on climate change and the larger development debate exhibit the need for an effective  legitimate multilateral system that is fair and balanced and that operates in a transparent and inclusive manner. Responsible leadership that adheres to the basic principles of justice and the rule of law is even more critical to achieving that system and maintaining its integrity.  It is in this spirit of respect for law and justice and of the desire for equity and for the preservation of human rights that we continue to struggle with the decision of this body to exclude any true debate over the inclusion of the right of the 23 million people of Taiwan to representation in this institution. The desire of the people of Taiwan is not only to take part in the deliberations of this institution but  indeed  to be engaged on the critical issues facing the international community. We remain steadfast in our support for their aspirations and will continue to advocate for their representation  as well as that of the Saharawi people  who lack a voice in our United Nations.  We continue to monitor the situation in the Middle East with great concern. The question of Palestine remains the crux of the conflicts in the region. In that regard  it is high time that we realized the vision of two States  Palestine and Israel  living side by side in peace and security. We join those who expect that the international meeting to be held in the near future will yield results substantial enough to translate that vision into reality.  The United Nations remains the key institution to facilitate cooperation and build global solidarity to solve our pressing economic  social and political problems. Its effectiveness has been challenged. The United Nations and its Member States have responded to this challenge by embarking on a comprehensive reform process to overhaul the system and to ensure that it is better equipped to meet contemporary global demands.   We applaud reform that has been achieved in peacebuilding  human rights and humanitarian assistance and encourage the United Nations to monitor these developments for their effectiveness and their compliance with their mandates and with the Charter of the United Nations. Belize continues to support comprehensive reform of the Security Council. In particular  we agree with other Member States which have called for a more results-oriented debate during the sixty-second session.  Building trust requires a return to basics. To advance development  we must return to the basic principle of equity. In international peace and security  we must return to the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and the rule of law.  In the matter of climate change  that greatest challenge to our civilization  we must look to science to make those arguments which will diminish the sceptics. And we must return to the basic principles enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Let us give meaning to the moment. Let us get to work. "
"23",925,"BOL",62,2007,"This is the second time I have addressed the Assembly in my 20 months as President. I come here to share our experiences with the Presidents of the many countries of our world. I wish to take this opportunity to say how pleased I am at the election of a new Secretary-General  who will be leading the international Organization for the good of humankind  and above all  for the good of the abandoned and the dispossessed. For that reason  I wish to briefly comment on my own country.   For the first time in Bolivian history  the groups most forgotten  despised  hated and reviled throughout the history of Bolivia — we indigenous peoples — have assumed the leadership of our country to change our beloved Bolivia — to make political and economic changes  to reshape and re-establish our country  orienting it towards searching for unity  respecting our differences and respecting our identity so that we can work together to resolve our economic and social problems.   In this brief period  I have felt and seen that it will be difficult and will mean fighting for the equality and justice of peoples  of all of us who live in the homeland. But at the same time  we shall do so with a great deal of strength  because the popular movement  the indigenous movement and the intellectuals and even the business and professional communities  have taken a chance on their land and their people  and are striving peacefully for democratization  ensuring a cultural revolution in my country.   But sometimes it is more important to regain our natural resources. I very much regret to say that in my country  during the neoliberal regimes  natural resources and State-owned enterprises were privatized under the pretext of capitalization. In fact  they decapitalized the country  claiming that private enterprise would be the solution for unemployment and corruption. We actually saw an increase in unemployment and in corruption. Just a few years ago  Bolivia was considered to be the world's runner-up of corruption  but now I am delighted to see that international organizations have said that there has been a great decrease in corruption in Bolivia. We want to eradicate it.   I want members to know that in 2005  before I became President of the Republic  Bolivia received only $300 million in revenue from hydrocarbons. That was a time when hydrocarbons  oil and natural gas were privatized  when they were given to the transnationals. Now that we have changed the oil laws and nationalized and recovered these very important natural resources  Bolivia will receive more than $2 billion in revenue this year.   For that reason  Bolivia wants to share its experience with all leaders and with all nations where natural resources have been privatized. It is important  with the strength of the people  to recover these natural resources so that they can benefit the people and the nation. Of course  I completely understand that companies have the right to recover the economic resources that they have invested. They have a right to profit  but not like in the past when all they were concerned with was plundering our natural resources.   The most important thing in all of this is that we have begun to decolonize Bolivia  both internally and externally. I say internally because my country previously had masters. If we look back at our history  there were masters that were descended from the viceroys  religious groups and the oligarchy. They ruled and the people were powerless. Now we are building up the power of the people so that the people are sovereign  not groups of families  and so that we  the peoples  have the right to decide on our future.   That is the best kind of democracy we can implement  because it does not mean merely accepting certain policies or being subjugated by masters or bosses in my country. When I say that we are decolonizing externally as well  I mean that right now  there are no ambassadors in my country who change or appoint ministers. Before  unfortunately  United States ambassadors changed and appointed ministers. That is over. Thus  we have begun to decolonize our country.   Once  policies were imposed on us by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. That is over too. I would like to share a little story about our country that I remember clearly. In 2003  the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund told our leadership to choose between a gasoline tax and an income tax to avoid a deficit. The Government decided to put a tax on workers' wages. In two days more than 15 people died in Bolivia because of clashes among Bolivians.  Now let me say that last year  without income taxes  without gasoline taxes  Bolivia had a surplus thanks to the return of a natural resource  hydrocarbons  that is so important for my country.   That is why I say that we have begun external decolonization. We are gathering the proposals and initiatives of our peoples organized in civic and trade union forums  in particular people who have economic problems. They have the wisdom to propose initiatives and solutions from their own neighbourhoods and from their own trade unions. That is my experience  and so I think it is important to create people's power. Let social forces take the decisions  and let the leaders follow the wishes of the people. In that way we can resolve our problems.   Over the past few days I have listened to some very encouraging statements  but also some that were rather disappointing. They spoke  for example  of global warming and of climate change  and I know that many countries are victims of these natural phenomena. But I cannot understand why so many lives are lost to floods  interventionism  war and hunger? It seems that economic models are not going to solve the problems of humankind. I am all the more convinced of that after having heard many of those statements and the experiences that have been shared by world leaders. Concentrating capital in the hands of the few is not a solution to the problems of humankind. Having the wealth of the world in the hands of the few does not solve the problems of human existence. Indeed  it exacerbates problems of the poor who inhabit planet Earth.   We talk of global warming and the melting of the ice  but we do not say where it comes from. I am convinced that it comes from that ill-termed globalization — or selective globalization: a globalization that does not respect plurality and that does not respect differences.   If we are to talk about globalization  first of all we must globalize the human being. I do not know how everyone here got to New York - or to the United States - but my delegation had many visa problems. Our parliamentarians could not obtain United States visas. When I arrived at the airport  I was blocked  and my ministers - my indigenous compatriots - were subjected to hours and hours of controls at the airport. Some of us  the representatives of countries  were practically threatened by our hosts  by President Bush. If that continues  perhaps we should seriously consider  as Presidents and nations  changing the site of the United Nations. I personally am not willing to come here to be the subject of investigation. I feel that the decolonization of the United Nations too should begin and that everyone should respect us  whether we are small or large  whether we have or do not have problems.   I listen to statements about glaciers melting  and they are made without addressing the underlying causes of melting and global warming. It is capitalism and the exaggerated  unrestricted form of industrialization in some countries which are creating so many problems on our continent and on planet Earth as a whole. When we organize alongside social movements to protest and condemn these unsustainable policies  these economic models that do not solve economic problems  then what we get is military bases and interventions  wars  demonization  accusations of terrorism  as though peoples had no right to speak out about their needs  their rights  or to formulate new approaches to saving lives and humankind.   I therefore believe that it is important for us  as Presidents  nations or delegates  to tell the truth in all sincerity about these economic problems  which are not exclusive to Bolivia  North America or South America. When the democratic change is under way in South America - i.e. the kind of democracy that liberates and does not submit to imperialism - there are further accusations and misrepresentations. There are accusations of people being cruel dictators  such as those I heard from the lips of President Bush yesterday with respect to the President of Cuba. I wish to greet all revolutionaries  especially President Fidel  for whom I have a great deal of respect. Fidel also sends troops to many countries  but they are sent to save lives  whereas the President of the United States sends troops to end human lives. Therefore  since we here today are presidents  let us think about life  humankind  how to save planet Earth and the question of climate change  which is a subject of ongoing debate throughout the world.  I am convinced that it is not possible for basic services to remain private enterprises. Fortunately  thanks to the foreign ministries of the Americas  water has been recognized as a human right. If water is a human right  it is important that it should become a public utility  instead of a private business. It is important that energy should now also be a human right. I hope that we can all ensure that energy is a human right. If energy is a human right  then it will never again be a private business. It must be a public utility so as to meet the needs of our people.   I cannot understand how we can continue  under the guise of hegemony or of concentrating capital in a few hands  to do damage to humankind  to affect the poor and to marginalize other needy sectors. I feel we are making statements here in order to change these economic policies that have done  and continue to do  so much damage and that are leading humankind down the path to genocide.   I still fail to understand why some countries are involved in an arms race. I cannot accept war. In Bolivia we are discussing  as a social and political endeavour  how a new political constitution could lead us to renounce war. I am convinced that war is the industry of death and that the arms race is one more industry that complements the industry of death. In this new millennium  how can countries and presidents keep thinking in terms of interventionism  authoritarianism and arrogance on the part of some countries towards other countries  and not think about humankind?  I believe that we must work together to save planet Earth. That is the most important thing  if we want to save life and humankind.   Yesterday  too  I heard  and tried to comprehend  statements about biofuels and agrofuels. I do not understand how we can make use of agricultural products or food when it comes to cars. I cannot accept that that is what the products of the earth should be for. I believe that food should be for human beings and that soil should be for life. Are we really going to divert our land and food resources to provide for automobiles because of a gasoline or diesel shortage? Two days ago  I said that if we are really talking about life  then let us give up luxury. It is important to give up luxury. We cannot continue to accumulate garbage  we cannot continue to think about just a few families instead of thinking about all of humankind. I think we have profound differences  when we talk about these matters of life and about our national majorities.   I want to take this opportunity to express thanks for the support received from everyone  with the exception of four Governments  for the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We feel very gratified. The peoples of the Americas have waited for over 500 years for their rights to be recognized. We are part of a culture of patience. I wish to say that the fact that we now have this Declaration does not mean that we will act vindictively towards others. Indigenous people are not vengeful. We are part of the culture of dialogue and  most fundamentally  part of the culture of life.   I want to ask the United Nations to convene very soon a United Nations world summit of indigenous peoples to compile data on different cultural experiences. We are compiling data on our experiences in Bolivia through a programme called “Living Well”. To live better  one must sometimes exploit. To live better  one must sometimes rob. To live better  one must sometimes discriminate. To live better  one must sometimes plunder. But to live well means to live in community  collectively. This does not just apply to living among human beings. It also means living well in harmony with Mother Earth. The earth  for the indigenous movement  is something sacred. Mother Earth is our very life  it is Pacha Mama  as we say in our languages. Mother Earth cannot be turned into merchandise. Mother Earth cannot be turned into a business. If we talk about global warming  if we protest and fight global warming  let us remember that we are talking about Mother Earth. Since Mother Earth gives us life  we need to review our policies  but we also need to pay attention to what has been stated by our indigenous movement.   We have lived in communities  collectively. What is being debated is collectivism and community against capitalism. Let us continue to debate  to reclaim these ways of life in order to defend life and to save humankind.  I also want to take a moment to say that this new millennium must be the millennium of life  equality and justice  of respecting our identities and upholding human dignity. That is why we are talking about changing economic models  those systems that do harm to mankind. But if we want to make changes  then it is important for us to change ourselves first. Let us not be selfish  individualistic  greedy  ambitious or sectarian in our attitudes  concerning ourselves with just a few families instead of with the entire family on Mother Earth. So as presidents  as representatives of our different nations  we are talking about changing ourselves first  with a view to also changing economic models in a quest for equality and justice. During my 20 months as President  I have learned that I must work with the people and listen to their needs. There will always be groups who do not wish to lose their privileges  but those are ill-gotten privileges or privileges that enable them to use the State for family business rather than thinking of the families of others.   I have learned  during my 20 months as President  how wonderful it would have been to work for the homeland and not for money  how wonderful it would have been to work for those abandoned by the peoples  how wonderful it would have been to work together with people who do not have many economic problems but who cherish their homeland and want to work for it in solidarity and with a sense of complementarity.   I would also like to say that  as members know  we have a historic problem with our sister republic of Chile on the subject of the sea. We have now succeeded in laying the foundations of a certain trust between us: trust between our peoples  our Governments and our Presidents  through peoples' diplomacy. It is our hope that these historic claims can be worked on and resolved  within the framework of complementarity  because neighbouring countries  Latin American countries and the countries of the world need to work in a complementary way if we  want to resolve the problems of our peoples and nations. Complementarity is very important  and that is why we want to continue to work for humankind.   In conclusion  as sometimes the red light on the rostrum makes one nervous  but never mind - I would like to say that I hope we can keep learning from events of this kind  in which so many participate. These are the best universities we have. But let us speak clearly and sincerely. Let us not falsify the truth  when we talk only about the effects of humankind's problems and not their causes. In that context  I want to say that it is important to change our economic models and eradicate capitalism.  "
"24",972,"BRA",62,2007,"I congratulate the Secretary-General on his assumption of such a high office within the international system. I welcome his decision to encourage high-level debate on the extremely grave issue of climate change. It is most appropriate that that discussion take place here at the United Nations.   Let us not delude ourselves. If the groundwork of global development is not rebuilt  the risks of unprecedented environmental and human catastrophe will grow. We must overcome the apparently pragmatic and sophisticated notion   which is actually anachronistic  predatory and senseless   that profits and wealth can grow forever  at any cost. There are prices that humanity cannot afford to pay at the risk of destroying the material and spiritual foundations of our collective existence   at the risk of self-destruction. The preservation of life must prevail over mindless greed.  The world will not correct its irresponsible relationship with nature  however  until we change the way development relates to social justice. If we want to salvage our common heritage  a new and more balanced distribution of wealth is needed  both internationally and within each country. Social equity is our best weapon against the planet’s degradation. Each one of us must do our part. It is unacceptable that the cost of the irresponsibility of a privileged few be shouldered by the dispossessed of the Earth.  The most highly industrialized countries can and must set the example. Full compliance with their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol is indispensable. That is not enough  however. We need to set more ambitious goals for 2012 onwards and we must take strong action to ensure universal accession to the Protocol. Developing countries must also help in combating climate change. We need clear national strategies to hold Governments accountable to their peoples.  Brazil will soon launch its own national plan to combat climate change. The Amazon forest is one of the areas most vulnerable to global warming  but the threats cover all continents. They range from greater desertification to the outright disappearance of territories or even of entire countries lost to rising sea levels. Brazil has undertaken major efforts to minimize the impact of climate change. Suffice it to say that  in recent years  we have halved the rate of deforestation in the Amazon region.  Results like that should come as no surprise. Brazil will under no circumstance abdicate either its sovereignty or its responsibilities in the Amazon. Our recent achievements derive from an increasing presence of the Brazilian State in the region  fostering sustainable development with economic  social  educational and cultural benefits for its more than 20 million inhabitants.  I am convinced that our experience can enrich similar endeavours in other countries. In Nairobi  Brazil proposed the adoption of economic and financial incentives to reduce deforestation on a global scale. We must also increase South-South cooperation while promoting innovative modalities of joint action with developed countries. That is how we can materialize the principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities.  It is very important to adopt an integrated political approach to the environmental agenda as a whole. Brazil hosted the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development   the Earth Summit. We need to review what has been achieved since then  and set a new course of action. I therefore propose that we hold a new Conference  in 2012  the “Rio +20” Conference to be hosted by Brazil.  We will not overcome the terrible impacts of climate change until humanity changes its patterns of energy production and consumption. The world urgently needs to develop a new energy matrix in which bio-fuels will play a vital role. Bio-fuels significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With its increased and more efficient use of ethanol  Brazil has kept 644 million tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted into the atmosphere over the past 30 years.  Bio-fuels can be much more than a clean-energy alternative. Ethanol and bio-diesel can open up excellent opportunities for over 100 poor and developing countries in Latin America  Asia and  especially  Africa. They can enhance energy autonomy  without costly investments. They can create jobs and income and promote family farming. They can help balance trade deficits by reducing imports and generating surplus exportable crops.  Brazil’s experience over three decades has shown that bio-fuel production does not affect food security. Sugarcane crops cover just 1 per cent of the country’s arable land  and yields continue to rise. People do not go hungry around the world for lack of food  but rather for lack of income  which afflicts almost 1 billion men  women and children.  It is entirely possible to combine bio-fuels with environmental protection and food production. We will ensure that bio-fuel production complies with all social and environmental guarantees. Our Government has decided to implement a complete agro-ecological zoning of the country in order to identify farmland best suited to producing bio-fuels. Brazilian bio-fuels will reach the world market with a seal of assurance for their social  labour and environmental quality.  In 2008  Brazil is set to host an international conference on bio-fuels that will lay the foundations for wide-ranging global cooperation. I hereby invite all countries to participate.  Sustainable development is not just an environmental issue; it is also a social challenge. We are making Brazil less unequal and more dynamic. The country is growing again  creating jobs and distributing income. This time  opportunities are being created for all. We are paying off a centuries-old social debt  while at the same time investing heavily in quality education  science and technology.   We have honoured our commitment to “zero hunger” by sweeping away that scourge from the lives of over 45 million people. We achieved the first Millennium Development Goal 10 years ahead of schedule  cutting extreme poverty in our country by more than half. Fighting hunger and poverty should be the concern of all peoples. A global society held back by growing income disparities is simply not viable. There will be no lasting peace if we do not progressively reduce inequality.  In 2004  we launched the global Action against Hunger and Poverty. Early results are encouraging  particularly the creation of the International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID). UNITAID has already achieved 45-per-cent price cuts in drugs used against AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis for the poorest countries of Africa. The time has come for us to give it a new push. We cannot allow ideas that so mobilized our countries to fade because of bureaucratic inertia.  However  the final defeat of poverty demands more than international solidarity. It depends above all on new economic relations that no longer penalize poor countries. The Doha Round of the World Trade Organization should promote a true pact for development by adopting fair and balanced rules for international trade. Farm subsidies that make the rich richer and the poor poorer are no longer acceptable. We cannot accept agricultural protectionism that perpetuates dependency and underdevelopment. Brazil will spare no effort for a successful conclusion of those negotiations  which must  above all  benefit the poorest countries.  Building a new international order is no rhetorical turn of phrase; it is a matter of common sense. Brazil is proud of its contribution to South American integration  particularly through the Common Market of the South. We are working to bring together peoples and regions. We seek to enhance political dialogue and economic links with the Arab world  Africa and Asia  and we do so without sacrificing our traditional partners. Brazil has set up an innovative cooperation mechanism with India and South Africa. Together we are working on specific projects to help in various countries  including Haiti and Guinea-Bissau.  We all agree on the need for increased participation by developing countries in the major international decision-making bodies  in particular the Security Council. The time has come to move from words to action. We appreciate recent proposals by President Sarkozy to reform the Security Council  with the inclusion of developing nations. A review of decision-making processes within international financial institutions is also required.  The United Nations is our best tool to deal with today’s international challenges. It is through multilateral diplomacy that we find the way to fostering peace and development. Brazil’s role alongside other Latin America and Caribbean nations in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti highlights our efforts to strengthen multilateral institutions. In Haiti  we are showing that peace and stability are built with democracy and social development.  Walking into this building  representatives to the United Nations can admire a work of art that Brazil presented to the United Nations 50 years ago. I am referring to the murals that portray war and peace painted by a great Brazilian artist  Cândido Portinari. The suffering so expressively portrayed in the mural depicting war brings to mind the United Nations crucial responsibility in containing the risk of armed conflict. The second mural reminds us that peace is much more than the absence of war. It evokes well-being  health and harmonious coexistence with nature. It calls for social justice  freedom and overcoming the scourges of hunger and poverty. It is not by mere chance that those who enter the building face the mural portraying war  while those who leave see the mural depicting peace. The artist’s message is simple but powerful: transforming suffering into hope  and war into peace  is the essence of the United Nations mission. Brazil will continue to work to realize those high expectations. "
"25",1016,"BRB",62,2007,"It is my pleasure to join with the preceding speakers in congratulating you on your election to preside over the sixty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Barbados delegation extends its appreciation to your predecessor  Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her leadership of the sixty-first session and also takes the opportunity to offer its formal welcome to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.  Since its independence in 1966  Barbados has been actively participating in the formulation of international policy on a number of issues of universal concern and promoting the centrality of the United Nations in the global development debate. We are proud to have made our contribution to the critical negotiating processes on the development agenda. Much work  however  needs to be done.  Permit me to use this occasion to identify those outstanding areas to which Barbados accords outstanding importance and where we consider that urgent results-oriented action must be taken by the international community. I refer specifically to the effective and comprehensive implementation of the global partnership for development as set out in the Millennium Declaration  the Monterrey Consensus  the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation  the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius International Strategy; the provision of stable  predictable and adequate financial resources for the implementation of development commitments; the creation of a more enabling international environment that would facilitate the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by a majority of developing countries  particularly the most vulnerable among them; the recognition by the international community of the importance of providing continued support for the needs of middle-income developing countries; the implementation of existing global agreements on climate change as well as the early adoption of an ambitious and comprehensive post-Kyoto agreement; the protection and sustainable management of the Caribbean Sea; the successful conclusion of the Doha round of trade negotiations  with development as a central component of its outcome; the promotion of international cooperation on tax matters; the need for United Nations reinforcement of its commitment to assist all Member States in their efforts to combat the problems associated with the trafficking in and trans-shipment of illegal drugs  as well as the consequent increase in violent crime; and  finally  the need for progress on Security Council reform and for sustained emphasis on revitalizing the Economic and Social Council.  The gap between promises and implementation continues to frustrate our achievement of the full range of internationally agreed development goals. The level of international cooperation and resources committed by development partners has been woefully inadequate. Small island developing States  for example  have had  to date  to assume the majority portion of the implementation burden of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy  despite the fact that these goals were determined by the consensus of the entire international community. Similarly  the needs of middle-income developing countries were not adequately addressed through the Monterrey Consensus on Financing for Development  and they continue to be deprived of the vital development support they require to complete the transition. Next year’s Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development must seek to redress this situation.  There remain only eight years before we reach our target date of 2015 for the achievement of the MDGs. We must identify effective strategies to transform Member States’ political commitment to the MDGs into results-oriented  concrete action. We must forge strategic partnerships  not only within and across national borders that encompass varying levels of development and economic prosperity  but also among the private sector  the public sector and civil society.  It can no longer be denied that climate change is an alarming phenomenon that requires focused attention and urgent and decisive global action by the international community. I warmly commend the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his initiative to convene the high-level event on climate change on  24 September. The presence of so large a number of heads of State and Government at that important session is a clear indication that the grave dimensions of the problem have been recognized and the need for bold political leadership fully understood.  If we continue to delay action  we will be judged harshly  and deservedly so  for callously placing the inheritance of future generations in greater jeopardy. For today  we may have choices; tomorrow  they will not.  Barbados is a small  low-lying island State  highly dependent on its coastal and marine environment for its economic activity. For its people  the stakes could not be higher. Climate change not only represents the most serious challenge to our sustainable development  it also threatens our very survival. Prime Minister Arthur of Barbados said at the 24 September meeting that there exists no reason   scientific nor political   for delaying an immediate response to this global crisis.  Barbados and other members of the Caribbean Community have taken steps  at the national and regional levels  to develop and implement climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies and plans  largely from our own resources. However  the most effective unilateral adaptation strategies will be futile in the absence of decisive global action to reduce harmful greenhouse gases emissions and to address climate change in a comprehensive manner. Our leaders have underscored the imperative of collective action to address climate change  with the United Nations at the centre of the search for lasting solutions to that problem. In December  our negotiators in Bali must seize this moment in time.  The international community has yet to complete the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations  with an outcome that has development at its core. While trade liberalization can assist in that process  much more is required if sustainable economic development is to be achieved in the developing world. We firmly believe in a multilateral process  which will not only cater to the aspirations of the more developed countries  but will also address the needs of developing countries  especially those with small  vulnerable economies such as ours. I urge the international community to proceed with the multilateral trade negotiations with a view to reaching a successful and mutually beneficial outcome.  Barbados and the other countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) are neither major suppliers of nor demand markets for illicit drugs. Yet  because of our geographical position and external factors that are largely beyond our control  we find ourselves affected by the illicit trafficking in drugs  small arms and light weapons and their constant companion  transnational organized crime. As small countries with limited resources and severe vulnerabilities  we depend on international cooperation to counter those threats. The presence of the Caribbean Regional Office of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Barbados  which served a total of 29 States and territories and provided significant technical assistance  was extremely important to the Caribbean region.  We are deeply concerned about the decision taken unilaterally in Vienna to close that Office  and we are not at all convinced that it will make our region safer from these very real threats. On the contrary  the studies published earlier this year by the UNODC and the World Bank  on drugs  crime and development in Central America and the Caribbean  clearly demonstrate the need for an enhanced international effort in the region. It is our sincere hope that this unfortunate decision will be reversed as a matter of urgency and that the United Nations will once again engage the Caribbean region  through the reopening of the Regional Office in Barbados.  The issue of reform of the Security Council has been under consideration by the General Assembly for several years. Member States have expressed their views  and group positions have been formulated  but firm decisions have eluded us. It is now time for political compromise in the negotiation of an acceptable solution. Barbados will continue to participate actively in this process.  Gender equity and the empowerment of women are critical to development at both the national and international levels. There is a need to improve the way in which gender is treated within the context of the United Nations. It is crucial that the proposal to establish a new gender architecture be further discussed at the intergovernmental level and that all concerns be addressed and taken into consideration before a final decision is made. Any new structure must give due prominence not only to normative and advocacy issues  but also to issues of development  operational activities and adequate resources.  The deepening of the regional integration process is critical to the ability of CARICOM countries to respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by changes in the global community. Having established the Single Market in 2006  our efforts are now focused on mechanisms to bring the Single Economy into effect through a process of phased implementation. The Single Economy will facilitate further integration of our production and financial sectors  the coordination of our economic sectoral policies  the convergence of macroeconomic policies  the building of a regional capital market and the harmonization of monetary and fiscal policies.  Functional cooperation has been a central theme of the Caribbean Community since its inception. We believe that  as small nations with so much in common  our best means of advancement lies in sharing our resources  experience and expertise to address mutual concerns. Health  education and  more recently  security are our foremost areas of resource pooling and research. Our region has the distinction of being one of the first to have eradicated polio and smallpox. A fortnight ago  the region convened its first summit to specifically address chronic non-communicable diseases  which have become the major causes of morbidity and mortality.  A stable  peaceful and prosperous Haiti is essential for the effective functioning of the Caribbean Community to which it belongs. There is a continuing urgent need for substantial support from the international community to assist Haiti in consolidating and strengthening the commendable progress that it has made to date. A prime requirement is the further extension by the Security Council of the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti to include a focus on peacebuilding  judicial reform  institutional support for the provision of basic services  and border management. We must directly address the humanitarian and socio-economic needs of Haiti if the majority of the population is to be lifted out of poverty and if the underlying preconditions for threats to peace and security in the country are to be removed.  This year  many countries around the world  including Barbados  commemorated the two-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The horrors of the slave trade   particularly the notorious middle passage   were of such huge scale and intensity that it can truly be considered one of the earliest crimes against humanity. That experience must never be repeated.  To bring closure to the criminal activity that was racial slavery  we also need to bring equity to the emancipation process. Addressing the controversial issue of reparations is essential to the attainment of those objectives. This is not the first time that a discussion on reparations has taken place and that decisions have been made. During the nineteenth century  Europeans accepted and enforced multiple forms of reparations.  Delivering the Wilberforce Lecture in the United Kingdom earlier this year  Prime Minister Arthur proposed the establishment of a William Wilberforce educational fund. Barbados encourages all those countries that participated in and benefited from this iniquitous practice to support that important initiative. In so doing  they will be paying tribute to the courage and the moral convictions of all those who campaigned tirelessly for the end of the slave trade and of slavery  and at the same time they will be supporting the continuous evolutionary experiment in human relations represented by the ethnic pluralism of Caribbean societies.  In international affairs  a multilateral approach is the best means for countries to fully and effectively address the world’s most pressing problems. It is our collective responsibility to make sure that this Organization  the epicentre of multilateralism  is reformed and revitalized to make it more accountable   a transparent and effective instrument in the service of the development efforts of all its Members.  Development is the key to sustainable international peace and security. In our quest to guarantee the primacy of development on the global agenda  we must make certain that the United Nations is sufficiently well funded to meet the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable among us  to support the aspirations of middle-income developing countries and to facilitate the transition to developed-country status of those who are poised to make that transition. The disproportionate allocation of regular budget resources away from the development agenda must be reversed without further delay.  There can no longer be a deficit in the world’s development performance. We must all demonstrate the political will necessary to ensure that. It is a task from which we are not at liberty to abstain.

"26",1048,"BRN",62,2007,"May I offer my congratulations to you  Mr. President  your Government and people on your election. I would also like to offer my thanks to your predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her leadership of the General Assembly over the past year. I also offer my congratulations to the Secretary-General on the progress he has made during the past nine months. His first report (A/62/1) is very encouraging  and we welcome his response to the new challenges we are all facing. I also wish to thank our United Nations representatives  workers and volunteers throughout the world who are undertaking very hard tasks which are often extremely dangerous. We thank them for their professional dedication. This is especially so in many parts of the Middle East. Here I offer once more our continued strong support for all the efforts being made by the United Nations to find a solution to the suffering of the Palestinian people. In doing so we reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Palestine in their efforts to find a just and lasting solution to problems that have been going on for almost 60 years.   My last word of thanks  Mr. President  is to you personally. We were most encouraged by your acceptance speech and your plan for the future. We were pleased to hear you express strong support for multilateral solutions to world problems. We certainly agree on the need for the United Nations to strengthen its central position in the multilateral system. Most of all  we are very happy with the idea of a lasting consensus among Member States  the private sector  non-governmental organizations and civil society. We are especially pleased that civil societies were included. That means giving ordinary people a place in the consensus. That is why we found the statement so encouraging. Nevertheless  it has set a very serious challenge to the United Nations. It is most important that our people gain the understanding that comes from knowledge  experience and expertise. Our theme of climate change at this session shows this very clearly.  The many discussions we have had this week have taught us that all modern problems are extremely complicated. It has also shown us how important it is to gain a full understanding of these difficulties. If our people are to gain such understanding  it will come from having universal good education  good health and strong social services. This will come only when all countries have reached the United Nations Millennium Goals. So it is more urgent than ever that these Goals be reached on time. They cover all aspects of modern life   political  social  cultural  and  perhaps above all today  economic and commercial. As such they provide a way for people to understand modern problems well  take a full part in the consensus and help to find a solution.   I say this because we are now at the critical halfway point that we set seven years ago in planning the Millennium Development Goals. The discussion we have had all week on climate change shows how vital the next seven years will be. In my own country we have only just started to realize how difficult the subject is. It is like security and sustainable development and energy. These are all new  twenty-first century problems  and they all mean that our people need to learn more and more and to learn very quickly.  We need to include the subject I have mentioned in all aspects of national development planning  and we need to share knowledge and expertise. We believe that this is more important than ever. This is because by exchanging views and information on climate change this week we have also learned another new lesson  which teaches us that when it comes to modern twenty-first century problems we are all in them together. That is what your consensus  Mr. President  means. It recognizes that we all have an important contribution to make   if we work together. That is why we very much value the partnership you have proposed. We hope it will result in our people becoming far more than just receivers of solutions. We hope it will start to make them one of the most important agents in finding solutions. We feel you have begun your term of office  Mr. President  by inviting us all to share a modern platform on which we can all work well. We are very pleased to join you and your consensus for the sixty-second session of the General Assembly  and we wish you much success in broadening and strengthening it during the coming year. "
"27",1089,"BTN",62,2007,"I offer my delegation’s congratulations to the President for his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session and assure him of our support and cooperation. My delegation would also like to convey our appreciation to his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for the able manner in which she guided the work of the Assembly at the sixty-first session. We also convey our appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for the excellent leadership he provides to our Organization.   We are gratified that climate change and the Millennium Development Goals are among the top priorities of this session’s presidency. The irony of climate change is that its worst impact will be on the developing world  particularly small and island developing countries  who are least responsible for the problem. As complex as the issue is  climate change is inextricably linked to development and the debate engenders issues of equity  fairness and the right of countries to grow economically. The challenges of climate change must  therefore  be addressed within the framework of sustainable development bearing in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.  Bhutan has two major concerns about climate change. First is the potential adverse impact on agriculture  which is the mainstay of 79 per cent of our population. Second  more serious and immediate  is the rate at which Himalayan glaciers are receding. Bhutan has approximately 3 000 glacial lakes  of which 24 have been identified as potentially dangerous. Floods caused by glacial lake outbursts have caused devastation in the past  and future outbursts will be far worse. Our capacity to carry out research  monitor developments  forecast outbursts and take mitigation measures is severely constrained by a lack of scientific  technical and financial resources.  In the Millennium Declaration of 2000  world leaders undertook to channel the fruits of globalization to benefit all people and lift one sixth of humanity from extreme poverty. At the midpoint between the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the target date of 2015  reports  including the 2007 Millennium Development Goals Report  provide a mixed picture at best. The Secretary-General has rightly said that the world does not need new promises to achieve the MDGs. What is needed is urgent and concerted action by political leaders and stakeholders to meet  in their entirety  the commitments made in the Millennium Declaration and in the Monterrey Consensus adopted at the 2002 International Conference on Financing for Development and at the 2005 World Summit.  The 2006 midterm comprehensive global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 revealed that the least developed countries were unlikely to achieve all the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action  and therefore the MDGs  if trends continued. It is the moral and political imperative of the international community to help the least developed countries through strong supportive global programmes  measures and policies. However  one year later  the situation remains largely unchanged.  Geographical constraints present enormous challenges to landlocked developing countries. Bhutan is working closely with the group of landlocked developing countries to address those challenges through the cooperation of transit countries and the international community. The needs of the landlocked countries are well-documented and there is a road map for global partnership set out in the Almaty Programme of Action.  Bhutan has made tremendous socio-economic progress during the past 45 years. However  there are many hurdles to overcome before we can stand on our own feet and be self-reliant. We are determined to achieve the cherished goal of self-reliance at the earliest time possible. Until then  we will have to rely on external assistance and support. Here  I would like to record my country’s appreciation to bilateral and multilateral donors.  We hope that under the leadership of the President the Assembly will undertake results-oriented intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform in order to bring that issue to its logical conclusion. As we have stated before  Bhutan supports India  Japan and their G4 group partners for permanent membership. We also support Africa’s claim for permanent seats.  My country has as much interest in the work of the Security Council as others and would like to see it adapt to current demands and realities. Since becoming a Member in 1971  my country has served in a number of important bodies of the United Nations  but not in the Security Council. We are confident of our capacity to contribute directly to the work of the Council. Bhutan therefore announced in 1999 its candidature for a non-permanent seat for the period 2013-2014. If realized  Bhutan would gain entry into the Council after four decades in the United Nations. It is our sincere hope that the General Assembly will support Bhutan’s candidacy during the elections in 2012.  Terrorism strikes at the very foundation of humanism and cannot be justified under any circumstances. This evil must be countered through cooperation at the bilateral  regional and global levels. At the global level  greater efforts must be made to implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and conclude a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Within our region  the leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation  at their 14th summit meeting  held in New Delhi in April 2007  reaffirmed their commitment to collectively fight terrorism. That is a positive development  but more needs to be done to rid the region of this menace.  Allow me to briefly apprise this body of developments in my country. The development model pursued by Bhutan is based on the philosophy of “Gross National Happiness”  a concept conceived by our fourth King  His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  in the early 1970s. Gross National Happiness is premised on the belief that  if happiness is the ultimate desire of every individual  then it is the responsibility and purpose of the State to create conditions that enable citizens to realize this desire. We are glad that the concept of Gross National Happiness is drawing increasing global attention and we stand ready to share our experiences in this regard.  Bhutan is now set on the irreversible path to a full-fledged democratic constitutional monarchy. The people of Bhutan are looking forward to 2008  when parliamentary democracy will be introduced. Next year  Bhutan will also celebrate the formal coronation of His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and the centenary of the Wangchuck dynasty. As we stand at the threshold of these momentous developments  the people of Bhutan look to our friends and well-wishers and the global community for support and inspiration.  Before I conclude  allow me to refer to the comments made yesterday by the honourable Foreign Minister of Nepal regarding the problem of the people in camps in Nepal. As her comments were less than objective  it is important that misperceptions be clarified. It is disingenuous on her part to blame Bhutan for the lack of progress in our bilateral talks when it is widely known that disruptions to the bilateral process resulted from the political instability in her country  which were accompanied by frequent changes of Government and positions on the issue. Bhutan for its part has always been committed to the bilateral process and has not deviated from the understandings and agreements reached between the two countries.  The issue is a highly complex one that does not lend itself to conventional solutions. The genesis of the problem lies in illegal immigration. The camps were established without any screening procedures when only 304 people  claiming to be refugees from Bhutan  arrived in eastern Nepal. Screening procedures were put in place by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees only after two and a half years  and by then the number had reached its present proportion. In view of the complexity of the issue  the two Governments had agreed that the bilateral process was the only way to find a solution. In this regard  we appreciate the offer of the United States of America and other countries for third country resettlement  as it would help address that humanitarian problem.  While the Royal Government remains committed to the bilateral process  it has serious security concerns with Maoist infiltration of the camps and the formation of several radical groups  who have publicly stated their objective of destabilizing Bhutan and disrupting the country’s first parliamentary elections next year.  In conclusion  I would like to once again convey my delegation’s full support to the President and wish the General Assembly every success at it sixty-second session. Tashi delek. "
"28",1130,"BWA",62,2007,"Many speakers before me have eloquently debated the theme for this session. I am delighted that no one disputes the evidence that science presents to us concerning climate change. Today we meet in this Hall as neighbours and residents of this one planet earth. We are bound together by our common humanity and shared future. We have within us the capacity to act resolutely to save our planet  and now is the time. We cannot afford to squander any more opportunities  for tomorrow might be too late.  William Shakespeare instructs us  in his famous work  Julius Caesar  that: “There is a tide in the affairs of men  Which  taken at the flood  leads on to fortune; Omitted  all the voyage of their life  Is bound in shallows and in miseries.  On such a full sea are we now afloat;  And we must take the current when it serves   Or lose our ventures.”  We are convinced that we should focus on working together to save our planet from the increasing threat of global warming and all its attendant consequences. When we meet as the peoples of the world  we must of necessity remind ourselves of the original and higher purpose of the United Nations. Many of the global challenges we face persist  not because they are insurmountable  but because we have fallen short of the commitments and obligations freely entered into under the Charter.  We  the peoples of the earth  have the human and cultural resources and technology to end severe global poverty and disease  reverse climate change  prevent wars and alleviate human suffering. Unfortunately  substantial resources continue to be wasted on destructive endeavours rather than constructive work. We squander valuable assets in the production of weapons of war and mass destruction rather than development.  The world would be a much better place if the natural resources on this planet were exploited to feed  clothe  educate  care for the sick  prevent diseases and build communities. Young men and women should grow up looking forward to doing extraordinary things to advance the cause of economic and social progress and not spending precious time manufacturing bombs and weapons of war or planning how to kill other human beings.  It is deeply regrettable that nations continue to give higher priority to the narrow pursuit of national interests than to cooperation for the common good and mutual benefit. This emphasis on rivalry breeds injustice  intolerance  extremism and aggression. We must remind ourselves that all of us are the people of this earth and no other. We are bound by our common humanity. We must rise to the challenge of the founders of this unique universal Organization  so that we may live for our respective countries rather than die for them and together build a more just and equitable future for us all.  The United Nations has touched the lives of the vast majority of our fellow human beings. We therefore reaffirm our abiding faith in its efficacy and usefulness in addressing global issues. The Organization embodies our hope and aspirations for peace  security  respect for human rights and development; in one word  a better life for all. In that respect  the search for consensus in all aspects of United Nations reform must of necessity continue in a fair  just and balanced manner.  From 51 Member States in 1945 to 192 in 2007  the United Nations has grown in diversity and universality. It has also spread and consolidated its legitimacy and authority throughout the world. The United Nations is the centre for harmonizing the actions of nations towards the attainment of the common good. Its strength lies in its unparalleled legitimacy. Without the United Nations  States  both large and small  would encounter many formidable challenges.  It is hardly surprising  therefore  that for this Organization to live up to its mandate and to people’s expectations  it has to constantly reform itself to respond to contemporary global challenges and realities. In his inspiring and visionary statement at the closing of the San Francisco Conference 62 years ago  President Harry Truman of the United States proffered timeless wise counsel when he said  “This Charter  like our own Constitution  will be expanded and improved as time goes on. No one claims that it is now a final or a perfect instrument. It has not been poured into a fixed mold. Changing world conditions will require readjustments   but they will be the readjustments of peace and not of war.Those visionary words of one of the founding fathers of the United Nations should guide us in dealing with United Nations reform. We call upon the original signatories of the United Nations Charter and  in particular the permanent members of the Security Council  to assume greater leadership in the search for consensus and compromise on the reform of the United Nations Security Council. They should be more flexible in responding to proposals put forward on the reforms of the Security Council.  As nation States we are encouraged to build sound democratic institutions. It is imperative  therefore  that the principle of fairer  more inclusive  participatory and accountable institutions should be extended to global governance. In that respect  it should be perfectly understandable why a substantial number of Member States consider it not only necessary  but also long overdue  to increase membership of the Council in both the permanent and non-permanent categories. Today  important matters of international peace and security cannot be resolved through the monopoly of fire power. It requires greater participation and collaboration of nations   large and small.  Botswana recognizes that we cannot all be members of the Security Council. There are those among us who have the capacity to carry the daunting responsibilities of permanent membership. That is why it should be possible for us to reach consensus in making “readjustments of peace and not of war”. An all-or-nothing approach is not in our best interest. Botswana strongly supports the search for a compromise on that long-standing issue  which if left unresolved can only become an unnecessary distraction to other equally pressing priorities.  Conflicts in Africa cause the loss of hundreds of thousands of innocent lives. Many people are driven into abject poverty and exposed to disease due to the massive displacement of populations and destruction of their productive capacity. Huge amounts of resources are annually allocated to the United Nations peacekeeping budget to resolve conflicts. Even more resources are needed for the care and upkeep of refugees and displaced peoples.  The situation in Darfur continues to cause concern. Concerted efforts are needed to bring that conflict to an end. In this respect  we welcome the Security Council decision to deploy a peacekeeping mission in Darfur and call upon our brothers and sisters in the Sudan to work together to find a lasting political settlement.  Botswana is concerned about the situation in Chad and the Central African Republic. The loss of civilian lives is intolerable. We call upon Chad  the Central African Republic and other parties to those conflicts to commit to a peaceful political process to avert further loss of lives. It is clear that the resolution of conflict in that region will require closer cooperation  collaboration and partnership between and among those countries involved in conflict situations.  Following elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo we are hopeful the country is on the road to recovery. It is important for the international community to continue to support the Democratic Republic of the Congo in its post-conflict reconstruction and development efforts. The marauding lawless militias that continue to undermine the peace process should be left in no doubt that anarchy will not be tolerated.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the countries of the Great Lakes region of Africa will for the foreseeable future require the assured support and partnership of the international community  not only in peacebuilding but more importantly  in the prevention of conflicts.  Botswana acknowledges the existence of those problems  not because we consider the future of Africa to be hopeless or bleak. We do so in order to arrive at a correct diagnosis of the illnesses and hence the prescription of the right remedy.  The African Union is playing a pivotal role in the prevention  management and resolution of conflicts on the continent. While the United Nations Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  Africa should be a dependable and indispensable partner in responding expeditiously to the urgent need to end the conflicts and save lives.  The countries and peoples of Africa should recognize that the primary responsibility for durable peace and social and economic development lies with them. In that respect  we should adopt sound policies and programmes that promote economic growth and development  foreign direct investment as well as domestic investment.  Indeed we are witnessing significant economic growth in Africa. The latest International Monetary Fund projections are that  in 2007 the African economy is expected to grow by six per cent  just below the seven per cent per annum target of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development  that is necessary to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  We look to our development partners to deliver on the pledges to scale up official development assistance to Africa  effect meaningful debt relief  improve market access for African goods and services and encourage their private sectors to invest in Africa.  In the year 2000  at the dawn of the new millennium  we convened in these hallowed halls to chart a new path for the United Nations development agenda. We adopted the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals. We undertook to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger  promote gender equality as well as to combat HIV and AIDS.  The Millennium Summit followed many global conferences of the 1990s at which we made numerous commitments to combat poverty and underdevelopment. The outcomes of these United Nations conferences and summits provide a veritable template for addressing the debilitating scourge of poverty  disease  hunger and underdevelopment in the world.  Today  as we meet here seven years after the adoption of the Millennium Declaration and half way to 2015  we should pause and take serious stock of the progress made or the lack of it. It is evident that  while other regions of the world are making progress towards the realization of the MDGs  indications are that unless something is done to support Africa  the continent is unlikely to achieve any of the Goals by 2015. Statistics tell tales of a continent that is host to huge numbers of the poor and the hungry. Diseases  in particular HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  still kill many people in Africa. Those factors require an urgent response  as they create conditions that pose a threat to peace  stability and security.  In this interdependent world  the United Nations cannot realistically hope to achieve the MDGs by 2015 if one part of humanity is lagging so far behind. Something must be done to assist and support Africa. In March 2002 at Monterrey  Mexico  we recognized the imperative of global cooperation and partnership in the achievement of internationally agreed development goals. We agreed that “achieving the internationally agreed development goals  including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration  demands a new partnership between developed and developing countries” (resolution 58/130  para. 11). Let us honour our commitments and move forward.  Let me conclude by reiterating the fact that Botswana has long recognized that sustainable development has to be a nationally owned and led process that requires sound democratic institutions and prudent economic management. Adherence to those principles  coupled with the exploitation of mineral resources and donor support  enabled us to achieve rapid economic growth and some measure of development.  Continued assistance is necessary to enable us to consolidate the gains of the past few years and ensure sustainable development. In that respect  the scope of development cooperation should include private sector development  private investment and access to technology. Assistance to middle-income countries such as Botswana is crucial and in the long-term interest of the global economy. We are asking not for handouts  but for assured support  partnership and collaboration. "
"29",1173,"CAF",62,2007,"On behalf of the delegation of the Central African Republic  and in the name of our Head of State  President of the Republic François Bozizé  I extend warm and heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kerim on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are also gratified to assert that his distinctive skills will guarantee the success of our work.  I also wish to pay a warm tribute to his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain. Five decades after the presidency of Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit of India  she wisely led the work of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly  to the great satisfaction of all.  Finally  on behalf of President of the Republic and Head of State François Bozizé  allow me to address our sincere congratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his dynamism and the efficiency with which he has undertaken his work in the context of current important international issues  including the maintenance of international peace and security  climate change  human rights  and combating drugs and terrorism in all its forms  which remain pressing issues that no country in the world can address in isolation.  The conflicts afflicting the innocent civilian populations in the Middle East  the Great Lakes region and the Sudan  a neighbour of the Central African Republic  with their hosts of refugees and displaced persons  are causes of grave concern. The conflict in Darfur and the presence of rebels  armed groups and road-blockers cause the proliferation and unlawful circulation of small arms in that subregion  thus provoking widespread and continuous insecurity.   The consequences for the Central African Republic often take the shape of recurrent crises that chronically undermine the economic fabric and aggravate the poverty of our people by creating hazardous and precarious living conditions. All of this leads to the breakdown of the social fabric  the loss of civic spirit and  ultimately  the failure of confidence in their institutions and  especially  in justice.   We applaud the adoption of Security Council resolution 1778 (2007) on the deployment of the hybrid multidimensional force to the borders of the Central African Republic  Chad and the Sudan. We should like to see it accompanied  however  by genuine support for the reinforcement of institutional capacities in the Central African Republic. In that regard  we thank and praise France for its courageous decision and effective participation in that peacekeeping force.  During the fifteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development  held in New York from 30 April to 11 May 2007  whose chosen theme was turning commitments into action and working together in partnership  participants highlighted the correlation and interdependence among the four areas of the thematic cluster: energy for sustainable development  industrial development  air pollution and climate change. The Commission’s fifteenth session also demonstrated that much significant progress remains to be achieved: advances in those sectors are minimal and still far from the objectives the international community set for itself in Rio in 1992 and in Johannesburg in 2002.  In order to meet these challenges of the environment in particular and sustainable development in general  a partnership endeavour  supported by sufficient resources  is absolutely essential in order to allow developing countries  in particular in Africa  the Caribbean and the South Pacific  to implement these commitments  especially since those regions  and particularly Africa  while bearing but little responsibility for the advent of this phenomenon  are more vulnerable to the risks associated with climate change.  By choosing climate change as a central topic of this General Assembly session and organizing the high-level dialogue “The future in our hands: Addressing the leadership challenge of climate change”  the Assembly President has pinpointed the growing concern associated with global warming for a country such as ours  the Central African Republic. Indeed  the problems associated with climate change now lie at the core of international debates. The moment has thus arrived to transform good intentions into concrete actions.  For its part  the Central African Republic hopes that during the Bali Climate Change Conference this December the wealthy countries will at last honour their commitments in the area of technology transfer and will provide assistance to strengthening the national and regional structures required for effective action to combat climate change. I would like to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General for the interest he has shown in these problems and for his initiative of appointing three special envoys in the area of climate change.  Allow me to present the specific case of my country  the Central African Republic  which spans three climatic zones  with great diversity in its ecosystem  from dense humid forest in the south  to the pre-Sahelian area in the north.   This central position at the crossroads of different African ecosystems   from the Sudan-Sahelian areas in the north to the dense humid forest in the south   gives it great ecological potential. It has many assets: rich and fertile soil  mineral and forest wealth  diversified fauna and varied agriculture  with the latter being the country’s economic base.  The Central African Republic understands the wealth of its natural resources  but also the threats involved. That is why we have built environmental concerns into the constitution of our country  notably in its preamble and its article 9 where the collective consciousness is called upon to respect the principle of good environmental governance.   Despite these resources  the economic reality of the country shows that the Central African Republic is among the least developed countries  where the population lives on less than a dollar a day. In recent years  the rate of economic growth has fallen below the average predictions. Structurally  the country comes up against many obstacles in its development efforts. For instance  its domestic market is tiny  and it is isolated domestically and externally because of its distance from maritime ports. The economic situation may be summed up as follows: lack of individual income  limited State resources  inequality between men and women and the rate of illiteracy.   Our economy is largely dependent on environmental resources. Aware of the difficulties it faces  the Government has opted for regional and international cooperation by participating in many initiatives concerning the environment and sustainable forestry management  such as the Central African Forest Commission  the Network of Protected Areas of Central Africa  the Sangha Tri-National Landscape and the Congo Basin Forest Partnership.  Generally speaking  the implementation of most of these initiatives has not met expectations: the initiatives were ambitious  but the capacities for implementation and the financial resources were inadequate. The enterprises exploiting these resources impose binding environmental rules on us while the population does not reap any benefit.   We need to halt and eliminate poverty with the participation of all. Poverty creates injustice. Here I wish to cite President Sarkozy  the printed text of whose recent statement observed that justice meant the same chances for success for each poor child in the world as for each rich one. In this very Hall  President Sarkozy said:   Justice means that a developing country on which we wish to impose environmental rules  even though its inhabitants have barely enough to eat  can be helped to put such rules in place. Justice means that we cannot tap a country's resources without paying a fair price for them.   I solemnly appeal to the United Nations to concern itself with the issue of fairer distribution of wealth and of the income derived from commodities and technology. The Central African Republic is ready to open its borders to developed nations and to public and private investors in order to increase its resources. The Central African Republic applauds the great nations - France  the United States  China  Japan  Germany  Britain and Russia and certain emerging countries of the South   for their willingness to cooperate in order to slow the deterioration of the environment.  We thank the European Union and the African Development Bank for their assistance and  in particular  the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for having allowed the Central African Republic to reach the decision point under the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. We praise the actions of those international financial institutions  and we ask them to open a new chapter on the environment and the economies of poor countries.  We call on all for a continuing effort to reduce inequality between men and women  because in Africa  women are very often heads of families in the most remote regions. They play a very important role. In that way  the support of the international community in eliminating inequality will provide a solution in terms of sustainable development.   We cannot achieve a healthy environment without wiping out illiteracy. We hope that the developed countries of the South and the North will help poor countries to create the right conditions in terms of informing and training their populations in order to show them that they have an interest in preserving the environment.  Our country is rich. It wishes to exploit the wealth of its subsoil in order to protect its environment. With assistance  we can hope to bring ourselves closer to the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.   In his opening statement  the President stated  Keep your mind level. If the mind is level  the whole world will be level.  The President of the Central African Republic  Mr. Francois Bozize often teaches us about the mind ofthe spirit:  Infinite spirit is all. All is one. All is all. And all is the Universe. The Universe is calm. If we have understood this  let the world follow the example of the wise by avoiding the errors of the semi-wise who perish because of their foolishness”.  I would like to hope that this message will be favourably received by our partners  both bilateral and multilateral. "
"30",1220,"CAN",62,2007,"It is an honour for me to speak before this Assembly. The United Nations is the very embodiment of the commitment we have all made to contribute to peace and security and to create better living conditions in a greater climate of freedom. For its part  the Government I represent has never ceased strengthening its actions in the international arena. The Canadian Government is a responsible partner and a fully engaged Power. We are guided by unwavering principles. Canada’s commitment is not only linked to our interests  but above all to the values that inspire Canadians  which are freedom  the rule of law  democracy and human rights. They are the values underlying our presence in Afghanistan  in Haiti  in the Sudan and elsewhere in the world.  And they are the values and aspirations that are embodied in the Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: the inherent dignity and the rights of all members of the human family are the foundation of freedom  justice and peace. Article 1 of the Declaration says further “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”.   Those are not abstract concepts. They are real and concrete concepts with effects both immediate and profound. Promoting them is not enough. They must be protected and defended  particularly when they are under assault   in Burma  in Afghanistan  in the Sudan  in Iran and elsewhere.  In Kabul  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has confirmed the desire of the United Nations to stabilize Afghanistan. Canada has engaged its political commitment and practical capabilities to rebuild security  democracy  human rights and prosperity in that country.   Canada believes that a united international community must support efforts to rebuild Afghanistan. International organizations  including the United Nations  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the World Bank  must work towards that common goal. No one country can do that alone. To fully implement Security Council decisions  we must work in close partnership  both with the Government of Afghanistan and with our friends and allies.  To ensure a successful commitment  Canada deploys the necessary resources  as with our mission in Afghanistan. Under the terms of a clear United Nations mandate  Canada joined the coalition of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. More than 60 countries and international organizations have undertaken with us to help the democratically elected Afghan Government rebuild its country.  Canada believes that the efforts of the countries and organizations working in Afghanistan are commendable and also reflect the core principles espoused by the United Nations. The challenge is great  but the principles we are defending are greater still.  The countries assisting Afghanistan are united by a single conviction: there can be no reconstruction without security. Democracy and political stability cannot flourish in a climate of terror. Health care and education cannot be provided where anarchy prevails. Economic development is impossible when chaos is all around. Security is the crucial foundation on which everything depends  but long-term security requires sustainable investment in the country’s development; one goes hand in hand with the other.  Thanks to the assistance of Canada and the international community  Afghanistan has made progress. Afghan police officers are currently being trained  Afghan refugees are returning home and Afghan children are learning to read and write. Canada is having a real and direct impact on the lives of the Afghan people and is contributing to the achievement of the vision of the future expressed in the Afghanistan Compact which was signed in 2006. In order to make that vision a reality  it is crucial that the United Nations and the Government of Afghanistan ensure the fulfilment of the Compact. And yes  despite the incidents of intimidation and violence  the situation of the Afghan people is improving.   Last year  Prime Minister Harper emphasized here that the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan was the most important special political mission of the United Nations. The Canadian Government continues to support the leadership role of the United Nations in Afghanistan. For that reason  Canada supports having a new high-level United Nations special envoy for Afghanistan.  In the past year  our Government has demonstrated its multifaceted commitment to that mission. We have increased our development spending  our diplomatic presence and our military engagement. We welcome Security Council resolution 1776 (2007). It extends the authorization of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and calls on Member States to contribute personnel  equipment and funding. The Canadian Government encourages members of the Assembly to actively support that resolution and its implementation.  There are other challenges we must also meet. In Haiti  the Canadian Government has asked the Security Council to extend the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. That represents Canada’s most substantial development programme and its largest stabilization mission in the Americas.  In Burma  it is imperative to restore democracy and human rights. We expect the United Nations to be at the forefront of those efforts. Although we have disagreed on occasion with the decisions and processes of the United Nations Human Rights Council  the convening of a special session of the Human Rights Council on Burma is an example of the sort of activism and engagement that Canada expects of that body  especially in dealing with countries that perpetuate human rights violations.  In the Sudan  innovative peacekeeping missions are creating a security framework which will become the foundation upon which a durable peace can be built. The international community must demonstrate the political will to find new solutions. Those solutions must be aimed not only at immediately ending the horrific violations of human rights occurring daily in Darfur  but also at addressing the issues of freedom and democracy that must form the foundation for a durable peace. Canada’s substantial contribution to the Sudan continues in the form of humanitarian assistance and equipment. Of course  we condemn the intolerable attack against soldiers of the African Union force.  The scope of the challenges we must overcome to maintain our security is such that no country can hope to tackle them alone. We  the Member States  can and must show the determination and political will so that the United Nations may truly reflect the principles that its founders wanted it to embody.  Canada is and will remain a committed partner for all those who seek to work for freedom  to work for democracy and to work for human rights and the rule of law. "
"31",1235,"CHE",62,2007," At the outset  Sir  I should like to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly  and to assure you of my country’s full support during the sixty-second session.   All of us here share the hope for a more peaceful and harmonious world. At a time when civilian populations are the targets of suicide attacks and sophisticated weapons  when children are forced to become soldiers  and climate change poses a threat to the survival of our planet  how are we meeting our responsibilities? Where does the responsibility lie when millions of men and women are suffering from malnutrition and their most basic needs are not being met  when injustice is everywhere  and when the environment is being destroyed? How can we overcome those scourges assailing human beings throughout the world? How can we translate our responsibilities into action?   In attempting to answer those questions  we have to acknowledge two facts. The first is that respect for human rights  the rule of law and good governance are the prerequisites both to achieving lasting peace and security and to protecting the environment. We know now that systematic violations of human rights and flagrant deficiencies in the rule of law are often the source of conflicts. The second concerns the nature of conflicts. On the ground  battle lines are being blurred. State forces are confronting non-State armed groups. Warlords  terrorists and criminal gangs dictate the rules. Civilians rather than soldiers are the primary targets.  It is no longer possible to limit security policy to the traditional State framework. The focus now must be first and foremost on the security of the individual. Accordingly  Governments and non-State armed groups alike are called on to respect certain basic rules common to all.  If we are to achieve results  confrontation must give way to dialogue and efforts to find solutions. Negotiation  dialogue and diplomacy are the tools for achieving success. We must overcome the barriers that exist between different sectors and disciplines in the field of international relations. We must develop alliances based on shared values. That approach should enable us to find solutions by cutting across regional  ideological and cultural boundaries. The recent past has shown what can be achieved. The International Criminal Court  the Human Rights Council and the Anti-personnel Landmines Convention were all the result of broad-based coalitions of countries in all regions of the world.  However  dialogue alone will not be enough. Experience has shown that  without concrete objectives  debates between players with very different views of the world can sometimes serve to accentuate differences. In contrast  efforts to devise and implement actions that are concrete and practical make for cohabitation between different communities. It is for that reason that Switzerland supports such initiatives as the Alliance of Civilizations  along with the implementation plan proposed by the secretariat of the Alliance.  Coherent overall solutions to the crises that are currently affecting the international order cannot be implemented unless we take into account the interests of all the communities concerned. Switzerland does all it can to promote dialogue with all parties. That is particularly the case in Lebanon  where we are offering the political forces a forum in which to seek a way out of the current political crisis in the interest of long-term stability.  Recent developments in the occupied Palestinian territories have reminded us once again  with tragic intensity  of the need to respect those principles. In that regard as well  the involvement of all parties is necessary if there is to be a lasting solution.  The same can be said for the situation in Darfur. My country hopes that resolution 1769 (2007)  which for the first time envisages close cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union  will provide the inhabitants of that region with an opportunity to live in peace and to achieve reconciliation after so many years of suffering.  The situation in Myanmar is alarming. Switzerland calls on the Government of Myanmar to renounce all forms of violence against demonstrators and civilians. Switzerland favours dialogue among all the parties concerned  under the aegis of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General.  Lastly  there can be no peace or security without international justice. Switzerland supports in particular the work of the International Criminal Court. Its permanent nature and the possibility of the Security Council referring situations to the Court   as it did in the case of Darfur   gives that institution a preventive effect. For that effect to be achieved  the Court must have the full support of the international community  which must ensure that all States cooperate fully with the Court.  Human security policy also applies to environmental threats. The actions of humankind have changed the climate of the planet. Those changes are taking place on a global scale and are resulting in rising temperatures  radical changes in precipitation patterns  rising sea levels and a disruption to the balance of nature. Taken as a whole  those phenomena pose a major threat to millions of people and the places where people live  their cultures and their living conditions. The risks to security  health and development are discussed in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.   Today environmental problems are a threat to security. At the political level  they require that we act responsibly as human beings. They also require the forming of alliances to protect our natural resources. Although we have established institutions and international mechanisms to combat underdevelopment and promote peace and respect for human rights  we have not done enough with regard to the environment. It is true that we have a series of international conventions and national programmes and legislation. But environmental governance is fragmented and lacks clear objectives. We therefore need to join together to identify and implement commitments in order to better manage resources and efforts and to protect the biosphere. We also need to mobilize the United Nations system in order to respond to climate change effectively and coherently.   Switzerland therefore hopes that we will set ambitious goals for ourselves in the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol. We are ready to make a substantial contribution to that collective effort  in which the entire international community must join. Switzerland believes that  in order to have legitimacy  any future international regime to address climate change will require the participation of all countries. In our view  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changes and the Kyoto Protocol provide the most appropriate starting points for all deliberations and negotiations on climate change.  Addressing the economic  social and environmental aspects of development based on respect for human rights is both a challenge and a goal for all of us as we seek to build a world that is both freer and more secure. The international community has adopted many development goals in recent decades. However  additional efforts must still be made to ensure greater coherence in the operational system of the United Nations. With its funds  programmes and specialized agencies  the system has at its disposal an excellent network through which to ensure its presence on the ground. It also has great moral and technical legitimacy and substantial operational capacity.   Unfortunately the system remains fragmented and its transaction costs are very high   costs which are to a great extent borne by beneficiary countries themselves. Major adjustments   some of which are described in the report entitled “Delivering as One”   need to be carried out promptly in the field so that United Nations operational bodies can meet the needs of partner countries more effectively. Negotiations on the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system  which are due to begin in a few weeks  will provide the appropriate framework to determine what measures are needed   especially on the basis of the experiences of pilot countries that are applying the concept of “One United Nations”.  We stand today at the midpoint of the timetable for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Although there is no denying that progress has been made at various levels  there is still much to be done. All of us - Governments  multilateral institutions  non-governmental organizations and the private  sector   must combine our efforts across a wide front that encompasses the national  regional and international spheres. Given the upcoming high-level dialogue on financing for development  I shall limit myself merely to recalling that all of us have a common interest in improving the efficiency and the impact of development assistance and in increasing the volume of resources made available for it through official channels. We already know that results in this area can only be achieved through very considerable joint efforts by all partners concerned.  The Organization has begun a process of reform in order to better respond to global challenges. So as to strengthen the credibility and efficiency of the efforts of the United Nations  we must demonstrate our determination to fully carry out those reforms. There was real progress in the past year  including the beginning of the work of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. That illustrates the ability of the United Nations to carry out ambitious reforms in order to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century.  Switzerland is advocating for an overall improvement in the working methods of the Security Council. My country will continue its efforts to improve transparency in sanctions committees and to ensure that the addition and removal of names of persons and entities on sanctions lists are in conformity with the principles of the rule of law and human rights.  Efficient management and a better targeted use of available resources continue to pose a serious challenge for the Organization. Switzerland welcomes the determination of the Secretary-General to make the efficiency of the United Nations system one of his priorities. Given the progress made this year  but especially because of the challenges that remain  Switzerland believes that it is essential to continue the process of reform already under way. My country will therefore continue to support the efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon aimed at strengthening the United Nations and making the Organization more efficient.   If we want to move ahead  if we are determined to overcome the varied and interdependent challenges facing the globalized world of today  and if we want to free individual human beings from fear and want  we must focus on concrete objectives. To that end  let us resolve to work tirelessly to overcome our differences in the interest of the nations and peoples we represent. "
"32",1281,"CHL",62,2007,"I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside over the General Assembly. I would also like to reiterate Chile’s support for the new Secretary-General. Chile will participate in all the undertakings of the United Nations.   The international community knows about my people’s devotion to peace  justice  freedom and solidarity. It knows that this country at the southern edge of the world   despite the size of its economy and population  as well as its remoteness   has espoused the great causes of humankind. It knows about Chile’s contributions in the areas of poverty  AIDS  hunger and social cohesion. It knows that we have made substantial contributions to the promotion and observance of human rights. It knows that  even in difficult times  we have always supported international law and world peace   with dignity and determination.  Mine is a country that believes in progress and in the ability of human beings to be the authors of their own destiny and to build a better future. The world is an uncertain place when we are not able to act together. Globalization becomes unpredictable when we are not able to manage it. That is the reason we need to promote the greatest possible sustainable development with greater justice and social equity for all humankind. To that end  it is crucial that we craft agreements and strengthen multilateral institutions  all the while making progress in the areas of disarmament and non-proliferation; that we begin negotiations on the reform and expansion of the Security Council; and that we make progress in the area of management reform   on the subject of which Chile  South Africa  Sweden and Thailand have put forth a proposal for the consideration of Member States.  The major tasks facing us today will probably require more consensus-building than ever before known. How can we ensure once and for all that human rights are respected throughout the entire world? How can we halt climate change on all continents and oceans? How can we make equity and social justice for all the men and women of the world a concern of all countries? Those are the major challenges which we  as an international community  must today tackle urgently and with dedication.  Chile will vigorously promote universal respect for human rights. The establishment of a fairer and more humane international order will be possible only if we place respect for the dignity of the human person at the heart of the debate. We in Chile will work not only to improve our own practices and domestic legislation  but also to promote the strengthening of human rights  economic and social development  peace and security.  As the General Assembly is aware  human rights have been at centre of Chile’s recent history. For the citizens of my country no place is too remote nor any situation too foreign when it comes to protecting human lives and dignity.  We are pleased with the progress made in the area of norms  both internationally and nationally. We welcome the adoption and opening for signature of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance  which fills a gap in the system for protecting human rights from a crime against humanity. Chile signed that instrument and expects to ratify it in the near future. In addition  the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is in the process of being approved by our National Congress.  The new United Nations Human Rights Council should continue to promote a more effective international regime for protection  early warning and promotion in the area of human rights. We also strongly support the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  which is a very important step in the recognition of the rights of those peoples.  We shall also work to ensure that democracy and freedom are consolidated throughout the world. Democracy is a universal value  but it is a process that must be supported over time. That is why we will strongly support the United Nations Democracy Fund  so that this aspiration becomes a reality.  We are studying with concern the scientific evidence showing the devastating effects of climate change on our planet. Yesterday we were discussing its social  human and economic effects. We are glad that the world is beginning to take notice of this. It is clear that there is a serious threat to our future  and we must act now.  In Chile  for example  we have seen that the speed with which the glaciers are melting has doubled in the past ten years. Our southern zones are  in turn  experiencing a dangerous depletion of the ozone layer  jeopardizing the health of our citizens. Although we are not the ones mainly responsible for this deterioration  Chile has begun to take the necessary steps to mitigate the effects of global warming and to combine efforts so that  as a matter of urgency  solutions may be found.  As has been said here many times  there is no time to lose. The consensus that we must reach  the effort to enlist the greatest possible support  is comparable only to the international mobilization that led to the adoption of the San Francisco Charter six decades ago. If we do not act now  the future of all humanity will be endangered.  Therefore we all have the obligation to construct a new global political consensus to generate collective action capable of solving the problem in accordance with the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility and within the framework of the United Nations. All of us must contribute  but especially those who have already polluted and achieved development. We ask the developed countries to pledge technical and financial assistance to the developing countries that most need help with their efforts to combat climate change.  We strongly hope that at the meetings of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol to be held in December in Bali  progress will be made in defining the parameters of a post-2012 process. We also hope that the developed countries will make greater commitments regarding mitigation  adaptation  technology transfer and financing.  We must  however  realize that the greatest efforts by the developed countries will not suffice to halt climate change. It is also necessary that the developing countries take additional emission reduction actions in the framework of a global effort within the scope of the Convention.  I am the bearer of a message of hope as well for all nations seeking to eradicate poverty and build fairer and more inclusive societies. We still have a lot to do. Nonetheless  we can say that Chile has moved closer to becoming the country that we so deeply desire  enjoying greater prosperity and greater social justice. We are eradicating poverty. In 17 years of democracy  we have reduced poverty from 40 to 13.7 per cent. We have achieved practically all of the Millennium Development Goals. It is an ambitious objective  but one that is justified by our achievements. We are constructing a social welfare system that guarantees the social rights of Chilean men and women from the cradle to old age. We are protecting our children   girls and boys  our young people  our mothers and fathers  grandfathers and grandmothers.  We know that we are not alone in this effort. Poverty  hunger  extreme inequality and exclusion are realities that exist all over the world. With regard to the fulfilment of the Millennium Goals  progress has been made in some regions  but it is not enough. We  therefore  join in the commitment to the forthcoming launch of the Global Business Plan for Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5   that is  to greatly reduce maternal and child mortality. We do not need new commitments; we simply need to fulfil the commitments already made.  My country supports the idea of holding an international conference to focus concerted worldwide efforts on attaining the Millennium Goals  proposed by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom  so that the dream of also globalizing the prosperity that some have already achieved can come true in the not too distant future.  We can also emphasize innovative development financing mechanisms for development in order to combat inequality and promote social cohesion.  We are on the right track. As the Assembly knows well  the Presidents of Brazil  France  Chile  Spain and Germany  among others  organized an Initiative on Action Against Hunger and Poverty and their UNITAID Initiative  through which we have managed to collect hundreds of millions of dollars to finance the purchase of drugs to treat AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria; these medicines have been given to hundreds of thousands of children  mainly in Africa.  But we have to do more. Social equity and the construction of a world with a human face should become a central topic on our global agenda.  The three major causes that I have mentioned can be tackled only by common accord of the international community. Hence  the importance of our commitment to effective and efficient multilateralism  with the United Nations as its centre of gravity. We are at a complex juncture  but one of great opportunity. What we do or fail to do in the next few years will determine the future of our descendants. It all depends on us. Now is the time to act. "
"33",1327,"CHN",62,2007,"I  wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am convinced that under your able leadership  the current session will be a fruitful one. I also wish to thank Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her contribution during her presidency of the previous session.  The current international environment is highly complex. Mankind is facing both unprecedented opportunities and challenges. There is a growing trend towards peace  development and cooperation in the world. But  on the other hand  traditional and non-traditional security threats are intertwined; hotspot issues are acute; the gap between the North and South is widening; trade protectionism is resurfacing; and developing countries generally remain in a disadvantaged position. The steady trend towards economic globalization and towards a multi-polar world is fostering a new way of thinking about international relations.  In this Hall two years ago  Chinese President Hu Jintao called on mankind to build a harmonious world with lasting peace and common prosperity in the twenty-first century (see A/60/PV.5). The core message of his call is that  while recognizing the diversity of the world  differences of interests and diversity of cultures  we should harmonize interests  defuse conflicts and promote cooperation for win-win progress in a peaceful and cooperative manner.  In its 62-year history  the United Nations has played an irreplaceable role in promoting humankind’s cause of peace and development. The current session of the General Assembly should focus on promoting harmonious coexistence among countries. Resolving hotspot issues and peacefully settling international disputes through dialogue and cooperation are not only explicitly called for by the United Nations Charter. They are also the right way to uphold world peace and stability and achieve mutual benefit and a win-win situation for all.  China remains committed to seeking a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue to uphold peace and stability on the peninsula and throughout North-East Asia. The Six-Party Talks have become an important platform for the parties concerned to maintain dialogue and consultations on achieving denuclearization on the peninsula  normalizing relations between the countries concerned and building a new harmonious architecture in North-East Asia. We will continue to play a constructive role in advancing the process of the Six-Party Talks and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.  Diplomatic negotiations are the best option for resolving the Iranian nuclear issue peacefully and meeting the common interests of the international community. China opposes nuclear-weapon proliferation and stands for upholding the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and peace and stability in the Middle East. No non-proliferation effort should deviate from the goal of upholding international peace and stability. Countries should honour their due international obligations  and their right to peaceful use of nuclear energy should be fully respected. China urges the parties concerned to show flexibility and resume negotiations at an early date. China will continue to contribute its share to the peaceful settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.  The Palestine-Israel conflict is at the core of the Middle East issue. China supports the just cause of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples and the restoration of their lawful national rights  and it sincerely hopes that Arab countries and Israel will promptly end their disputes through political negotiations on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions and the principle of land for peace. China calls on Palestine to strengthen its unity and welcomes the initiative to hold an international conference on the Middle East. We hope that the Iraqi people will continue to work for national reconciliation and restore peace and stability at an early date  and that this will lead to a comprehensive  just and lasting resolution of the Middle East issue.  The trilateral dialogue and consultation among the United Nations  the African Union and the Sudanese Government on an equal footing is an effective mechanism for resolving the Darfur issue. The international community should work to sustain the current sound momentum and give full play to the role of the trilateral mechanism as the main channel. We should adhere to dual-track strategy  promote balanced progress in peacekeeping operations and the political process and seek a lasting solution to the Darfur issue through making progress in the security  political  humanitarian  economic and social areas. China is committed to a proper settlement of the Darfur issue. It has provided humanitarian assistance to Darfur on a number of occasions and will send a military engineering unit to join the peacekeeping operations there. China will continue to firmly support the peace and national reconciliation process in the Sudan and will contribute to the resolution of the Darfur issue and peace  stability and development in the Sudan.  At its current session  the General Assembly should promote the peaceful development of all countries. Poverty is a major source of disputes  and only development can eliminate poverty. Human development concerns us all. Obviously  it is impossible to build common prosperity when there is a huge chasm between the North and the South. The international community should act with a sense of urgency and redouble its efforts to deliver the Millennium Development Goals  narrow the North-South gap and  in particular  meet Africa’s special development needs. Developed countries should increase assistance  further open their domestic markets  transfer more technologies to developing countries and provide greater debt relief to them.  For their part  developing countries  on their part  should adopt development strategies and policies suited to their national conditions and boost their economic development. We should support an open  equitable and fair multilateral trade regime and oppose trade protectionism. We should work for an early  comprehensive and balanced outcome of the Doha Round negotiations and make it a development round. Reform of the international economic system should fully reflect changes in the world economy and should give developing countries more say and greater representation in the international economic system.  China gives a high priority to strengthening international cooperation on development as it develops itself. We seek coordinated and balanced global development. While a developing country itself  China has all along provided assistance to African countries and other developing countries  according to its ability  and has helped them to improve their capacity for independent and sustainable development. That is because we believe that lasting peace and the common prosperity of the world is possible only with the development of developing countries.  To help Africa attain stability  security and sustainable development is the common responsibility of the international community. China and African countries enjoy mutual political respect and equality and economic mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. They support one another and maintain close consultation in international affairs. We draw on one another’s strengths in governance to promote development. Thanks to our joint efforts  China-Africa cooperation has yielded fruitful results. Such cooperation is well received by the African countries  and it has brought great benefits to both the Chinese and African peoples. China’s cooperation with Africa facilitates Africa’s cooperation with other countries and is not targeted against any third party.  The current session of the General Assembly should be devoted to promoting harmony between man and nature. Development in the world has both advanced material progress and caused ecological imbalance and environmental pollution. To protect our common homeland is a matter of vital importance for our common future.  Climate change is an environmental issue  but ultimately it is an issue of development. It has arisen in the course of development and can be resolved only through development. We should uphold the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol and adhere to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Developed countries should face up to their responsibilities  fulfil their commitments on emissions reduction in earnest and continue to take the lead in emissions reduction after 2012. We should strengthen international cooperation on energy  resources and the environment  step up efforts to develop and introduce energy-conserving technologies  environmental protection technologies and low-carbon energy technologies  and establish reasonable mechanisms for financing and technology transfer. That will enable developing countries to gain access to and afford advanced environmental-protection technologies  enhance capacity to respond to climate change and effectively address climate change through achieving sustainable development.  China takes climate change seriously. Though its current per capita carbon dioxide emissions are less than one third of the average of developed countries  China  acting in a way that is highly responsible to mankind  has taken many effective measures to tackle climate change  including adopting a series of laws and regulations and setting the goals of reducing energy intensity and increasing forest cover. The Chinese Government has set the following targets: to reduce energy intensity and total discharge of major pollutants by about 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively and to increase the forest cover rate to 20 per cent for the period between the end of 2005 and 2010. Under its National Climate Change Programme  China will take an active part in international cooperation in climate change and contribute its share to protecting the global climate.  Advancing United Nations reform and enabling the Organization to play a more important role in maintaining world peace  promoting common development and strengthening cooperation among countries is crucial to building a harmonious world. China supports the reform of the United Nations. The reform decisions made at the high-level meeting marking the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations held in 2005 should be implemented in a comprehensive and balanced manner. Priority should be given to reform in the area of development  and the United Nations should increase its input in that area. The Human Rights Council should build on the outcome of reform in its previous phase and become a platform for dialogue and cooperation rather than an arena for political confrontation. Security Council reform should give priority to increasing the representation of developing countries and give small and medium-sized countries more opportunities to participate in decision-making. Reform proposals should be based on the widest possible consensus. China is ready to work with all other parties to turn reform into a process of strengthening consultation and dialogue and promoting solidarity and cooperation among all United Nations Member States.  China is committed to building a society of democracy  the rule of law  equity and justice  integrity and amity  vitality  stability and order  where people live in harmony with nature. To achieve that goal  China is fully implementing the outcomes of scientific thinking on development. We are working to boost social productivity and ensure people’s rights in the political  economic  cultural  social and other fields. By striving to build a harmonious society and by improving the material and cultural life of one fifth of the world’s population  China is making a true contribution to the building of a harmonious world.  China has always pursued its own development as a part of the global effort to promote the common progress of mankind. In international affairs  we are committed to the following goals: promoting participation in international affairs by all countries on an equal footing and democracy in international relations; enabling all countries to share the benefits of economic globalization and progress in science and technology for a win-win outcome; promoting exchanges and understanding among civilizations and diversity in the world; enhancing dialogue and trust among countries; and jointly tackling global issues. China unswervingly pursues a path of peaceful development and will continue to make further contributions to humankind’s cause of peace and development.  Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. We will not permit any challenge to the one-China principle and General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI). For 15 years running  since 1993  the General Assembly has rejected the inclusion of Taiwan-related issues in the agenda of the General Assembly session. This fully demonstrates that any move that runs counter to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter or attempts to distort and deny General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) will not receive any support from the United Nations Member States and is doomed to failure. We hope that the countries concerned will not allow themselves to be manipulated by the Taiwan authorities and will stop making wrong moves of this kind. The Taiwan authorities are now obstinately clinging to the separatist course of “Taiwan independence” and are trying by all means to secure a referendum on applying for membership of the United Nations under the name Taiwan. This is another dangerous step towards “de jure Taiwan independence” taken by the Chen Shui-bian authorities. If unchecked  this move will gravely endanger peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the Asia-Pacific region. The Chinese Government has always made every effort to promote with all sincerity peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and to seek peaceful reunification. However  we will never allow anyone to separate Taiwan from China in name or in any other way. We hope that the international community will continue to support China’s cause of peaceful reunification  support the Chinese people in opposing and repulsing separatist activities for “Taiwan independence” and work with us to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits and in the Asia-Pacific region.  The Olympic Games  which represent humanity’s aspiration for peace  development  cooperation and friendship  will for the first time be held in China  a country both ancient and youthful  starting on 8 August 2008. One World  One Dream   this is the theme of the Beijing Olympic Games. The 1.3 billion people in China  together with the rest of the world  are eagerly looking forward to the opening of the Games. The 2008 Olympic Games are a great event for both the Chinese people and the other peoples of the world. We are confident that with the efforts made by the Chinese people and with strong support from the international community  the 2008 Olympic Games will stand out as a highly successful event. "
"34",1361,"CIV",62,2007,"Allow me  at the outset to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on the quality of the intensive work done in such a short period of time at the head of the United Nations. I would like to congratulate him sincerely and to encourage him on his correct assessment of the world’s present problems.  This is the first time that I am taking part in the General Assembly in my seven years at the head of  Cote d'Ivoire. As members know  I am fully committed to resolving the crisis gripping my country and which has so mobilized the international community over the past five years. My presence  today  here in New York  at this rostrum  is the best proof of the climate of calm prevailing in  Cote d'Ivoire today  following the signing of the Ouagadougou political agreement  which was the outcome of direct dialogue between the State and the former rebels.  That agreement was endorsed by the Security Council which unanimously adopted resolution 1765 (2007). On behalf of the people of  Cote d'Ivoire  I wish to thank and to greet all who were involved in these positive developments: the countries members of the Security Council  the countries members of the African Union Peace and Security Council  all the countries of the African Union and the countries members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). In particular  I thank the heads of State whose personal involvement was key in resolving the crisis in  Cote d'Ivoire: President Thabo Mbeki  mediator in the Ivorian crisis appointed by the African Union  and President Blaise Compaoré  facilitator for the direct inter-Ivorian dialogue  as current Chairman of ECOWAS. We have noted that despite the international community’s efforts over the previous four years  the peace process was blocked and the country was at a standstill. That is why  on 19 December 2006  I suggested to my compatriots a way out of the crisis  focusing on five points: first  the establishment of direct dialogue with the rebels  aimed at disarmament and the reunification of the country; secondly  the removal of the Zone of Confidence; thirdly  the establishment of a national service programme; fourthly  a general amnesty; and finally  the establishment of an assistance programme for the return of persons displaced by the war. That plan was based on the experience of solutions considered up until then  but with a completely different approach  in order to ensure complete ownership of the peace process by the Ivorians themselves.  I thus took up direct dialogue with the rebels. Our discussions  through the facilitation of President Blaise Compaoré  took place in neighbouring Burkina Faso  the West African country with the closest historical and sociological ties with  Cote d'Ivoire. Those discussions led to the signing on 4 March 2007 of the Ouagadougou political agreement.  In accordance with that agreement  a new Government was established. It is headed by the former rebel leader  Mr. Guillaume Soro. With this Government  we have made considerable progress in a short period of time. An integrated command centre  bringing together soldiers from the national armed forces and from the former rebel forces  was established on 16 March 2007. Its mission is to set up a joint force entrusted with ensuring security and the free movement of individuals and goods throughout the national territory. A general amnesty order was issued on 11 April 2007. Disarmament effectively began with the 30 July 2007 “peace bonfire” in Bouaké. The redeployment of the administration and reinstatement of magistrates throughout the territory has now taken place. A plan for the return of those displaced by the war has been put in place. Mobile courts to identify members of the population and update electoral lists began yesterday  Tuesday  25 September 2007. We have made major strides towards peace since the Ouagadougou peace agreement.  The lesson I draw from this experience of direct dialogue between State authorities and the rebels has led me to invite the international community to favour local solutions in the settlement of conflicts. The United Nations in New York should make arrangements to monitor the implementation of solutions adopted by parties to a conflict.   Cote d'Ivoire will emerge from crisis. Côte d’Ivoire is emerging from crisis. Today more than ever  it needs the support of the international community to build peace and stability within its borders and in the West African subregion.  In this context  and given the climate of calm prevailing in the country  I would like the United Nations to revise downward the security rating. Phase III no longer reflects reality.   In the same spirit  with the implementation of the Ouagadougou agreement  today  Cote d'Ivoire is reunified and it is now up to the State to restore law and order throughout the territory. The agreement provides explicitly that in the redeployment of administrators  the forces of law and order are to take part in providing protection for administrative staff  as well as for the citizen population. I appeal here for the partial lifting of the weapons embargo so that the Ivorian State can carry out its task of protecting persons and goods.  Moreover  and in the present context of national reconciliation  Ivorians remain concerned that individual sanctions are still imposed on some of our compatriots. Since the Ouagadougou Agreement  those young people have put heart and soul into the search for peace. For that reason I am formally asking the United Nations  within the spirit and letter of the Ouagadougou political Agreement (S/2007/144) endorsed by resolution 1765 (2007) to lift the sanctions imposed on Charles Blé Goudé  Eugène Djué and Martin Kouakou Fofie.   Cote d'Ivoire is a sound country and our management of public finance has made it possible for the Ivorian State to function and to ensure a minimum standard of living for its people. But the ongoing crisis has ultimately led to a reduction in the financial resources available to the State and has disrupted its financial stability.   Today I am asking for assistance to help finance the actions related directly to resolving the crisis  namely: the civil service  mobile courts  general elections  the return of those displaced by war and in general  peacebuilding.  But beyond the short and medium-term actions  Cote d'Ivoire requires international aid to strengthen the basis for a more robust economic recovery in the long-term. We must rebuild and strengthen our community infrastructures. Our schools and health centres were damaged during the war. We must rebuild and strengthen our economic infrastructures   roads  railways  electric and water supply stations were severely strained by the crisis.   All observers and all actors in the crisis in Côte d’Ivoire agree that elections are the goal of the crisis resolution process in  Cote d'Ivoire. The holding of transparent  free elections that are open to all is not only a requirement under my political culture  but is  above all a democratic requirement. Elections are proof of good governance. I intend to make my country    Cote d'Ivoire   a modern State   that is  a State in which people appoint their leaders through just and transparent elections.  Democratic elections are a requirement for my country in order to modernize our political life. Elections are also required for our economic recovery. We absolutely must reorganize the coming elections in  Cote d'Ivoire and hold them successfully in order to restore confidence among economic actors in the country and abroad.   Elections are a requirement as well for stability in our country and in the subregion. We must organize elections quickly to confer political legitimacy on those who are exercising State power in order to stabilize the society in  Cote d'Ivoire and ensure economic recovery in West Africa. Finally  elections are a constitutional imperative. According to our constitution  when exceptional circumstances make it impossible to hold elections   as was the case before the country was reunified   all institutions within the Republic function solely with a view to holding elections. For that reason  the elections must be reorganized quickly so that we can move beyond this constitutional  but exceptional situation.  For all those reasons  from this rostrum at the United Nations I invite all friends of  Cote d'Ivoire throughout the world  but also and above all the politicians  both men and women  Ivorians and all peoples living in  Cote d'Ivoire to become involved in the peace process. I invite them to become fully invested in the electoral process underway and to contribute  each person according to his or her ability  to national reconciliation and to peacebuilding. "
"35",1404,"CMR",62,2007,"Let me first of all say that I am happy to see the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  represented by Ambassador Kerim  presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.  My country extends to him wishes for the greatest success in accomplishing his mission. We would like to assure him of our full cooperation. Please also allow me to pay tribute to Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain for the skill with which she conducted the work of the sixty-first session.   I would also like to welcome the presence among us of Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General of the United Nations. I congratulate him on his accession to this post of the highest prestige in our Organization. The vast experience and the qualities of a diplomat that he is known for are a guarantee of success in this lofty function. I am convinced that he will be able to work for the benefit of our Organization in continuing the efforts of his predecessor  Mr. Kofi Annan  to whom I would like once again to pay tribute.  The general debate in this Assembly is a special moment in international life. Indeed  it is an opportunity every year for heads of Member States to take stock of the world’s affairs  to exchange views in this regard and to reflect the aspirations of their nations.   The sixty-second session of the General Assembly opens this year again in a rather troubled international context. At the dawn of the twenty-first century  the challenges facing humanity are more pressing and more complex with each passing day  giving rise alternatively to hope and fears.   The first of these challenges to which I would like to refer here today has to do with peace and security. International events today highlight even more than before the paramount need to breathe new life into efforts for disarmament and non-proliferation. Nuclear proliferation is a threat  not only to international peace and security but also to the very survival of humankind. Attempts by terrorist organizations to acquire weapons of mass destruction are also indicative of the reality of this threat. Terrorism  indeed  is a particularly great danger to the international community  a threat that we can only face through concerted and resolute global action.   It is because of this conviction that Cameroon has in the past year contributed to the adoption by the General Assembly of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Once again  I would like to salute this historic accomplishment. For the first time  Member States have decided to take up concrete political  operational and legal measures to coordinate their fight against terrorism. They have committed themselves to strengthening their capacity to react  as well as the capability of the United Nations in this regard. They have agreed to address situations that could lead to the extension of this scourge. Today  the problem is to apply this fundamental text  both in letter and spirit. My country would like to reaffirm its availability and its determination in terms of taking on commitments in this work.  In many regions around the world  peace and security continue to be seriously threatened. For years now  the unrest in the Middle East has been a serious threat to international peace and security. The evolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict causes deep concern. It is paramount that Israel and the Palestinian Authority resume a constructive dialogue. That is the only way  in the opinion of my country  to move forward toward a settlement. Cameroon is convinced that only the efforts of all concerned parties  supported by the Great Powers and based on the principle of two States   Israel and Palestine   coexisting in peace and security  will make it possible to reach a definitive  fair and just settlement to this conflict.  In Lebanon  as in Iraq  reconciliation among the various communities of these countries is the only hope for a sustainable stability.   In Africa  in spite of initiatives undertaken by the international community  there remain a number of hotbeds of tension. Please allow me to highlight some of these.   The crisis in Côte d’Ivoire seems to be reaching a turning point. We are convinced that  with the firm and sincere commitment of all parties and the support of the international community  this fraternal country will have definitively turned a particularly painful page in its history. The people of Côte d’Ivoire  we are sure  will be able to persevere in their choice of peace and national reconciliation. It is extremely important that they work together in good faith for a full and rapid implementation of the Ouagadougou peace agreement.  The situation in Somalia continues to threaten peace and security in the region. Cameroon is deeply concerned by acts of violence in Somalia. We would like to congratulate the mission of the African Union for the support that it has extended to the Transitional Federal Institutions. We are sure that the speedy deployment of the envisaged United Nations force will definitely have a positive effect on the stability in that country and on the security of the population.   The human toll of the Darfur crisis causes profound concern. It seems to us of paramount importance that all efforts be undertaken to break the tragic cycle of violence in that region. The effects of the crisis have already been deeply felt by neighbouring States and threaten to extend further. It should be understood that Cameroon welcomes the announcement of the deployment of the hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping operation in Darfur. I am convinced that this operation will make it possible to stabilize the situation in the area and save innocent lives. My country welcomes the fact that the Government of Sudan has unconditionally accepted the deployment of this mission. In our opinion  this is a decisive stage in the resolution of the crisis. At the same time  Cameroon believes it is very important to continue efforts to address the causes of the conflict  by relaunching the political process and by implementing a real programme of development in the region  specifically by ensuring access to water resources.  Cameroon follows with close attention the developments in the situation in Chad and the Central African Republic. Those fraternal countries with which we have long common borders have  for a number of years  been facing instability fomented by various insurgent groups. That situation poses a serious threat to peace and stability in those countries and to the security and well-being of their populations and triggers a true humanitarian tragedy in the region. It also causes cross-border insecurity that affects other countries in the region  including Cameroon. For that reason  my country resolutely supports the upcoming deployment of a multidimensional presence of the United Nations and the European Union on the borders of Chad  the Central African Republic and the Sudan. I wish to reiterate from this rostrum that my country is ready to cooperate fully with the United Nations in the implementation of that operation.  With regard to the Democratic Republic of the Congo we welcome the progress accomplished towards peace in terms of establishing democratic institutions in that country. The situation in the eastern part of the country continues to be a source of concern to the international community. It seems to us that seeking a solution to the crisis of the two Kivus should be based first and foremost on political and diplomatic methods corresponding to the problem at hand.  The challenges we must face in terms of peace and security are considerable. However  they must not eclipse in our minds the equally significant challenges confronting us in other areas. It seems crucial to me that every necessary effort be exerted to reach the Millennium Development Goals. This year we are reaching the midpoint of the timetable we have established for ourselves in that regard. It is very important that States live up to the commitments made  to the extent possible. The reduction in official development assistance in 2006 underlines the need for donors to try to increase the level of their aid so that the goals set for 2010 and 2015 may be reached.  Furthermore  I wish again to state the hope that the negotiations of the Doha Round are completed on schedule and ensure that the interests of the countries of the South are protected and that the globalization of trade retains its significance.  I cannot remain silent about the terrible experience of thousands of young people from Africa who  for a number of years now  have set forth at risk to their lives in their attempts to reach Europe   in their eyes the new promised land. That migration keeps increasing and is of course attributable to the difference in the level of development between the North and the South. In that regard  the countries of origin  the countries of transit and the receiving countries must intervene to seek humane solutions that take into account the underlying causes of that phenomenon. It is indeed clear that neither controls nor repatriation will offer an adequate or sustainable response to the problem.   The issue of climate change is becoming one of the most important and most urgent issues of our time  as has been recognized by all  and it is urgent that we act. The destinies of future generations depend on that. In that context I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General for his initiative in convening the High-level Event on Climate Change  which has just been concluded here.  The holding of negotiations in December 2007 in Bali  Indonesia  on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and on the post-Kyoto regime should also be a focus of our attention. Furthermore  we welcome the intention of the Tunisian Government to organize from 18 to 20 November 2007  an international conference on the effects of climate change and strategies for adaptation on the African continent and in the Mediterranean region. In that domain we should try to reach a global agreement that would be part of the United Nations Framework Convention process and which would tackle the matter of climate change in all its aspects.  The challenges we have just discussed can only be taken up on a global scale. The United Nations should be at the forefront of that struggle and for that purpose needs the active cooperation of all its Members  particularly the great Powers. But it should also constantly adapt itself to the changing realities of our time so as to be in a position to efficiently fulfil its mission.   Accordingly  Cameroon attaches the greatest importance to the reform of the United Nations. It supports a progressive  gradual reform of the current United Nations system which would take into account the changing balances in the world in recent years and the emergence of many new States. It is our intention to continue to cooperate with other Member States for a renewed United Nations  a model of modern and effective governance  in its participation in world affairs. "
"36",1448,"COD",62,2007,"Allow me to join previous speakers from this rostrum in sincerely congratulating Mr. Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly.   I also pay sincere tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless and laudable efforts to defend and promote the purposes and principles of the Organization’s Charter. His visit to our country shortly after he took office reassured us of his commitment and that of the United Nations to the Congolese people in its quest for peace  freedom and development.  The sixty-second session of the General Assembly is taking place in an international context marked by persistent violence throughout the world. The United Nations task is harder than ever; by the same token  it is more noble and inspiring than ever.   For the Democratic Republic of the Congo  this session is unlike previous sessions. It marks our rebirth as a State based on law. It also marks our return to international affairs as a credible actor and partner. Today more than in the past  my country is aware of the evils of war and of poor governance  as well as of a promising future of stable institutions  legitimate authorities and peaceful coexistence among peoples. My country is thus aware of the irreplaceable value of the United Nations. We are an example of the Organization’s successful work.   I should like to pay tribute to our bilateral and multilateral partners  and in particular to the United Nations  for their invaluable assistance. Having received so much  we believe that it is now our turn to contribute to peacekeeping operations. We look forward to playing an increasingly important role; in the meantime  we have made the modest contribution of civilian police officers now deployed in two Member States.  The path to the irreversible end of the multitude of crises that have beset my country for so many years remains strewn with obstacles. From the security perspective  we still need to finalize the process of disarmament  demobilization and reintegration  complete the creation of a national republican police force and army  and operationalize a credible justice system. Attaining that three-fold goal is an absolute priority for us.   Moreover  while stressing the political and diplomatic approach  we must do all we can  resolutely and with a heightened sense of urgency  to resolve the remaining problems of insecurity in North Kivu. Nothing can reasonably justify a situation in which Congolese continue to be the daily targets of every manner of violence and abuse from national and foreign armed groups  and in which masses of our people are displaced by war. Peace and security must rapidly and at all costs be restored to that part of our territory  and they will be.  With regard to foreign armed groups  United Nations support is crucial to their voluntary or  if need be  forced disarmament  repatriation and reintegration.   Despite such difficulties  we have in less than five years successfully met the challenge of organizing democratic elections  establishing legitimate institutions  and relaunching economic growth. Our current priority is reconstruction and development with the aim of rolling back poverty  injustice and social inequalities. It is an immense task; if we are to meet it  the resolve of our people and its aspirations to a great future will be critical  though not sufficient. The unflagging and unreserved involvement of all our diverse partners remains indispensable.   Notwithstanding certain deficiencies  the United Nations remains the conscious of humankind. Its present and future role must be seen in the context of the world’s evolution and ever-changing challenges. The future will be a time of increased competition among nations  particularly in the areas of trade  finance and research  as well as of the universal enjoyment of clean air  drinking water and natural resources   vital commodities that the ever-growing population and economies of the world are making increasingly precious and scarce.   In the face of those challenges and of the ongoing threats to international peace and security  the United Nations credibility will depend on its ability to ensure that all Member States without exception implement its decisions and that commitments they have freely entered into are effectively honoured.   In that respect  turning to the Middle East  the credibility of our Organization will always be in question so long as the Security Council fails to do all in its power to ensure  pursuant to the provisions of our Charter and the relevant resolutions  the effective establishment of two States  living side by side in peace and security.   On another subject  climate change is an undeniable reality today  an eloquent instance of the constantly changing face of collective security. Its effects  unfortunately  will be more harmful in the developing countries  particularly and unfairly in Africa. Africa contributes the least to greenhouse gas emissions and does not have the resources to deal with their terrible consequences.   Making this point is a stark reminder of the need for a responsible  equitable and unified approach to the problems of sustainable development. I therefore welcome the Secretary-General’s organization on 24 September of the high-level meeting on climate change. The meeting was an opportunity for us to devote to that crucial subject the attention it deserves and to sensitize ourselves to the consequences of the patterns of consumption that expose our world to the threat of an irreversible disaster.   The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the natural habitat of unparalleled biological diversity. Its primeval forests make Central Africa the second lung of the world. We therefore undertake to participate in the design and implementation of an effective strategy to preserve optimum conditions of life on Earth. In the interests of humankind  we are prepared to make the sacrifices required by collective responsibility. In return  we call for fair compensation to ensure that we do not jeopardize our own development.  In the face of changes on the world scene  our Organization must adjust and espouse an architecture that  while preserving universal values  makes it fit to meet increasingly diverse and growing challenges. Democracy  which today is universally recognized as the best form of Government  should not only permeate our collective action in international affairs  but should also be reflected within our Organization.  Accordingly  the Democratic Republic of the Congo welcomes the process of reforming the United Nations system to create greater coherence and effectiveness of action. We wish to stress that increased representation within the Security Council is a democratic requirement necessary to the harmonious functioning of the United Nations. The continent of Africa must be represented on a permanent basis within that important organ.   We also draw the Assembly’s attention to the fact that Security Council reform must not eclipse the need to revisit other bodies of this Organization. Their working methods should be as efficient as possible and their future interaction better defined. As to the General Assembly  its authority must be further reinforced so as to enable its President to play a pre-eminent role in the search for solutions to international problems.  With regard to the new threats and challenges looming on the horizon  I have recalled the respective commitments made by Member States under the United Nations Charter  and I have reaffirmed the commitment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to that founding text of our Organization. I have also drawn the Assembly’s attention to the various scourges that characterize the international context and to the threats relating to climate change. I have thereby stressed the need for us to combine our efforts if we wish to enable our peoples to live in a world that enjoys the best possible living conditions  social progress and international peace and security.   Our political resolve to eradicate those scourges and our decisive  concerted action to do so will be the proof of how genuine our commitment really is to improving the state of the world. That is the only way to bolster the confidence of our peoples in our Organization. It is the only way  and nothing less will do  to safeguard the legitimacy of the United Nations and to consolidate the effectiveness of its action. Let us meet that challenge together. "
"37",1495,"COG",62,2007,"As he  had to leave New York earlier than scheduled owing to pressing engagements  President Denis Sassou Nguesso has asked me to address the Assembly on his behalf in order to share with other Member States the perspectives of the Congolese Government on items on the General Assembly’s agenda at this session.  On behalf of my delegation  I wish first to thank Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain for her excellent work. I also thank the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. The five priorities that he has articulated and the road map for climate change  the drafting of which he announced at his election  represent an agenda that is in line with the objectives that have been pursued by the United Nations since the Millennium Summit of September 2000. He can rely on my delegation’s cooperation when we consider those issues.  To Mr. Ban Ki-moon  in his first experience of the General Assembly’s general debate as Secretary-General  I reaffirm my Government’s commitment to assisting him in the direction he seeks to set for our Organization. My country is sensitive to the many displays of interest in us that he has demonstrated time and time again since his election last year. Proof of that  inter alia  are the visit he made to Brazzaville in January 2007 and his choice of a son of our country  Mr. Rodolphe Adada  former Foreign Minister of the Congo  to direct the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). We are very grateful to him for that.  Following the violent crises that shook our nation in the late 1990s  the Congo has gradually found peace and stability through political dialogue and national reconciliation  which remain our ongoing objectives. The return of a number of Congolese who left the country during the civil wars is part of that positive trend. The legislative elections that have just been held peacefully are indeed the sign of a democracy at peace. That favourable dynamic needs  of course  to be encouraged  assisted and supported by the international community.  Despite enormous losses in human life and considerable material damage  at the end of the civil war the Congo was not considered to be a country in a post-conflict situation. We had to undertake at our own expense the vast task of restoration and reconstruction. We therefore plunged resolutely into difficult negotiations with the Bretton Woods institutions to elaborate a programme of debt relief  implementation of the Millennium Development Goals   including the fight against poverty   and economic recovery. In that context  in order not to exacerbate further the daily existence of the majority of our people already living without the basic necessities  we are trying to prevent the negotiations from being an intolerable burden on them. We therefore hope to bring the negotiations to a conclusion as soon as possible so as not to delay the implementation of the necessary reforms.  The return to peace and stability has allowed my country to resume its place on the international stage. In less than three months  the Congo will end its term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. For the past 20 months  we have participated in the Council’s deliberations in a constructive spirit. We have always favoured the resolution of disputes through peaceful means and dialogue  seeking compromise and enhanced multilateralism. Our participation has strengthened our belief in the need and urgency of reform of that main organ of the United  Nations  entrusted with the maintenance of international peace and security. Our position and that of Africa is well known on that question. We have also focused on improving the Council’s working methods in order to ensure greater transparency and inclusiveness in its decision-making process.  During the presidency of the African Union assumed by Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso in 2006  the Congo had occasion to speak on behalf of a continent whose issues occupy the lion’s share of the Council’s agenda. We made the case for strengthening the partnership between the United Nations and the African Union in order to ensure that the Council’s decisions take the concerns of African countries into consideration and are thereby legitimate and viable. We called for ongoing dialogue between the Council  on the one hand  and the African Union  through its Peace and Security Council  and African States as a whole  on the other  as well as parties to conflicts.   We encouraged the international community to remain involved in the Democratic Republic of the Congo through the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  including after the elections  which clearly represented a great step forward but left unresolved the questions of peace in the East  the disarmament of armed groups  the repatriation of foreign combatants and economic reconstruction. Such developments could be facilitated in the context of the pact signed at the conclusion of the second summit of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region  which is an appropriate regional framework.  In the Côte d’Ivoire  after much uncertainty  it is comforting to note that the process engaged by the Ouagadougou agreement has opened prospects for a resolution of the crisis  which we need to encourage and assist.   The same prospects for encouraging developments are now open to Darfur following the adoption of Security Council resolution 1769 (2007). In his statement to the Council summit of 25 September  the Congolese Head of State called on the international community to seize this opportunity to act with a sense of urgency.   We must accelerate the pace of work in the following three areas  as emerged from the high-level meeting on Darfur held here in New York on 21 September. First  political dialogue is to resume on 27 October in Tripoli  where all parties must participate  bearing in mind the exceptional open-mindedness of the Sudanese Government  which has decided to observe a ceasefire once the Tripoli talks begin. Sanctions should be considered for all reticent parties. To encourage the initiative of political dialogue  which will determine any possible success for the international community’s involvement in Darfur  my Government has decided to contribute to the special Trust Fund created by the Secretary-General to that end.  Secondly  peace must be maintained via the deployment of UNAMID. The creation of the force was a most significant decision that must be implemented without delay in order to avoid any political setback and any deterioration of the situation on the ground. In that area  too  my Government has demonstrated its solidarity by deciding to dispatch a contingent  along with the military observers it sent earlier as part of the African Union Mission in Sudan. In that regard  my delegation vigorously condemns the recent attack on the African Union peacekeepers in Haskanita in southern Darfur. We ask that the perpetrators be actively sought and punished.  Thirdly  humanitarian assistance and economic recovery are more than indispensable to stabilization and a return to normalcy in Darfur. With respect to African crises  we cannot ignore the tragedy of Somalia. As we all know  Africa has committed to deploying the Africa Union Military Observer Mission in Somalia  which should be vigorously supported and ultimately relieved by a United Nations force. Somalia must not become a forgotten crisis. The Somalis themselves  however  must assume their responsibilities and make a serious commitment to an inclusive political dialogue that will lead to genuine national reconciliation.  Until the end of this month  the Congo is the President of the Economic Community of Central African States. Our subregion has always been involved in international initiatives concerning the situations in its various constituent countries. A contingent put together by some of those countries is therefore contributing to the stability of the situation in the Central African Republic. The twenty-sixth meeting of the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa  held in Yaoundé on 7 September 2007  resulted in a series of conclusions including  in particular  an appeal to the international community and the donors to help the Governments of Burundi  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Chad secure their borders and improve general security conditions; support for the multidisciplinary operation to be deployed to secure the situation in the areas of Chad and the Central African Republic bordering the Sudan   the subject of Security Council resolution 1778 (2007)  adopted on 25 September   and pursuing subregional cooperation on questions of security  including the announcement of the military exercise of a simulated peacekeeping operation  scheduled for Chad in November.   And finally  still in Yaoundé  on the margins of the meeting of the Advisory Committee  a ministerial conference on cross-border security questions in Central Africa resulted in the adoption of a statement  which amounts to a political commitment  by the States in the subregion to implement organizational  administrative  legal and technical mechanisms of cooperation in border areas. This will allow us to tackle such phenomena as uncontrolled or forced movement of populations  criminal activities of armed groups  illicit flows of small arms and light weapons and the illegal exploitation of natural resources.   My country also remains vigilant to the threats that weigh on other parts of the world and crises that shake several regions around the globe. In this spirit  we have always supported a peaceful settlement to the Middle East conflict that takes into account the Quartet’s Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative. We have also called for an international conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all countries in the region that can make a useful contribution. We therefore welcome with interest and hope the announcement of the November conference on the Middle East.   In terms of nuclear non-proliferation  we have always called for compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty in all its aspects  including the right of all countries to develop nuclear technology for civil purposes. We have always insisted on the crucial role of the International Atomic Energy Agency and on the need for a political dialogue with the countries whose nuclear programs raise questions. In this respect  we are pleased with the evolution of negotiations with North Korea  and we encourage pursuing dialogue with Iran to make sure that there is no slippage in the programme that country is developing.  My delegation is also pleased with the mobilization of the international community around a question crucial for the future of mankind: the real threat of climate change. Now  thanks to science  it has been clearly established that it is human activity that is at the origin of this scourge. We agree with the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly that the time has come to act. Therefore  we welcomed the high-level meeting held here on 24 September on this theme. The President of the Congo personally participated in that meeting to show the commitment of the countries of the Congo Basin   the world’s second ecological lung  after the Amazon Basin   in the struggle for survival of our species and safeguarding the planet overall. On the basis of a strategic plan called the convergence plan  a ten-year plan  these countries have made a commitment to national and subregional actions having to do with sustainable management of forest ecosystems in the Basin.   The awareness that we have a responsibility in this common fight has led us to cooperate with the two other great forest areas   the Amazon and in Borneo   to promote better forestry and commercial practices. The talks that these three areas held on 24 September  on the margins of the high-level meeting  have permitted our delegations to prepare for a common approach to be presented at the conference of the States parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bali this December.  Our constant commitment to peace and international security today includes many aspects. Climate change merits this special attention that this Assembly  as the world’s conscience  must give to these great challenges confronting humanity. "
"38",1542,"COL",62,2007,"Allow  me to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his election as President of the General Assembly and to wish him the greatest success in his work.  After five years in office  we come to the General Assembly once again to inform members on issues crucial to Colombian democracy.  We have rejected the dismantling of the State and refuse to enter into a statism that would wither private initiative. We have reformed 420 State entities and are determined to work to that end until the last day of our Government. We seek a more efficient State at the service of the community and not owned by political machinations  union excesses or interest groups.  We are committed to the development of an entrepreneurial society  in opposition to State or private monopolies  in a nation with a consensus centred on productivity  discipline and equity. We provide every space for private initiative with social responsibility  which must be expressed in the transparency of relations between investors and the State  in entrepreneurial solidarity with the community beyond the legal minimums  and in labour relations framed by fraternity  contrary to savage capitalism and class struggle.  In sectors such as electricity  metallurgy and health  we have encouraged participatory trade unionism  with simultaneous responsibility in the social field and entrepreneurial management  distinct from traditional entitlement organization. We have increased by 40 per cent the affiliation of workers to social security through the improved performance of the economy and our fight against evasion. In the past five years  the minimum wage has grown by 8 per cent above inflation. Our per capita income has gone from $1 851 to $3 517. After adjustment in terms of purchasing power  it has increased from $6 468 to $9 456. For the first time in decades  the Gini coefficient of income distribution has started to improve.  From the first day of my Government  with our democratic security policy we made the decision not to tolerate the murder of any Colombian and to defeat impunity. The security situation has improved substantially. In 2002  Colombia suffered 29 000 homicides  of which 196 were perpetrated against trade unionists  and we closed 2006 with a 40 per cent reduction in general violence and a 70 per cent reduction in violence against trade unionists. This year  there are 6 714 Colombians with individual protection from the State  of which almost 1 200 are workers belonging to trade unions  at a budgetary cost of almost $39 million.  In our struggle against impunity  between the budgets for 2002 and 2008 we will have increased the resources for the judicial branch and for the Attorney General’s office by 76 per cent and 78 per cent  respectively. The budget for the special unit of the Attorney General’s office devoted to cases of the murder of trade unionists has increased by 40 per cent. The unit oversees more than 300 cases prioritized by trade union movements.  The fight against impunity for the murder of unionized workers is being carried out under the guidelines of the International Labour Organization (ILO)  in agreement between Government  workers and employers. Reports on the progress made  submitted by the ILO office in Colombia  have been positive.  Allow me to affirm before the United Nations that murders and kidnappings have been the work of terrorists. First  it was the Marxist guerrillas who  in introducing their perverse scheme of a so-called combination of all forms of struggle  murdered  kidnapped and penetrated sectors of workers  students  politicians and journalists. Then came the paramilitaries  and they did the same  murdering workers and accusing them of collaborating with the guerrillas  which in reciprocity murdered those whom they believed to be friends with the paramilitaries. In certain parts of the country  the confrontation between the two guerrilla factions that still exist leads to the murder of workers.  Overcoming that scourge once and for all is an inalienable objective of our democratic security policy. In that regard  our three Government objectives are to consolidate democratic security  strengthen investor confidence  and achieve our social programme  which is more ambitious than the millennium social goals that we hope to meet before the date set by the United Nations.  With regard to democratic security  we are winning  but we have not won yet. With persistence and transparency  Colombia will overcome terrorism financed by illicit drugs. We have a long-lived  respectable and ever-deepening democracy. We are approaching the fifth electoral contest presided over by my Government  and the transparency and effectiveness of the guarantees offered to all contenders are increasingly evident. There are 86 347 registered candidates of 235 different political origins to fill 18 332 posts by direct election. This is happening in a country that  five years ago  was facing 60 000 terrorists  and where about 11 000 still remain. To fight them  we deepen democracy instead of restricting it  protect liberties instead of suppressing them  and stimulate dissent instead of silencing it. Our fight against terrorism is being observed by national and international critics  who can be in the country and say what they please without restriction.  Our democratic practice gives us the political authority to say that those who take up arms financed by illicit drugs are not insurgents against oppression but terrorists against liberty. We will not refuse to negotiate with them if they cease their violent actions  but we will not allow for negotiation to become a trap that enables the destruction of our democracy. We have achieved the demobilization of 46 000 members of different factions and we are carrying out a costly and complex reintegration process with them that requires truth  justice and redress for the victims.  Thus  I now turn to the humanitarian agreement to free kidnapped people being held by terrorists of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia   Ejército del Pueblo (FARC). Most of those were kidnapped before or during the time of the Caguan demilitarized zone  which lasted 42 months. We do not understand why FARC should ask for a demilitarized zone to release the kidnapped when it had that option for so long and did not free them. The country was without law and order for many years  and with no security  which allowed its almost complete takeover by guerrillas and paramilitaries. Citizens do not want terrorists; they plead for the exclusive presence of the State in all regions. We are open to a humanitarian agreement  but we cannot allow demilitarized zones  which are ultimately concentration camps run by terrorists  nor can we permit those who are released from prison to return to crime  since it would be an affront to the sacrifice of the country’s soldiers and police.  We have unilaterally freed 177 FARC members  as well as Rodrigo Granda  a high-ranking member of that organization  who was freed at the request of the President of France  Nicolas Sarkozy. We have given our consent for many people and institutions to be facilitators. The only answer from the terrorists has been the treacherous murder of 11 assemblymen from Valle del Cauca  who were held hostage for more than five years  and the ongoing assassinations of defenders of democracy  such as those perpetrated last Saturday  in which the victim was Julio César Marentes and Alberto Martínez Barbosa  two candidates for mayor in Villarrica and Río Blanco  Department of Tolima  and members of a political party from the Government’s coalition.  The options open for the release of kidnapping victims   including a French female citizen who is also Colombian  and three American citizens   are not options for the political positioning of terrorism. Colombia will not permit the recovery of its legitimate and democratic sovereignty to be frustrated by restoring national or international space to the murdering power of terrorism. If terrorists want to be involved in politics  they have to renounce their bloody activities and submit to the Constitution.  Recently  the Government gave its permission to Senator Piedad Córdoba  who is in the opposition to the Government  to play a role as facilitator of the humanitarian agreement. We also accepted the help of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela  who will meet shortly with representatives of FARC. President Chávez has invited some congressmen from the United States to join him at that meeting  with my Government’s support and suggestion that the American delegation be bipartisan so as to preserve a bipartisan approach in its relations with Colombia. We celebrate the positive willingness of the Government of the United States.  We have established certain reservations in order to defend our democracy’s higher interests  and we encourage both President Chávez and Senator Piedad Córdoba in their tasks because we are committed to the release of those being held hostage. The dismantling of paramilitarism  the weakening of the guerrillas  the restoration of effective guarantees for democracy beyond rhetoric  and the protection of a free press in a country where 15 journalists were once murdered in a year   this year there has been one case   are results that allow us to look the world in the eye and demand full support for our democratic security policy.  Today there is no paramilitarism. There are guerrillas and drug traffickers. The term “paramilitary” was coined to refer to private criminal organizations whose objective was to combat guerrillas. Today  the sole entity that combats guerrillas is the State  which has recovered the monopoly it should never have lost.  With the backing of the United Nations  we are striving to assist displaced persons and to restore their dignity. We have multiplied by a factor of 10 the budget to protect them. The phenomenon remains  but has shown a significant reduction.  Today  Colombians feel more confident. The investment rate has risen from 12 per cent of gross domestic product to 26 per cent. Deficit and indebtedness are moving towards a net reduction. Unemployment  which stood at around 20 per cent  is now at 11 per cent  and we are struggling to lower it to 7 per cent. We are seeking to reduce poverty  which stood at close to 40 per cent  to a level no higher than 35 per cent in 2010.   We are advancing towards the goal of achieving universal access to basic education. We have built an excellent technical training system. We have gone from 300 000 to 1.5 million families living in poverty that receive a subsidy for their children’s nutrition and education. We aim in the next three years to meet the goal of universal access to health services. We are working hard to fulfil  during the current four-year period  the target of providing 5 million microcredits to an equal number of families with scarce resources  as a basic strategy to overcome factors of exclusion. We have gone from 3.7 million to 9 million children who have benefited from our food programmes; we expect to reach 12 million in 2010. Our programme “Together”  undertaken to eliminate extreme poverty  combines a variety of social tools to cover 1.5 million families.  We reaffirm our commitment to fighting global warming. We have gone from 37 000 natural gas vehicles to nearly 300 000. We have moved forward in the construction of mass transportation systems in nine cities to reduce individual transportation. With indigenous communities  we have advanced in the construction of a series of villages that compose a barrier for the complete recovery of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Our new forest law prohibits the destruction of the rainforest and changes in land use. Colombia has 578 000 square kilometres of tropical forest  which constitutes a lung of the planet. We will soon have 80 000 forest-keeper families  who are remunerated by the State and are committed to abandoning illicit drug production and to supervising the recovery of destroyed forests. One national objective is the production of bio-fuels  for which we have 44 million hectares of savannah  which will allow greater development  initially in sugarcane and African palm  without jeopardizing food security or destroying a single square millimetre of rainforest.  I thank the United Nations system for all its support for Colombia  and I would like to highlight four areas. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has been the guarantor and supervisor of our forest-keeper families programme to protect the rainforest from the destructive threat of drug trafficking. The International Labour Organization carries out excellent work in our workers’ protection programme. We have extended the mandate of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to maintain its presence in Colombia for the remainder of my Government’s term of office. Furthermore  various United Nations entities provide valuable support in the task of assisting displaced people.  We continue working for a society without exclusion and without class hatred  in permanent constructive debate; one that looks for options  that does not stagnate in insurmountable antagonisms  that is respectful of the Democratic Constitution and guided by a long-term vision  and that sustains itself on an inclusive dialogue every day.  I thank the international community for all its support. I invite everyone to visit Colombia  to talk to our fellow countrymen and women  and to experience the collective spirit to fight for the greater happiness of future generations. Colombia should be known not through bad news  but rather through a great relationship with Colombians themselves. I reiterate the invitation to visit our country. "
"39",1582,"COM",62,2007,"Echoing  previous eminent speakers at this rostrum  on behalf of my country  the Union of the Comoros  and on my own behalf  it is a genuine pleasure to address our warm congratulations to the President on his brilliant assumption of the presidency of the sixty-second session of this Assembly. It is a pleasure likewise to address our warmest congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for the effective manner in which he has carried out his duties in this world undergoing vast change  which requires increased commitment by our Organization. May I also extend our sincere thanks to the American Government and to the leaders of this magnificent city of New York for the fine preparations that they have made to receive and welcome us here.  The situations of conflict that claim innocent victims   in the Middle East  in Darfur  in Somalia and in so many other regions where hotbeds of tension erupt   appeal to our collective conscience and call for urgent measures for calm and for the resolution of such problems. My Government endorses any action taken by the international community  particularly the African Union and the United Nations  in seeking solutions to these problems  which are a source of concern for the whole world.  The world has reason to be concerned. Fear and uncertainty have become widespread  within both developed and developing countries. Paradoxically  science and technology have never been so effective. The world has never been so rich  nor has it displayed such great profits.   Today  the countries of the South are overwhelmed by the burden of debt  civil war  insecurity  destitution  precariousness and endemic disease. Therefore  security and harmony in this world call for greater solidarity and greater humanism.  The international community should thus emphasize development assistance to help the small countries to meet environmental challenges  particularly the effects of climate change  degradation of the ecosystem and desertification. Such solidarity should also be forthcoming in combating other scourges affecting our countries  most specifically HIV/AIDS  malaria and all other diseases that decimate our peoples and impede our development.  In addition  yet another scourge besets the world  and that is terrorism  which recognizes no borders. Nor does it recognize race or religion in its unspeakable cowardice and blindness. We should do everything possible to ensure that it can no longer flourish on poverty and prosper on the weakest links of the world chain.  Also  we must ensure that fanaticism and intolerance can no longer impose their law on the world and destroy humankind. Indeed  in bolstering tolerance and respect for the right to difference and for the dignity of every people  we will avoid possible setbacks  attacks on human rights and the amalgam of terrorism and particular religions or regions. In this way  we will be successful in guaranteeing lasting peace  stability  security and development  because it would be an illusion to speak of such ideals in a world of poverty  where economic development and the  well-being of each and every individual have not yet been achieved.   Moreover  at this midpoint on the way to the deadline of 2015 set for the Millennium Development Goals  while notable progress has been achieved  full achievement of these objectives depend to a large extent  on international solidarity and respect for the various commitments entered into by the wealthiest countries.  The reform of our Organization is more necessary than ever to ensure that it is fully representative and better reflects its universal nature. Thus  Africa and all other regions of the world should be appropriately represented within the Organization in order to more effectively embody the principle of equality of States within this great concert of nations.  The President took the Chair.  Allow me to take this exceptional opportunity to present some insight into the situation in my country  the Union of the Comoros.   Since assuming the highest office  I have endeavoured  with my Government  to give effect to the commitments made to the people of the Comoros and to the international community in connection with respect for human rights  the rule of law and good governance  particularly through the restoration of a system of justice that should serve as a model  the struggle against corruption  the struggle against insalubrious housing and advancing the situation of women.  In this certainly very ambitious endeavour  I rely largely on the people of the Comoros themselves to establish at the national level the conditions necessary for the success of the mission and task I have set myself. I am also confident that international solidarity will continue to increase  to support to a small country such as ours in confronting the numerous problems that it encounters daily. Indeed  I would like to express from this rostrum our gratitude to all the countries and organizations that support us in this undertaking of building a nation in the Comoros that is peaceful and prosperous.   But I have to emphasize that there was a time not so long ago when the African continent and other regions of the world were shaken by endless coups d’état. That illegal  antidemocratic and frequently violent form of access to power plunged the countries in question into instability.   It would appear that that time is now passed  with the advent of democracy and multiparty systems. The large majority of political forces would appear to accept democratic succession through free and transparent consultation of peoples as being the only acceptable means for acceding to power.  However  another mode of violent political action continues to exist in developing countries and appears to be assuming particular importance  namely  the armed rebellions affecting many countries  including the Comoros  my country. Armed uprisings are a source of destabilization and an obstacle to development efforts. Such uprisings are frequently at the centre of political and geopolitical interests that support them  to the detriment of the best interests of the countries themselves. They benefit from the explicit or hidden support of internal or external forces which use them.  My country is not free from this phenomenon. Indeed  the former Head of the Executive of the island of Anjouan refuses to hold free and democratic elections at the end of his term. He is leading an armed uprising that has attacked the presidency of the Union  the representation of the Government of the Union in the island and the contingent of the National Development Army. The uprising jeopardizes the hopes for development of the country by causing delays in repayment of the debt of the Comoros to the international institutions and hampers the resumption of investment from abroad. It is for this reason that I state here our major concern at the political crisis that we are experiencing.  Therefore  I make a solemn and urgent appeal to the entire international community to assist us in establishing lasting stability in the Union of the Comoros by settling the problem of the uprising that continues in the autonomous island of Anjouan. Indeed  all the steps taken by the Government of the Union have encountered to date the intransigence of the rebels of Anjouan  who refuse to comply with the resolutions of the African Union and the recommendations of the international community regarding the organization of free and democratic elections in Anjouan  as occurred in the other two islands and in respect of the constitutional legality  particularly  the exercise in Anjouan of legitimate powers.  From the bottom of my heart  I would wish to thank all our bilateral and multilateral partners for their unflagging support in the search for a prompt and final solution to the crisis that we are experiencing. For all these partners  I have always demonstrated our goodwill in seeking to settle the Anjouan crisis by peaceful means because the important thing is to save national unity and preserve the people of the Comoros from anything that might damage our development efforts.  I take this opportunity also to thank the authorities of the African Development Bank and all those instrumental in providing partial debt relief to the Comoros  with a view to facilitating our economic recovery.  The Assembly will understand that the Comorian Government cannot sanction any action that would establish the Balkanization of our country. The Comorian people remember only too well the unfortunate experience regarding the sister island of Mayotte. Although the one case is a problem within the Comoros and the other a dispute with France  which is a friendly country and principal partner of the  Comoros   and I stress that fact  France is a friendly country  a friend and principal partner of the  Comoros   both situations involve the disunion of our country  and we cannot remain indifferent to them.  Over 30 years have passed since the independent nation of the Comoros was admitted to the United Nations  within its authentic borders  that is  comprised of four islands: Ngazidja  Mwali  Ndzouani and Maoré. During those 30 years  all organizations that have recognized our independence have unflaggingly supported the just claim by the Comoros of sovereignty over the island of Mayotte  a claim upheld by the successive Governments in Moroni. That is a principle that the people of the Comoros will never give up  even if the approach has varied from one administration to the next. Today  my Government would like  in a calm atmosphere  to deal with this matter with France  giving priority to dialogue and consultation. For we must together find a rapid response to the problem of the human tragedies caused by the frequent shipwrecks of makeshift boats transporting on virtually a weekly basis dozens of Comorians from the other islands who visit Mayotte to meet with their families. We must promptly together deal with the inhuman treatment inflicted on Comorians from the other islands residing in Mayotte  and we must seek to facilitate the free movement of goods and persons among all the islands of the archipelago. Lastly  we must find together a modus vivendi that reflects particularly the social  cultural  linguistic  economic  religious and historical realities that shape the life of all Comorians.   To that end  I am happy to note the convergence of views with Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy  President of the French Republic  who  during his address to this Assembly stated   “I want to say  in the name of France  that there will be no peace in the world without respect for diversity  without respect for national identities  without respect  I venture to say  for religions and beliefs  or without respect for cultures. Attachment to one’s faith  to one’s identity  to one’s language and culture  and to one's way of life  thought and belief in all that is legitimate  and profoundly human. I thus appeal to the United Nations to take on this matter by working to achieve a closer rapprochement between the two parties  with a view to a prompt settlement of the question. I truly believe that together with the French authorities we can find the ways and means to move towards a final  just and lawful solution to this problem.   In the ongoing quest for peace and freedom  I have a particular thought for those who  throughout the world  are engaged in struggle and are claiming their rights to unity and territorial integrity. Thus  from this rostrum  I would like to renew to our friend the People’s Republic of China  our commitment to a policy of a single China  single and indivisible. To our brother country the Kingdom of Morocco  I would like to reaffirm our support for its legitimate fight to recover its territorial integrity.   In conclusion  I hope that peace reigns in our world  that goodness and good faith win our hearts so that the people of the world can live in happiness and in greater solidarity than ever.   I would like to finish with a few words in Arabic.  The Israeli-Arab conflict is the source of tensions in the Middle East  and the Palestinians in the occupied Arab territories live in inhuman and tragic economic conditions because of Israeli practices. The international community must deal decisively with this situation by requiring the Israeli authorities to implement relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and decisions. Additionally  the provisions of international law  international humanitarian law and human rights must be observed. As we all know  there can be no peace in the Middle East without a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question effected by the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories that it occupied in 1967.   Without the establishment of a viable Palestinian State  with East Jerusalem with its capital  and the settlement of the question of refugees on the basis of the General Assembly resolution of 1949  the conflict will not be settled. Construction of settlements must be stopped  the separation wall must be demolished and Palestinians must be compensated for damage caused by its construction. I also invite our Palestinian brothers to renounce division and disintegration and to engage in dialogue. The international community and the United Nations must provide swift humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip  open the crossings and dismantle anything that hampers movement.  We also state our solidarity with our brothers in Lebanon  and we call for full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  the cessation of Israeli incursions into Lebanon and withdrawal from the Sheba’a Farms.   On the subject of Darfur  we give priority to the peace talks to be held in Libya on 24 October this year. We hope that all the parties will attend these talks. The international community must assume its responsibility and urge the parties to participate in those negotiations  which we hope will be final and decisive. We also hope that the African Union mission and character in Darfur will be respected and that the sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of the Sudan will be fully respected.  "
"40",1621,"CPV",62,2007,"While we  commend the United Nations for having chosen climate change as the theme for this sixty-second session of the General Assembly  at the same time we recall that many countries in the South have  in recent decades  warned the international community about this phenomenon  which is being experienced here and there through the drama of droughts and desertification. Climate change has multiple causes  some natural and others generated by human action. Therefore  the responsibilities of States and societies with respect to these changes are not equal. Nor are the impacts they have on the lives of the common citizen. Likewise  we do not have the same scientific  technological or financial means to prevent the negative effects of climate change.  At this point  I would like to say a few words about drought and desertification  which demonstrate  without a doubt  the change of climate in the West African subregion. It is needless to mention their devastating impact on the economic and social life of the populations. Unfortunately  in spite of conferences and grandiloquent conclusions and declarations  the repeated calls from the Sahel have received half-heated and inconsistent responses. In view of the profound implications of this stance for the lives of populations and States  some are depicting those responses as an abdication of responsibility on the part of the international community.  Climate change is  without any doubt  a world challenge with many dimensions and the potential to restructure economic  social and political life. Most likely  we have wasted too much time in discussion  thereby delaying global acceptance of the problem and  consequently  the formulation of strategies for adaptation and mitigation.  In brief  I would like to underline the catastrophic effects  both present and future  of climate change and more specifically  of drought and desertification on small island States. If the projections on sea level rise prove to be true  we will be facing a disaster of unimaginable proportions.  My country  Cape Verde  an archipelago of modest physical and demographic dimensions  is a small island State and has experienced drought and desertification and suffered from almost uninterrupted water shortages for more than three decades.  Indeed  Cape Verde  given its location  size  landscape and the insular and archipelagic characteristics of its territory  is a prime example of the convergence and concentration of the negative effects of climate change. Drought and desertification have an unquestionable impact on family income and the poverty rate. They also undermine Government efforts and strongly condition the mobilization and allocation of resources for development financing.  In the light of the challenges of climate change  one should recall the leading role that the United Nations has had and continues to have in mustering efforts to raise awareness about this critical problem for the future of mankind. We are convinced that the Bali conference will set new parameters based on the principle of equity  the legitimate aspirations of populations to development and the differentiated responsibilities of each and everyone.  We therefore call on the United Nations to pursue its efforts in this area and give very special attention to small island States  which have to contend with multiple fragilities and vulnerabilities. It is imperative to resume and implement the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. The community of nations cannot but acknowledge that  given their origins and their role throughout history  small island States are a “heritage of mankind”.  In spite of its structural vulnerabilities and its undeniable lack of natural resources  Cape Verde has  since independence in 1975  followed a positive and consistent development path. It is in this context that we should consider Cape Verde’s graduation or  in other words  its withdrawal from the group of least developed countries as of 2008. We are resolved to rise to the challenge of this new development stage and through audacious strategies and decisions to transform the country. We are quite aware that the main responsibility for Cape Verde’s development rests in the hands of the Cape Verdean Government and citizens. This is the spirit that has guided us in the past  and it is the spirit that will allow us to face the challenge of graduation. Nevertheless  during the transition period we hope to be able to count on strong partnership from the international community in dealing with Cape Verde’s structural fragility and any new vulnerabilities.  In this regard  I call on the United Nations and Member States to pay special attention to the declaration of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and to the report that the Government will soon deliver to the Secretary-General in accordance with the resolution on graduation which the General Assembly adopted in December 2004.  While it is true that our development strategy is open  daring and driven by the desire to create opportunities for foreign direct investment  it is no less true that today  more than ever  we need innovative aid and financing modalities that are better adjusted to the pace we want to set for Cape Verde’s development and to the imperatives of the transition. It is high time that we move from discourse to action with respect to ownership  in accordance with the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.  Allow me also briefly to recall the transborder and global nature of many modern day phenomena. I refer to climate change and  of course  to terrorism  organized crime and trafficking of all kinds. These represent a threat to human security and to the democratic rule of law  as they corrupt values  compromise development and thwart the most legitimate expectations of peoples.  We are living at a time when problems and threats are of concern to all. They are not confined to a single State or region. Nor can there be local solutions to the global threats of our era. Responses to these issues will be ineffective unless they are undertaken within a robust  balanced and fair multilateral perspective.  The United Nations is  and should continue to be  the foundation  the guarantor and the forum of multilateralism. We are strongly convinced that the United Nations must be strengthened for the sake of the future of the world and of the ideals of peace  security and development. And we are all faced with the challenge of translating the reiterated statements of the international community into coherent and consistent action. It is a question of credibility in the eyes of the world  which is watching us.  I cannot conclude without extending my greetings  congratulations and encouragement to the Secretary-General and wishing him success in guiding our common Organization towards fully attaining its founding goals and meeting the imperatives of increased efficiency  modernization and democratization in its work.  Likewise  I would like to extend warm greetings to you  Mr. President  and to assure you of our confidence that you will face the important challenges confronting the Assembly with serenity and a sense of duty.

"41",1667,"CRI",62,2007,"The  192 Member States gathered here have not yet taken the qualitative leap called for by Woodrow Wilson in 1918 for our international order not to be based on organized rivalries  but rather on an organized common peace.   We must learn to tone down our national interests. We must foster a shared sense for what is just and what is necessary. We must understand that the basic premise of collective security is that we must agree upon the threats that we face and the manner in which we must tackle them.   We must accept that collective security  in order to be legitimate  must defend international law in the abstract  without preference for some over others. Nevertheless  we continue to have an unequal commitment to international law. Some of us have accepted a multilateralism that is based on open agreements openly arrived at  whereas others refuse to yield imaginary shares of sovereignty. As long as the latter continue to understand sovereignty as the absence of obligations and responsibilities to others  multilateralism is compromised.   Cultures and viewpoints from all parts of the world gather here. They do so because they know that the solitude of unilateralism is a dead-end road. Multilateralism must  however  have preconditions. Those who want to be treated as a partner must behave as one. If not  we will never be able to live up to our promise of “never again”. The “never again” that we pronounced at the end of the First World War and the Second World War or that we asserted following the genocides in Kampuchea and Rwanda  still fails to mobilize us today to solve other situations that are just as unacceptable  just as intolerable and  on occasion  just as unimaginable.   It is not right to compromise multilateralism; it is especially wrong to do so when  through a lack of will  we affect one or more partners making a desperate appeal for help. In that regard  we welcome the fact that this General Assembly has put climate change at the top of its agenda. But how long has it taken us? We simply cannot be satisfied with a “better late than never”  when in 1987  exactly 20 years ago  President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of the Republic of the Maldives alerted us that he did not come to speak about international political issues but rather about “the death of a nation”  the death of a nation whose 1 190 islands will be virtually submerged with the rise in sea level owing to climate change. The emergency hotline must respond not only to 11 September but to all the emergencies covered by the Charter of the United Nations.   It is time to pay our debt to nature. We simply cannot continue to distort the evidence of climate change. Regardless of how inconvenient the truth may be or what our respective shares of responsibility are  the truth is here to stay. Year after year we are reminded of it with greater frequency and intensity.   In Costa Rica where the most species per square kilometre of anywhere in the world are found  we are committed to going beyond our obligations. We have adopted concrete and sustainable actions  such as setting aside 27 per cent of our national territory as preserves  the generation of energy using renewable energy sources for 98 per cent of our generating capacity  the introduction of environmental service payments and the commitment to advance towards a carbon-neutral economy by the year 2021. However  no matter how sustainable our commitment at the national level  our efforts will have less impact if they are not met by similar commitments in other parts of the world. Since climate change does not recognize borders  others with large environmental debts simply cannot continue to live in debt  as this accelerates the coming of the day of judgement.   Although we have seen some strides in international environmental governance at both the global and regional levels  we continue to be indebted to nature. The Kyoto Protocol is an incomplete instrument  not only because it has not attained universality  but also because it does not incentivize the sustainability of the primary forest and its ecosystem. In that respect  Costa Rica is working on compensatory mechanisms to avoid deforestation with different intergovernmental groups  such as the Coalition for Rainforest Nations and the Group of 11  to make sure that the post-Kyoto scheme does not exclude primary forests.   We cannot compromise on multilateralism. It is unrealistic to press others for compliance with the obligations that arise from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  while disregarding one’s own obligations. Both treaties and all of their articles are part of an intricate architecture of mutual trust that does not allow for any partial constructs. We must avoid both horizontal and vertical proliferation  promote compliance with all of the obligations that arise from those treaties and condemn every attempt to break the regime of mutual trust. We cannot allow for the proliferation of exceptions to non-proliferation.   Multilateralism is not built on a show of strength. In 2006  the world reached a record $1.2 trillion in military spending. According to the Millennium Project  with one tenth of this amount  that is  $121 billion  we would have met the targets for 2006 for all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in all countries of the world. In 2006  on average  for every dollar spent on official development assistance by the member States of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  $7.5 were spent on weapons.  Security does not come from multiplying weapons; history has proven this time and time again. Security comes from remedying injustices  easing shortages and creating opportunities so that we can have collective prosperity on par with collective security. In this regard  Costa Rica has been calling for compliance with the Charter of the United Nations  Article 26 of which commits us to promote “the maintenance of international peace and security with the least diversion for armaments of the world’s human and economic resources”. Thus says the dead letter of the Charter of the United Nations.  It is in this spirit that we have pressed for the adoption of an arms trade treaty  a legally binding instrument that codifies the existing obligations of States under international law that may apply to the arms trade. Therefore we celebrate the adoption  by a significant majority  of Assembly resolution 61/89  which allows us to re-activate this noble objective of the Charter.  It is also in this spirit that we have called for the animation of the Costa Rica Consensus  so that international donors can reward those developing countries that are making sustainable and verifiable efforts to meet the most pressing social needs  including the MDGs  while increasing social investment and reducing military spending.  Multilateralism requires a shared sense of urgency. We need to face all global threats  all global challenges in a timely fashion  not creating a world with two different speeds: one in which we need two decades to respond to the call made by President Gayoom  among others  and another in which we respond in a just a few days  with binding resolutions like Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) or 1540 (2004).  Our commitment to combat terrorism must aim at prevailing not only over the terrorists  but also over the root causes from which they draw strengthen and renewal. In this regard  it is as important to combat the manifestations of terrorism  its financial channels and physical hideouts as it is to fight the poverty and despair that provide an easy harvest for extremists. To succeed we can no longer afford to be late in dealing with the challenges of development.  Multilateralism also requires a shared sense of justice. For that  we need more States to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. As we advance towards the universality of the Statute and the acceptance of its complementary jurisdiction  we will close the gaps and loopholes by which the worst criminals in the world escape and hide.  Finally  we must have the courage to look at ourselves in the mirror  as an Organization and as Member States. We cannot permit this Organization’s foundations to be weakened by a few errors. We need to learn from our mistakes and allow space for self-criticism. We do a disservice to the credibility and the effectiveness of this Organization if  each time a difficult or inconvenient situation arises  we simply produce a report for the archives. Our scant follow-up to the reports on Srebrenica and the Oil-for-Food Programme provides two clear examples of our apparent incapacity for learning.  As Harry Truman said  referring to the convening of the San Francisco Conference  “it was important for us to make a start  no matter how imperfect”. Since 1945  this Organization has expanded and changed  improving through experience and reform  incorporating more and more cultures and views  putting into practice  with more or less success  the principles and purposes of the Charter. This Organization certainly does not have all the answers and does not possess all the resources required  for in the end  it is restrained by the lowest common denominator  that is  by ourselves  the Member States.  We have a world of reasons to persevere and prevail over the challenges we face. Neither the chronic pessimism of some nor the ungrateful egoism of others will check the slow but determined march forward of those of us who believe in multilateralism and in a future of greater shared welfare for all.

"42",1736,"CUB",62,2007,"Never before have the real dangers awaiting the human species become so evident; never before have the violations of international law become so evident  as they increasingly jeopardize international peace and security; never before have inequality and exclusion become so evident  as they impact over two thirds of the population on our planet.  Putting an end to wastefulness and to the unbridled consumerism fostered by the large corporations and the power groups of a handful of developed countries   which throw money away at the cost of poverty and the perpetuation of underdevelopment in a vast periphery of poor countries where billions of people scramble to make a living   has become a key factor for the survival of mankind. The high-level meeting of this General Assembly held only two days ago emphasized the danger posed by the accelerated global warming that is already affecting us and by its effect on climate change. Action must be taken   and quickly. The developed countries have the moral duty and the historic responsibility to set the example and spearhead the effort.  On the other hand  several of our countries  always from the South  continue to fall prey to unacceptable acts of aggression by the ever-powerful  which are essentially driven by the insatiable hunger for strategic resources. The wars of conquest and the proclamation and implementation of doctrines based on pre-emptive wars   which do not exclude the use of nuclear weapons  even against non-nuclear States   and the repeated use of pretexts such as the alleged war on terror  the supposed promotion of democracy or so-called regime change in countries that are unilaterally labelled as rogue States are today the greatest and most serious threat to peace and security in the world.  Aggression and illegal occupation of countries  military intervention contrary to international law and the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter  the bombing of civilians and torture continue to be daily practices. Under the false litany of freedom and democracy  an attempt is made to justify the pillaging of the natural resources in the third world and to control zones of increasing geo-strategic importance. That and no other is the imperial domination plan that the mightiest military superpower ever to exist intends to impose through blood and fire.  Far from behaving in international relations according to the principles of solidarity  social and international justice  equality and development for all  there is no hesitation at all in employing the practices of certifying countries  of imposing unilateral blockades and of threatening through aggression  blackmail and coercion. If a small country defends its right to independence  it is accused of being a rogue State; if a Power launches an attack against a country  it is said that it liberates them; a fighter against foreign aggression is a terrorist; an attacking soldier is a freedom fighter. That is the media war  the twisting of truths  the tyranny of monolithic thinking in a globalized world.  Instead of moving towards general and complete disarmament   including nuclear disarmament  which has been an ongoing demand of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries for decades   what we see is the promotion of the arms race and the squandering of wealth on new weapons and arms systems that deplete the resources that the world needs to mitigate the effects of climate change and address the very serious problems stemming from poverty and marginalization.  An attempt is made to prevent  in a politicized and selective fashion  the implementation of the principle   already proclaimed in the Non-Proliferation Treaty   that nations have the right to the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Some countries are threatened with war and destruction while the aggressive ally is permitted to have hundreds of nuclear devices and is constantly helped to modernize them.  How much longer will it take and how many new victims will have to die before the hawks of war understand that weapons are useless in resolving the critical problems of humankind? On a day like today  it is worth recalling the words uttered by President Fidel Castro in this General Assembly in October 1979:   “Let us say farewell to arms  and let us in a civilized manner dedicate ourselves to the most pressing problems of our times. This is the responsibility  this is the most sacred duty of the statesmen of all the world. Moreover  this is the basic premise for human survival.  There has been no progress to date towards fulfilling the Millennium Goals and the decisions of the major United Nations conferences held over the past decade. Poverty has not decreased. Inequality among and within countries is on the rise. Drinking water is not accessible to 1.1 billion people; 2.6 billion lack health services; over 800 million are illiterate and 115 million children do not attend primary school; 850 million starve every day. One per cent of the world’s richest people own 40 per cent of the wealth  while 50 per cent of the world’s population has barely 1 per cent. All this is happening in a world that spends a trillion dollars on weapons and another trillion on advertising.  The nearly 1 billion people living in developed countries consume approximately half of all the energy  while 2 billion poor people are still not acquainted with electricity. Is that the world that they want us to accept? Is that  by any chance  the future that we should settle for? Are we entitled or not to fight to change that state of things? Should we or should we not fight to make a better world possible?  Why are such colossal resources squandered on the killing industry and not used to save lives? Why are schools not built instead of nuclear submarines  and hospitals instead of “smart” bombs? Why are vaccines not produced instead of armoured vehicles  and more food instead of more fighter jets? Why is there no momentum given to research to fight AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis instead of promoting the manufacture of anti-missile shields? Why is there no war waged against poverty instead of against the poor?  Despite the fact that only $150 billion is needed to meet the Millennium Goals  we hear the hypocritical assertion that there is no source from which to obtain the necessary financial resources. That is a lie. There is money in abundance; what is lacking is the political will  ethics and the real commitment of those who have to make a choice.  If they really want money to appear  let the commitment of setting aside 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance be met once and for all. That would require $141 billion over and above the current amounts. At the height of deceit  the donor countries are now auditing the cancellations of a debt that they know they will not be able to collect in order to artificially inflate their contributions. Let the foreign debt  which our countries have already paid more than once  be cancelled. That would make it possible to set aside for development the over $400 billion currently used to service a debt that does not cease to grow.  Let the Doha Round for development come to an end and let the $300 billion in agricultural subsidies for the developed countries be removed. That would make it possible to earmark that money to fight rural poverty and food insecurity and to ensure fair prices for the export products of the underdeveloped countries.  Let our right to development be recognized. Let our right to have access to markets  patents and technologies be guaranteed  for those are now the exclusive monopoly of the powerful. Let our countries be helped in training professionals and scientists and let the brain drain stop.  The non-aligned countries need no alms; we need and demand justice. Let our rights to cultural diversity be respected  as well as our right to the preservation of our heritage  our symbols and our idiosyncrasies. That was the unanimous demand made in Tehran by the non-aligned countries at our ministerial meeting on human rights and cultural diversity.  The non-aligned countries want a more democratic and transparent United Nations in which the General Assembly  its most representative and democratic body  can truly implement the powers vested in it. We need a United Nations with a reformed Security Council  acting in conformity with the mandate granted to it by the Organization’s Charter without infringing on the functions and prerogatives of other organs of the system. There must be a Security Council with an expanded membership in line with the current composition of the United Nations  where the underdeveloped countries are the majority. There must be a Security Council with a radical modification to its working methods in order to allow transparency and the access of all Member States to its deliberations.  We need a Human Rights Council that prevents the repetition of the serious mistakes made by the former Commission on Human Rights. The Council should enshrine in its practices the principle that human rights are universal  indivisible and interdependent. It should put an end to selectivity and double standards. The non-aligned countries will firmly oppose the devilish schemes of some mighty quarters that  frustrated as they are at failing to achieve their goals  are now attempting to reopen and call into question the agreement reached in the hard and difficult process of institution-building in the Council.  The non-aligned countries will not give up on defence of the precepts that underlie our movement. Among the nations  we will foster relations of friendship based on respect for the principles of sovereignty  equality of rights and the self-determination of peoples.  We will continue to defend the right of the grief-stricken and heroic people of Palestine to have their own State  with East Jerusalem as its capital. We will continue to condemn the genocide committed against it. We will continue to proclaim the right of the people of Puerto Rico to sovereignty and to independence. The non-aligned countries account for nearly two thirds of the membership of the United Nations. Our demands will not be forgotten or our interests ignored.   This was supposed to be the end of my statement as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement. However  the shameless and gross behaviour of the United States President in this Hall yesterday morning now forces me to utter a few remarks on Cuba’s behalf.  With foul language and an arrogant tone  President Bush insulted and threatened some 10 countries. He gave orders in a firm and authoritarian fashion to the General Assembly  and with an officiousness never before seen in this Hall he dished out terms and judgments on a score of countries. It was an embarrassing show   the delirium tremens of the world’s policeman  the intoxication of imperial power imbued with the mediocrity and cynicism of those who threaten to launch wars in which they know their lives are not at stake.  The President of the United States has no right to pass judgment on any other sovereign nation on this planet. Having powerful nuclear weapons offers no right whatsoever to tread upon the rights of the peoples of the other 191 countries that are represented here. And the determination and courage of peoples should not be underestimated when it comes to defending their rights. After all  what prevails is not the power of cannons but the fairness of the ideas for which you are fighting. The warmongering and menacing President should have already learned this by now: sovereign equality of States  not regime change; respect for sovereignty  not unilateral certifications of good behaviour; respect for international law  not illegal blockades and wars.  President Bush talked about democracy  but we all know that he is lying. He came into office through fraud and deceit. We would have been spared his presence yesterday and would have listened to President Albert Gore talking about climate change and the risks to our species. We also recall how he brazenly supported the coup d’état against the President and the constitution of Venezuela.  He talked about peace  but we know that he is lying. We remember well when he threatened 60 or more countries  which he called “dark corners of the world  saying that he would wipe them off the face of the Earth with pre-emptive surprise attacks. Bush is a strange warrior who  from the rearguard  sends the young people of his country to kill and to die thousands of kilometres away.  He talked about human rights  but we know that he is lying. He is responsible for the death of 600 000 civilians in Iraq; he authorized tortures at the Guantánamo naval base and at Abu Ghraib; and he is an accessory to the kidnapping and disappearance of people  as well as to the secret flights and the clandestine prisons.  He talked about the fight against terrorism  but we know that he is lying. He has ensured complete impunity for the most abominable terrorist groups which  from Miami  have perpetrated horrendous crimes against the Cuban people. President Bush attacked the new Human Rights Council. He is bleeding from his wound; he is grunting his helplessness. He is haunted by the shamefulness that  during his term in office  the United States cannot even look forward to being a member because elections are through secret ballot. Cuba  on the other hand  was elected as a founding member of the Council with more than two thirds of the votes.  He talked about cooperation  development and prosperity for the rest of the world  but we all know that he is lying. He has been the most selfish and reckless politician we have ever seen. In a world that this year will bear witness to the death of 10 million children under the age of five through preventable diseases  his self-seeking and empty proposals of yesterday are but a sick joke.  President Bush has no moral authority or credibility to judge anyone. He should be held accountable to the world for his crimes. There is a limit to both arrogance and hypocrisy. There is a limit to lies and blackmail. Cuba rejects and condemns every one of the mendacious words uttered yesterday by the President of the United States.  Cuba appreciates the solidarity it has received from the General Assembly in its struggle against the blockade and the aggression that it has been forced to endure for nearly five decades. In particular  I thank the President of Nicaragua  Comrade Daniel Ortega  who is here in the Hall  for his kind words yesterday  and I thank all those who have spoken out for the rights and justice for the Cuban people. Cuba thanks all those who have supported its tenacious fight against terrorism and have raised their voice in favour of the release of five Cuban anti-terrorism fighters unjustly imprisoned in the United States.  Cuba will fight  along with all other members of the Non-Aligned Movement  in order to achieve a more just and democratic international order  in which our peoples can exercise their right to peace and development. We may be accused of being dreamers  but we are fighting with the conviction that today’s dreams will be tomorrow’s realities. We are fighting   and we will not stop fighting   with the conviction that even when there are individuals without decorum  there are always others who have in themselves the decorum of many and who bear within themselves an entire nations  as well as human dignity.

"43",1782,"CYP",62,2007,"Before I begin  I wish to indicate that my statement is complementary to that delivered yesterday (see ) by the Prime Minister of Portugal on behalf of the European Union  to which Cyprus fully subscribes.  As this is the first general debate since the election of the new Secretary-General  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his appointment to that crucial post and wish him every success. His report on the work of the Organization (A/62/1) demonstrates not only the broad spectrum of issues dealt with by the United Nations but also the comprehensive character and vast potential of multilateral diplomacy. Among the aspects of the Organization's work that are of particular interest  we note the disconcerting developments in the Middle East  the modest progress made with respect to the development agenda  the effects of the Organization's involvement in different crises  particularly in Africa  and the increasing impact of its humanitarian contribution.  To date  we have ample scientific data and other overwhelmingly convincing evidence suggesting that world climate is changing to the detriment of human and ecological systems as a result of human activity. Thus  our response to this alarming phenomenon should be the focus of our debate rather than the extent to which it exists.  We believe that it is important for us to define  from the outset  the scope of the response we are seeking to formulate. In the face of the quasi-irreversibility of the damage done thus far  we should at least put the necessary focus  resources and energy into curbing the galloping deterioration of the situation and urgently decide the first steps to protect our societies from large-scale future climate change.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has suggested a number of technological and policy instruments that are available to Governments for mitigation action. We stand ready to support the adoption of a number of sectoral policies and measures that the Panel has deemed effective  such as the use of renewable energy  the use of technology to produce energy cleanly  improved waste and waste-water management and the use of alternative technologies in exploiting human systems like forestry  fisheries and agriculture.  In deciding and enforcing our response  we see no plausible framework other than the United Nations. Aside from its unique position to address the issue because of its global character  its success in confronting a threat with such massive potential as climate change will be a litmus test for the relevance of our Organization. One could say that climate change is the modern-day equivalent of the security threat that necessitated the establishment of the Organization in 1945. It remains to be seen whether our system can be as effective in dealing with contemporary threats to humanity as it has been in dealing with more traditional security deficits.  Let me now turn to an issue with which the United Nations has had a long involvement  an issue which we aim to keep as one of the Organizationâ€™s priorities until it has been definitively resolved within the framework set out in the numerous relevant resolutions of this Organization.  For many years  the United Nations has engaged in strenuous efforts aimed at brokering a solution. It may be that the task has proved so very arduous  because the Cyprus issue  when stripped of the niceties of diplomatic terminology  is a question of foreign aggression and continuing occupation of a significant part of a sovereign State  entailing enclaved and missing persons  refugees and massive and enduring violations of human rights.  Cyprus has survived the most difficult circumstances created by the many facets of the problem and has primarily insisted on one thing vis-Ã -vis the involvement of the United Nations in its resolution: the full application of the values on which this Organization was founded and which it has worked so hard to promote.  So  why does this problem persist after so many years during which the national  regional and international political landscape has undergone dramatic changes? Certainly  it is neither for lack of political will nor for lack of effort on our part. Rather  the occupying Power has not displayed any motivation to solve the problem  and this has only been reinforced by the Annan plan  which satisfied all Turkish desiderata  thus being readily accepted by the Turkish side. Instead  Turkey has used its dominant position to command trade-offs of all sorts.  Secondly  Turkeyâ€™s long-standing objective of gaining political and military control over Cyprus remains unchanged. Despite declaratory remarks of willingness to solve the Cyprus problem  its actions confirm its dedication to its ab initio pursuit of controlling Cyprus by partitioning it geographically into two ethnically clean parts  with Turkey securing rights of suzerainty and the â€œrightâ€ of intervention in Cyprus.  Thirdly  efforts to solve the Cyprus problem have not been filtered through a system of values and norms of international law. They have not been tailored to tackling the roots of the problem or even to the problem itself; rather  their centre of gravity seems to have been the kind of solution the occupying Power would want or could  at least  tolerate. In fact  it is clear through the conduct and negotiating positions of Turkey that it has not contemplated a solution outside the boundaries of the status quo.  Fourthly  shifting the problem from the context of its origin â€” that of invasion and occupation â€” has led to a problem-solving methodology that divides the distance that separates the parties  caving in to the demands of the more powerful party and making success conditional upon the otherâ€™s magnanimity.  Fifthly  the occupying Power has insisted on discussing elements that form neither part of the genesis of the problem nor part of its solution. The Cyprus problem is caused by not bad community relations but by outside intervention. Persisting  therefore  with a constitutional arrangement  set up primarily on the basis of ethnic origin â€” without due respect for the overriding democratic principles of liberty and equality of all citizens â€” insults the dignity of those citizens and dooms the viability of any settlement.  We currently find ourselves engaged in an effort to implement a process consisting of an Agreement concluded and signed by the two communities in Cyprus on 8 July 2006 and complemented by letters exchanged between the leaders of the two communities and the then Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs of the United Nations  Mr. Gambari  on 15 November 2006. The surprising laboriousness in the implementation of this carefully crafted Agreement â€” the purpose of which is to prepare the ground for subsequent negotiation and to lead to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue â€” is not inherent to this particular process. We should therefore concentrate on implementing what has been agreed. The pace can only be determined by progress  with full-fledged negotiations as needed. Sidelining or circumventing stages of the process will lead  not to expediting the solution  but to confirming the deadlock.  So  what does the future hold for the mission of good offices entrusted to the Secretary-General by the Security Council? For our part  we remain fully committed  as it is clear to us that we cannot sustain the status quo and must insist on a meaningful and forward-looking process that can elicit concrete results  leading to the establishment of a bizonal  bicommunal federation  within the true meaning of each of these terms. The only process that can take us forward is the one established by the 8 July agreed process I have just outlined. This process is expected to test suggestions  ideas and alternatives at the expert level  adequately prepare the ground and submit to the leaders  any points that warrant political compromise or agreement. Although the last meeting with the Turkish Cypriot leader did not signal the beginning of the implementation of the Agreement as we had hoped  we will not rescind our efforts to put the 8 July process back on track. The element of time is very important; however  only progress through preparing the ground can bring us sooner to an agreed settlement. With a view to achieving progress  I submitted to the Secretary-General certain ideas and proposals that I hope will contribute to this end.   Turkey's intentions are not only manifest in the non-resolution of the Cyprus problem after all these years. They transpire from all its actions: the non-normalization of its relations with Cyprus as a first step to becoming a European partner  the non-removal of any of its troops from Cypriot soil as a confidence-building measure  the intensification of efforts to project a secessionist entity in Cyprus and its systematic violations of our sovereign air and maritime space and of the military status quo. This was recently confirmed by explicit statements of its leadership at the highest political level referring to a settlement based on two peoples  two democracies  two States and two religions. That is an arrangement we shall never accept.  Over the past year  we have also witnessed repeated attempts by the occupying Power to illegally explore my country's natural resources and to sabotage our sovereign right to explore and manage these resources. It has carried out unauthorized demolitions of Greek Cypriot houses in the areas it occupies and it continues to destroy cultural and religious heritage. It has intensified the large-scale illegal exploitation of Greek Cypriot properties in the occupied part of Cyprus  not least because this will skew the terms of a future settlement.  At the same time  Turkey pursues its own strategic objectives in Cyprus at the expense of reunification and is only guided by its own interests and not those of Turkish Cypriots. It has ascertained over the years that the occupied part of Cyprus would come completely under its political  economic and military control. We regret to note that Turkey has been trying to involve our friends and neighbours in this ill-conceived effort. Underpinning this strategy is the intent to legitimize the fait accompli of the invasion and attribute political status to its results. Such a strategy could not have been achieved without presenting the Turkish Cypriot community as victims  not of Turkish aggression as really is the case  but of Greek Cypriots for resisting this fait accompli. A prime example of those tactics has been the ongoing campaign to deceivingly suggest that the Turkish Cypriot community is economically disadvantaged because it is isolated. Considering that the per capita income of Turkish Cypriots has doubled over the past three years and that they now enjoy the 59th highest per capita income in the world  one can easily detect the political agenda behind the attempt to link their economic development with the fate of the illegal regime.  For years now  we have been advocating that the road to solving the Cyprus problem is not via the exclusion of the inconvenient truths that underlie it or the bypassing of principles that are  for us  the guarantee that the settlement of the Cyprus problem will continue to be valid and relevant in a constantly changing world.  Equally important  we regard the preservation of our interests and those of Turkey in our region not as mutually exclusive but as complementary and interdependent. Our vision must be to bequeath to future generations the legacy of friendship  cooperation and good neighbourliness. We are afforded the opportunity to avoid eternalizing this feud and we should seize it. "
"44",1806,"CZE",62,2007,"Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I also welcome the highly respected Secretary-General to the first session of the Assembly convened since he assumed his post.  I would like to start by saying that my country is proud to be one of the founding fathers of the United Nations in its current form. The Czech Republic  a successor State of Czechoslovakia  participated actively in all kinds of United Nations activities in the past and it will continue to do so in the future. We take part in the work not only of the United Nations itself  but also of its specialized organizations and agencies such as UNESCO  the United Nations Development Programme  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  the World Health Organization  the International Atomic Energy Agency and many others. We have always supported any meaningful initiative that leads to the increase of stability and prosperity in the world.  I am proud to confirm that the Czech Republic has the ambition to be elected to the Security Council as a non-permanent member for the period 2008-2009. I believe that we can be trusted by the majority of Member countries and that we deserve their votes. We are convinced that we have already demonstrated our devotion to freedom  democracy  international cooperation  economic development and respect for the sovereignty of countries belonging to the community of nations. My country served in the Security Council in 1994-1995. We tried to do our best. We were reliable and committed to hard work. I can assure the Assembly that we will now do an even a better job.  We have always recognized the principal responsibility of the Security Council for maintaining peace and security. Since the 1990s  the Czech Republic has contributed to more than 20 United Nations peacekeeping missions and United Nations-mandated operations in the Balkans  Asia and Africa. We deeply believe in the prevention and non-violent resolution of disputes and conflicts. That can be proved by our own behaviour; witness the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992. Over the past several years  we have also multiplied our official development assistance.  In the past 18 years  the Czech Republic has undergone radical and dynamic development  which was made possible by the fall of communism and by our rapid departure from that oppressive  inhuman and inefficient political  social and economic system. Our transformation strategy  based on the acceptance of political pluralism  parliamentary democracy and a market economy  was successful.  A further important impetus to our development was our approaching the European Union and our entry into it three years ago. Today  the Czech Republic is a full-fledged member of the Union and will hold the European Union presidency in the first half of 2009. It might be of interest to the Assembly that the slogan of the Czech presidency will be Europe without barriers. We mean by that the removing of both internal and external European Union barriers. I fully support that concept  as I strongly believe in the need to remove barriers that hinder economic progress  especially in developing countries.  We consider the United Nations to be an extremely important and  in fact  irreplaceable platform. There is no substitute for it in the current world. It is a platform for meetings and consultations  for dialogue and  eventually  for reaching agreements on treaties among nations sharing the same or similar values and political stances. This unique platform is based on the plurality of views of its 192 Member countries and on our mutual respect for our sometimes differing positions. The ambition of the United Nations is not  and should never be  the search for one obligatory  unitary view imposed by some of us on those who disagree.  I did not use the term “platform” by chance and without purpose. By using it  I implicitly object to the alternative concept: the concept of global governance based on the indefensible idea that the world can be globally governed  masterminded  controlled  managed and/or even planned. To aspire to do that is something we can never accept. It is an ambition based on the abuse of reason and on the pretence of knowledge. Democracy is something else.  There are some among us who prefer the operational efficiency - or the ability to act - of this Organization to the recognition of the existence of different views. They want to make decisions in an easier and faster way. Our communist past tells us that we should not do that. We also want the United Nations to be reasonably operational  but we categorically oppose that happening at the expense of individual Member States. We have to respect the views of individual member countries regardless of their size. It is crucial that every Member State has equal status and that its voice not be ignored.  We have to go forward. The United Nations needs changes. We do support reform of the United Nations  because the Organization should reflect the current situation in the world more than the situation of the era when it was founded. Some changes are inevitable  and we should discuss them seriously.  To our great regret  in the world at present we are witnessing many cases where there is a lack of freedom and democracy. Our task for the future is to minimize such cases. However  I do not see and hear the terms ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" as much or as often as they deserve. We hear other words more frequently: aid  government initiatives and interventions  social justice  positive rights  environment  resources  climate  problem solving  facing threats and global challenges among others.  Here we have to be very careful. We should support meaningful activities  not programmes that in effect put constraints on local development. We should use natural resources efficiently and protect the environment  but not in a way that restricts human activity and harms economic development. We would help global development more by reducing barriers than by providing conditional aid. Reducing protectionism and lowering export subsidies is a far more efficient way to help developing countries than anything else. We should not allow developing countries to be blocked from their own economic growth by additional burdens imposed upon them that they will not be able to bear.  At the conference on climate change held the day before yesterday  I resolutely warned against the unjustified alarmism of global-warming activists and their fellow-travellers in some Governments and international organizations  but even that potential problem  as well as any other  can never be solved without relying on freedom  free markets  free trade and other attributes of free society.  Preserving the environment is very important  but we have to be modest in our attempts to control the complexities of the world. Let us use the potential of this Organization as much as possible. Let us cooperate  let us listen to each other  let us negotiate to the last possible moment and let us try to understand others. The Czech Republic tries to follow those rules. "
"45",1868,"DEU",62,2007,"Please accept  my congratulations  Mr. President  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I wish you every success.  We are currently experiencing a period of dramatic changes. Great opportunities are accompanied by considerable risks. Global structures are changing. States  economies and societies are becoming networked as never before. That is what we call globalization.  The good thing about that development is that prosperity is increasing  and more and more people are escaping from poverty. The challenge that that development poses is that not everyone has their fair share of this prosperity. There are considerable imbalances. We thus need a global awareness  beyond national boundaries  of our joint responsibility in order to master the major challenges facing our world.  Climate change is undoubtedly one of the central challenges facing humanity today. I therefore very much welcome your decision  Mr. President  to make climate change the focus of this year’s session of the General Assembly. Never before have the facts been so clear  the consensus among scientists so great or the need for action so indisputable. Each and every country is affected by the impact of climate change. No one country can tackle it alone. Not to take action would incur immense costs and cause new global conflicts.  What does that mean for the way ahead? In quite concrete terms  it means that any contribution from individual States or groups of States is welcome. However  I would like to add most emphatically that such contributions can only complement a post-Kyoto agreement under the auspices of the United Nations. They can never replace it.  This session of the General Assembly therefore has to set the course for the next vital step: the climate conference in Bali. Environment ministers will have to agree in Bali on a clear road map so that negotiations can be successfully concluded by 2009. There are three key elements: a common understanding on the scale of emissions reduction  a common understanding on fair national contributions and a common understanding on the instruments we should use both to protect the climate and to foster economic growth.  The scope of the need for action is becoming increasingly clear. We must at least halve global emissions by the middle of the century. For this we have a clear guiding principle: the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. Industrialized countries must embrace ambitious absolute reduction targets. During the German presidency the European Union adopted bold targets for 2020. All industrialized countries will have to drastically reduce their per capita emissions.  Emerging economies will first of all have to decouple their economic growth from emissions. In the long term  per capita emissions in both industrialized countries and emerging economies will have to converge at a level compatible with our global climate protection target.  Such a process of long-term convergence offers all countries scope to develop. It does not demand too much of anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that only a United Nations agreement can provide the dependability this will require.   Climate protection will therefore be a litmus test of the international community’s ability to act effectively in the twenty-first century. For  on our own continent  we Europeans know from our daily experience that   although any individual country is too small to make a real difference   together we can achieve much.  In the light of our experience  I believe three principles are of crucial importance to our common future. First  economic strength and social responsibility belong together. This principle applies both to how States treat their citizens and to how States treat each other. It emphasizes the right and freedom of each individual to achieve their full potential. At the same time  it upholds cohesion and solidarity  while categorically rejecting isolationism and protectionism.  That is why we are seeking a balanced and comprehensive agreement on multilateral trade. In concrete terms  this means that we have to bring the Doha Round to an early and successful conclusion. Too much time has been wasted. We have to seize the last chance for negotiations this autumn. Our aim must be transparent financial markets and effective protection of intellectual property  as well as minimum legal and social standards. For I am convinced that there can be no fair competition without common ground rules.  We can only achieve cohesion and solidarity in a global development partnership. With the Millennium Development Goals  the international community has laid down binding quantifiable targets and deadlines for the first time. Together with its EU partners  Germany has undertaken to reach the United Nations 0.7 per cent target no later than 2015. We stand by these pledges.  There can be no doubt that genuine partnership places all sides under an obligation   an obligation to step up the fight against corruption  to aim for better governance and to better protect human rights. We want to support Africa in particular. There have been encouraging developments on the continent but unfortunately  also  serious setbacks  for example in Zimbabwe.  “Growth and responsibility in the world economy” is  therefore  also the motto guiding this year’s German presidency of the Group of Eight (G-8).  The second principle is that we have to strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations. In my view  there is absolutely no doubt   the United Nations is the place where binding joint responses can be found to global challenges. But the United Nations is in need of reform. This is true  above all  of the Security Council. In many crisis situations it needs to be able to come up quickly with universally binding proposals. To do this  it must have international legitimacy. However  the present composition of the Security Council no longer reflects the world today. There is  therefore  no alternative to adapting it to political realities.  My country has over the past years been actively involved in this debate. Germany is prepared to assume more responsibility  and to take on a permanent seat on the Security Council. What we need now are tangible results. We are by no means only at the start of our endeavours. The United Nations reform process has already produced some results  such as the report of the High-level Panel on United Nations system-wide coherence and the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission.  But time is short. There are numerous crises we have to deal with right now. And notwithstanding the many differing factors that have led to these crises  they all have one thing in common: they can only be solved multilaterally. The key to ending them is unity of purpose. This is particularly true with respect to Iran. Iran has continuously worked on its nuclear programme in clear contradiction of the demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations. Nobody should be in the slightest doubt as to the dangerous nature of this programme. Iran is ignoring Security Council resolutions. Iran is blatantly threatening Israel.  Let us not fool ourselves. If Iran were to acquire the nuclear bomb  the consequences would be disastrous  first and foremost for the existence of Israel; secondly  for the entire region; and ultimately for all of us in Europe and the world who attach any importance to the values of liberty  democracy and human dignity. That is why we have to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear arms.  The international community must not allow itself to be divided or have its decisive response to Iran’s provocations undermined in any way. The world does not have to prove to Iran that Iran is building a nuclear bomb. Iran has to convince the world that it is not striving towards such a bomb.  Each and every German Chancellor before me has shouldered Germany’s special responsibility for the existence of Israel. I  too  pledge to live up to this responsibility that our history has bequeathed us. It is one of the fundamental principles that guides my country. In other words  Israel’s security is non-negotiable for me as German Chancellor. And that being the case  we have to do more than pay lip-service to it. Together with its partners  Germany will continue to seek a diplomatic solution. With this aim in mind  Germany will   if Iran does not come around   firmly advocate additional and harsher sanctions.  Unity of purpose is also the key in the fight against international terrorism  and especially in our efforts aimed at security and stability in Afghanistan. Unity of purpose is also vital for ensuring a peaceful future in Kosovo  where NATO and the European Union play a particularly active role. We want a solution under United Nations auspices. All parties are now called upon to show a willingness to compromise.  We also strongly support the efforts of the Middle East Quartet for peace in that region. Germany is a staunch advocate of the vision of two States  within secure borders and in peace  for the Jewish people in Israel and for the Palestinians in Palestine. We welcome the fact that both parties are continuing their talks with great vigour  above all with a view to the Middle East conference scheduled for November.  The third principle is that we have to strengthen our shared immutable values. In my opinion  one of the great dangers of the twenty-first century is that crises and conflicts could give rise to a clash of civilizations. This must not happen. For this reason  I plead for tolerance   tolerance as properly understood  not “anything goes” masquerading as tolerance. Everybody must be able to follow his or her own path  but it must be a path within the international community  not outside it.  This path is clearly departed from wherever massive human rights violations are committed  as in Darfur. A human tragedy is being played out there. Too much time has already been squandered. Now is the time to act. The crimes perpetrated there must not go unpunished. This path has been departed from in Myanmar  where human rights have likewise been disregarded for years. I urge the Government not to use force against the peaceful demonstrators and finally to make way for a democratic future for the country. This path is also departed from when political assassinations are carried out  as in the case of Rafik Hariri or the recent cowardly attack just a few days ago in Lebanon. The Hariri tribunal must commence its work with all possible speed. I call on Syria to grant Lebanon diplomatic recognition at long last.  It is my fundamental conviction that we must  time and again  muster the strength to assert our shared values of freedom and democracy. In order to do that  we need an unshakeable foundation.   We have such a foundation: the Charter of the United Nations. It was written when Europe and wide swathes of the rest of the world lay in ruins. At the most basic level  it is a statement that  notwithstanding all the dark chapters and tortuous turns of our history  universal human rights do exist. In other words  what it all comes down to is respecting and protecting the dignity of each individual person. That is the underlying reason why we assemble here each year and work together for the future of our peoples.  Germany will do its utmost to advance that work. We look forward to fruitful cooperation with all partners in the United Nations. "
"46",1927,"DMA",62,2007,"Let me at the outset congratulate Mr. Kerim on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session and assure him of the cooperation of the Dominica delegation throughout this session. I commend his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her leadership during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  I also wish to congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his election. I wish him a long and successful tenure  and hope that under his leadership the United Nations will give greater attention to the plight of the world’s small island developing States  which are among the most vulnerable to climate change  natural disasters and a rise in sea levels.  In the interdependent world which we live in today  the promotion of the fundamental values of peace  democracy  human rights and development depends on strong multilateral institutions. Dominica believes that it is only a strong United Nations  sensitive to the variable geometry of its own complex construction  that can serve as the foundation of our shared ambitions for effective multilateralism and a rules-based international order.  The experience of the past decade has taught us one important lesson: global challenges require global responses  and those challenges can receive the appropriate responses only through the framework of multilateral action. The United Nations is the undisputed centre for multilateralism  and we must all demonstrate unwavering commitment to vesting in the United Nations the authority and to offering it the space to undertake effective interventions in the interest of the preservation of human life  human rights  peace  justice  democracy and the rule of law.  More than ever  we need a United Nations which is not only guided by the principles that oversaw its creation  but capable of adapting to the growing challenges of today’s globalized world. We need an effective United Nations that will place the highest priority on development  while having the capacity to respond to the various crises that threaten international peace and security.  The work of the international community in poverty alleviation must be accelerated as the chasm between the rich and the poor continues to widen. In that connection  the importance of achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 is critical. We must therefore rededicate ourselves to the implementation of the actions called for in the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty and in relevant resolutions of the General Assembly  including those related to the right to development  the alleviation of burdensome debt  and fair and equitable trading rules.   Climate change is the most pressing environmental problem humankind has ever faced. It seriously threatens human security and will undermine our ability to achieve the MDGs. Unless there is a global and collective response  this planet will become unlivable for most of us.  Small island developing States are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change  even though they contribute the least to emissions of greenhouse gases. Sea-level rise threatens the territorial existence of small island developing States  and low-lying islands in the Indian Ocean  the Pacific and the Caribbean may simply disappear in the next 30 years or less as the melting of ice caps and mountain glaciers on all continents becomes the new reality of unchecked climate change. The disappearance of beaches and coastal tourism plants and the loss of coastal communication infrastructure would devastate the tourism economy of most island States. Other regions are also beginning to experience the effects of those climatic changes  with persistent conditions of drought followed by devastating flooding.  Rising sea temperature is causing death and the bleaching of coral reefs  which in turn are impacting negatively on fish stocks  the major protein source of island States. It is estimated that a one-degree increase in sea temperature over pre-industrial levels will lead to significant loss of tuna and dolphin stocks for a large number of island States.  Rising sea temperature also provides a fertile ground for the development of tropical storms and hurricanes  which affect the Caribbean region every year. Climate change is contributing to the frequency and severity of those storms. We are currently in the midst of the 2007 hurricane season and  over a two-week period in the month of August  the Caribbean region suffered the onslaught of two category-5 hurricanes  Dean and Felix. Those storms seriously affected Dominica  Guadeloupe  Martinique  Saint Lucia  Jamaica  Belize  Honduras  Nicaragua and Mexico. We are only half-way through this hurricane season  which is forecast to have seven category-5 hurricanes. It may very well be that the worst is yet to come.  My own country  Dominica  was severely battered by Hurricane Dean  the third-worst hurricane to make landfall in the Caribbean since 1850. After 15 hours of buffeting by winds of 110 miles per hour and continuous rainfall  our agricultural economy was destroyed  our infrastructure devastated by swollen rivers and numerous landslides  and our housing stock seriously affected. We appreciate greatly the solidarity of a number of countries  regional and extra-regional  and the generous support they provided in the immediate aftermath  but now comes the serious challenge of reconstruction  which is estimated to cost over a $100 million. The high-level event on climate change helped to underscore that doing nothing about climate change will have enormous negative implications for all countries  and more particularly for the least developed countries and small island developing States. The pace of climate change negotiations is disconcertingly slow because it is not adequately responsive to the urgency dictated by science.  We urge all the nations of the world to come to Bali in December prepared to advance the multilateral negotiations. A demonstration of collective political will and commitment to determined action will be critical if we are to reach agreement on a fair  effective  flexible and inclusive climate regime under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. Developed countries and the more advanced developing countries must make a greater effort to do more and to be considerate of the emergency situation facing the small island States.  We continue to stress that the vulnerable situation of the small island developing States must be addressed through the vigorous implementation of the actions called for in the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.  We call for the full implementation of the mandates contained in the Millennium Declaration  in particular the commitments to development and poverty eradication  the protection of the common environment  and the realization of human rights  democracy and good governance. As a follow-up to the reform commitments emanating from the 2005 Summit  we welcome the reports of the High-level Panel and of the Secretary-General on system-wide coherence  and we hope for the strengthened capacity of the United Nations in development  humanitarian assistance and the environment.  The adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by the General Assembly was an important achievement. It will be meaningless  however  if we do not address its full implementation. Small States like Dominica and the rest of the States members of the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States must be assisted to meet the various obligations required by the implementation of the counter-terrorism conventions.  As a country with an indigenous Kalinago population  Dominica is proud to have played a role in the negotiation process that led to the recent adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People  and we call on those Member States that have not yet done so to embrace the Declaration.  Dominica applauds the African Union for its unwavering efforts towards the maintenance of peace and security on the African continent  and we are supportive of the long-term vision of an African peace and security architecture. In that context  Dominica welcomes the creation of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur  which we hope will contribute to the political resolution of the conflict there and bring to an end its tragic humanitarian consequences in the Sudan and the neighbouring States.  In our region  we welcome the continuing engagement of the United Nations and the Organization of American States in Haiti. We urge the United Nations to make the commitment to going beyond the current engagement through the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) to a longer-term engagement that will bring sustainable economic stability and development to Haiti. We appreciate the important role of Brazil and the other Member States that are participating in MINUSTAH  but we must be careful not to see those interventions as the emergency response of an international fire brigade quickly extinguishing political conflagrations and remaining only long enough to dampen the embers of renewed conflict.  Haiti’s problems stem from underdevelopment and extensive periods of dictatorship. It is in democracy and development  therefore  that the solutions for Haiti lie. A stable and prosperous Haiti will significantly strengthen the Caribbean Community and contribute meaningfully to the process of deepening regional integration and the attendant march towards the Caribbean single market and economy.  Recent violent upheavals in Myanmar are not encouraging for the hoped-for resolution of the long-standing difficulties afflicting that country in its transition to democracy. We urge influential countries in South-East Asia that have friendly relations with the military regime in Rangoon to use their good offices in support of the United Nations effort to bring about a political solution and national reconciliation among all concerned parties. The continued presence of the Republic of France  the Kingdom of the Netherlands  the United Kingdom and the United States of America in the Caribbean should provide an opportunity for the strategic engagement of those metropoles  Canada and Spain with the independent Caribbean States to create in the Caribbean a zone of peace  security and prosperity  complementing the invaluable development assistance of the People’s Republic of China  the Republic of Cuba  the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  Japan and the European Union.  I wish to underscore the vital importance of a fair global trading system as the only way for small States to survive in this globalized world. We do not want to depend on fast-disappearing development assistance. We want to have the assurance that we will be able to trade the goods and services we produce on terms and conditions that will enable us to build our economies and to provide employment for our citizens. That is why we continue to call for the earliest possible conclusion of the Doha Development Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO). We urge the major trading nations to demonstrate a spirit of compromise and constructiveness  backed by a genuine will to commit to a balanced agreement that embraces the principle of special and differential treatment for small island developing States and places development at the centre of any final agreement.  Dominica has made important progress in its quest to adapt to the challenges of trade liberalization and its attendant preference erosion. Those changing terms of trade have progressively devastated our primary source of foreign exchange earnings   the export of bananas. That persistent assault on our banana exports to the European Union through unrelenting recourse to the WTO dispute settlement body has impacted negatively on our overall economy. As a result  we have had to undergo a structural adjustment programme and undertake stringent fiscal measures that have required sacrifices by the population as a whole in order to stabilize the deteriorating fiscal and economic position. We have turned the corner and returned to a period of sustained economic growth  and are moving steadily to the diversification of our economy. The impact of Hurricane Dean so soon afterwards will therefore be doubly devastating.  We are working towards a new energy regime that will significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels for our energy needs and slow the haemorrhaging of scarce foreign exchange earnings to meet the ever-rising cost of petroleum products. We plan to increase our current 40-per cent renewable energy generation from hydropower through initiatives for geothermal energy development and further expansion of hydropower. We will need the continuing partnership of the development partners to remain on that path towards successful economic transformation.  May I call on the United Nations once more to rededicate itself to making development the highest priority of this body. Together  the developed countries and the developing countries must work in a cooperative manner to address the challenges of climate change and sustainable development. We can work together to defeat poverty and underdevelopment and to give hope and dignity to all peoples. To achieve that  we must implement the decisions that we take here in this General Assembly every year. The time for action is now. "
"47",1971,"DNK",62,2007,"At the Millennium Summit in 2000  an unprecedented number of world leaders came together and committed themselves to an ambitious global agenda for the years ahead. This agenda was further reinforced at the 2005 World Summit  where we also adopted the far-reaching principle of responsibility to protect.  By the very nature of the commitments from the Millennium Declaration and the World Summit  it was globally recognized that there can be no development without security and human rights   and vice versa. We owe it to ourselves and to the world community to take stock of our progress. How well  then  have we met this challenge so far?  At the institutional level  there can be no question that important progress has been achieved  as witnessed by the establishment of the Central Emergency Response Fund  the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. But institution-building alone will not do. We need to show the necessary resolve to make these new institutions effective instruments in the service of the global community. We have achieved little if we do not endeavour to ensure that they fulfil their stated purposes and that they realize their true potential. Our challenge now is to address the substantive issues and to do so in earnest. As we cross the halfway mark towards 2015  substantial progress has been made at the global level towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The results achieved through market-oriented economic reform in Asia and Latin America over the past decade prove that eradication of poverty is not an elusive  unattainable goal.  But  again  there is no room for complacency. A substantial increase in efforts is still needed  especially if sub-Saharan Africa is to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The facts are quite simple. If progress in Africa is not accelerated  we will not live up to our responsibility. Denmark believes that the time has come to arrange a United Nations summit focusing on the progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and on financing for development.  Africa remains at the heart of Danish development assistance. The Danish Government firmly believes that development assistance to Africa should increase. We need to live up to the promise to double aid for Africa by 2010. Denmark is keeping its part of the bargain. We are committed to providing 0.8 per cent of our national income in development assistance. Two thirds of our bilateral assistance will go to the African continent.  But clearly  development assistance alone is not enough. Trade and good governance is key to development. There is no substitute for national ownership and for national commitment to good governance or for transparent and liberal trade and investment regimes that allow developing countries to benefit from globalization.  It is a key goal for the Danish Government to promote good governance  democracy and human rights with no impunity for crimes against humanity and we will do this through an active foreign policy. Denmark will seriously do its best to contribute to a more effective United Nations and to assist countries that have a strong commitment to development but lack the necessary resources.  Climate change has undoubtedly become one of the most urgent global challenges of our times  one that  by its very definition  must be dealt with on a truly global level. Climate change will affect the poorest and the weakest the most. And countries will have a very different capacity to act. Therefore  we have to base our joint efforts on the notion of common but differentiated responsibilities.  Denmark is pleased to host the fifteenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Climate Change  to be held in December 2009. We have already commenced the preparations for the conference. Our ambitions are high. We must reach consensus on an effective and multilateral post-Kyoto agreement. The Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen is the last call if the agreement is to enter into force by 2012.  We commend the Secretary-General for his leadership on this issue. In our view  an inclusive United Nations-based multilateral approach is crucial if we are to bring all parties together in responding to the global climate challenge.  The High-level Event on Climate Change held here in New York last week was an illustration of this commitment. I want to echo two essential points made at the High-level Event that were also taken up by the Secretary-General in his conclusions. First  I would note that the Conference of the Parties to take place in Bali next December represents a crucial cut-off date. If we are serious about fighting climate change  the thirteenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Climate Change in Bali must define a clear timetable for negotiations towards a comprehensive post-2012 framework. Secondly  I would note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) remains the only legitimate framework for truly global negotiations on climate change. It is within the UNFCCC that an ambitious agreement must be reached to reduce global emissions and to counter climate change.  Another major global challenge to which Denmark attaches great importance is to obtain equal opportunities for women. Here  we also see a crucial role for an effective United Nations where gender equality is dealt with in a strengthened and systematic way  especially at the country level. In our view  no one should be excluded from contributing to peace  freedom and development. It is  therefore  of paramount importance   as a judicial  moral and ethical responsibility   that women everywhere have the same opportunities as men. In the fight against poverty  it is an absolute necessity. Women must have equal rights as well as full access to employment  land and financial resources. Only then can development assistance realize its true potential and poverty be alleviated.  Donors must actively support partner countries in achieving gender equality. In the coming years  Denmark will have a strong focus on women and their role in development and conflict resolution   setting goals  earmarking funds and monitoring progress to ensure that policies create results.   Making a difference in that respect will require leadership from all parties. Without addressing the role of women  we will never manage to halve extreme poverty by 2015. And our efforts to support the rights and empowerment of women must be complemented by a targeted effort to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights.  As we stand here today  we face more global challenges than ever before. The world faces many unresolved conflicts  not least in Africa. We need to stay focused and to enhance the Organization’s capacity in conflict prevention  conflict management and peacebuilding.  A strong United Nations is required to cope with the global challenges of today and tomorrow. Only a strong and effective United Nations can show the necessary political leadership with regard to development  humanitarian crisis and conflicts.  In the Sudan  we have an obligation to help the people of Darfur achieve peace through the restoration of stability. The killings  violence and atrocities must end. This has taken far too long. There is now finally some progress in the attempts to find a solution to the conflict in Darfur  and we have a responsibility to ensure that it is implemented. Denmark actively supports the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur as well as the resumed political process. It raises real hope for improvement in the deplorable situation on the ground and in the prospects for a long-term political solution. As part of this process  we must implement the arrest warrants of the International Criminal Court and bring perpetrators of crime to justice.  Afghanistan must be one of the top priorities of the international community and of the United Nations. It is important to maintain broad consensus among all international partners regarding the need to carry through what we have started. To that end  we need the United Nations to play a stronger role in Afghanistan. A coordinated engagement   civilian as well as military   is a precondition for success. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) must use its full potential to coordinate the international efforts and as a counterpart to the Afghans. And UNAMA should be present in each and every province  including in the south.  In Kosovo  only a solution to the final-status issue will ensure stability and prosperity in the region. We share the opinion of the Secretary-General that the status quo is not sustainable. We hope for results in the new negotiations. As stated by the presidency of the European Union (EU)  the EU will live up to its particular responsibility and participate actively in the collective effort to bring the parties closer together. The goal is to obtain a comprehensive political solution that will lead to a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo.  We also believe that the United Nations continues to be an international focal point for our common efforts in the fight against terrorism. Last year’s adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy was of crucial importance. It underlined the firm commitment of the international community to stand united against those who wish to threaten international peace and security. The next step should be to finalize the negotiations on a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism. That would send another strong political signal of our unity. Adoption of the convention would be a worthy achievement of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.  Finally  let me say a few words on United Nations reform and the institutional challenge for the Organization. The starting point is clear: to ensure the necessary reforms of the United Nations  there is no substitute for strong political will on the part of individual Member States.  Reforms of United Nations operational activities are taking shape. However  much work remains to be done if the recommendations of the High-level Panel are to be followed and if the United Nations is truly to deliver as one. It is of paramount importance to make the United Nations more focused and effective at the country level. Experiences from the pilot countries are encouraging and should inspire further action.  The Organization’s governance structures also require further reform. The General Assembly should keep its focus on decision-making regarding important matters and leave detailed management to managers. The Security Council would benefit from reform that makes it more representative. Denmark is therefore encouraged by the new momentum in discussions on Security Council reform.  But  first and foremost  strengthening the United Nations requires an understanding that the United Nations cannot do everything for everyone at the same time. We need to agree on a common vision and on priorities for the Organization. We need to take a step back from the day-to-day agenda and focus on the role that a strong United Nations could play in the future   which points towards strengthening the United Nations in relation to three of its unique features.   The first feature is conflict resolution and prevention as undertaken by the Security Council  the General Assembly and the good offices of the Secretary-General  as well as through United Nations peacekeeping efforts.   The second feature is strengthening of the capacity of the United Nations system to assist countries in the early phases of recovery following conflicts  or countries with very weak institutions. Here  the United Nations has a key role to play. We should help to build stronger bridges from peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance to peacebuilding  reconstruction and development. We should help to build up States and to ensure that weak States do not fall back into conflict or chaos. The Peacebuilding Commission will be essential in this regard.   Thirdly and finally  in the area of international norm-setting  where the United Nations has already shaped the international agenda for action  one of the goals should be to enhance the role played by the Organization in ensuring respect for human rights. As Members of the United Nations  we have taken on the shared responsibility of protecting those in the most vulnerable situations  not least children.  What is needed now is to follow through and to catalyse action. That is no small task  even for a strong United Nations. "
"48",2016,"DOM",62,2007,"On behalf of the Government and the people of the Dominican Republic  it is a pleasure to extend our warmest congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia upon his recent election as President of the General Assembly. We would also like to take this opportunity to greet the members of the General Assembly.  During the four years following the Millennium Summit of 2000  the Dominican Republic went through a crisis  during which our national currency was devalued by 100 per cent. Our working class had to double its efforts simply to meet their basic subsistence needs. Drug trafficking and high levels of crime gained a foothold  and our credibility went down worldwide. According to the statistics of the World Bank  the United Nations Development Programme and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean  more than 1.5 million out of the 9 million Dominicans sank into the lowest levels of poverty. At that time  we were facing one of the most dramatic crises in the modern history of the Dominican Republic.  Since we took the reins of administration in 2004  the Dominican Republic has managed to recover the confidence of investors and entrepreneurs. We have been able to reactivate economic growth. We have been able to reduce inflation. We have increased jobs and improved social conditions and quality of life for the Dominican people.  However  exactly when we began  just like the phoenix rising from its own ashes  a gloomy international picture threatened to darken our prospects for future growth. In recent weeks  for example  the price of oil on the international market has reached an unprecedented rate  and projections point towards continued increases. These price increases are asphyxiating our economies.  Similarly  in recent times  as a result of changes on the international stage  free zone companies in the Dominican Republic  alongside those in Mexico and Central America  have been losing their competitive edge to Asian countries. This drop in competitiveness has resulted in the loss of jobs  production stagnation and a shortage of new investment.  Moreover  while the price of oil is rising  and with the prices of goods in the global economy fluctuating  we also find ourselves unexpectedly affected by price increases for food. All of a sudden we are surprised by the news that owing to the elimination of export subsidies in Europe  the price of milk has increased on the international market. The same has occurred  although for different reasons  with the cost of corn  soybeans and wheat as well as with other products that comprise the basic nutrition of the family. Because of the climbing prices of those products  the cost of chicken  turkey  bread and eggs have also risen.  As will be appreciated  we are facing a dangerous situation which could lead our people towards widespread famine and  consequently  a plunge into extreme poverty. Those factors have led to a vicious cycle that is spreading throughout the global food chain  while  in spite of the plea for free trade  producers in the world’s most powerful countries remain protected. As an example  while a United States  farmer has access to state-of-the-art farming equipment  the most modern facilities and technologically proficient staff  that farmer also receives government subsidies of approximately US $750 000 per year. Furthermore  the farmer might produce a pound of corn for a mere 7 cents.  At the same time  Félix David García Peña  also a corn farmer  who belongs to the Association of Farmers in San Juan de la Maguana in the southern part of the Dominican Republic near our border with Haiti  is struggling alone to make ends meet and to lead a decent life. His farming equipment is outdated. His tractor emits clouds of smoke every morning when he attempts to turn it on. His facilities are dilapidated. He receives no government subsidies since the Government is in no financial position to help him  and his production cost for one pound of corn is 12 cents  almost double the production cost of the subsidized United States farmer. When we asked Felix how we  as the Government  could help him  he stated  “I don’t want anything. All I want is fair trade to be able to sell my corn. The fact is that the challenges of globalization are having a marked impact on countries like the Dominican Republic. What we are experiencing is the interdependent character of current international trends. What seems to be a distant or remote event nevertheless has a direct impact on the daily lives of our peoples.  Another example that illustrates the undeniable interdependence of all nations on earth is climate change. That topic is not new to our discussions in this Organization  but with each year that passes we find ourselves closer to the predicted disasters.  In the Dominican Republic  we are already experiencing the impact of climate change in various ways: an increase in the volatility and frequency of floods  droughts and hurricanes that destroy our ecosystem  our biodiversity and our infrastructures. Also  we are experiencing increased coastal erosion and loss of beaches as well as frequent bleaching of our coral reefs  thus reducing our marine biodiversity and making tourism less attractive.  Given all those challenges presented by globalization  a country like the Dominican Republic asks itself: where is international solidarity  where is cooperation between peoples  how are we going to address together all of those challenges which affect most of the peoples of the world?  The truth is that there cannot be solidarity when there are those in the world who seek to accumulate wealth even while others suffer. There cannot be cooperation when there are people who think only of conducting business without taking into account the pain and anguish of others.  The United Nations system was created to promote solidarity and cooperation  and it is only fair to recognize that there is no other organization at the world level that has the prestige  capability and vocation of the Members of this world Organization. However  this grand forum of humanity  established after the enormous sacrifices of the Second World War  must also reform itself  if it intends to fulfil the ideals that inspired its creation  as enshrined in the Charter at the San Francisco Conference.  The current structure of the United Nations is no longer adequate today. The structure still corresponds to the cold-war period  even though humankind has advanced beyond an era when all events of importance were determined by the rivalry of two super-Powers.  Now  in the twenty-first century  we in the Dominican Republic do not truly comprehend why the President of the World Bank must be an American and the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund  a European and why major global decisions are the responsibility of only five countries.  As one of the founding Members of the United Nations  the Dominican Republic aspires to a position on the United Nations Security Council as a non-permanent member. In that position  we would strive to be a voice in favour of the weak  those without protection or shelter  the forsaken of the world. That is our sole aspiration. The Dominican Republic will uphold  responsibly and with conviction and determination  the values and principles the Organization has pledged to represent  as a beacon for peace  human dignity and the civilized coexistence of all inhabitants of the Earth. "
"49",2063,"DZA",62,2007,"I have  the particular pleasure of conveying to you  Sir  my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. This attests to the esteem and trust enjoyed by your country. Your unanimous election to your high office is also recognition of your ability and your wealth of experience as a talented academic and diplomat  which we believe will ensure success in the work of this session. I assure you of my delegation’s support and its full readiness to assist you in carrying out your lofty mission.  I should also like to thank Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her commendable efforts throughout the entirety of the previous session of the General Assembly. The measures she took are a further step towards modernizing the United Nations and improving its effectiveness.  I would also like to express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to tell him how pleased we are to see him participating in the work of the General Assembly as Secretary-General. By unanimously electing him to lead the Organization  we have demonstrated our confidence in his ability to continue the work of reforming the United Nations begun by his predecessor with a view to making the Organization an effective tool in achieving the noble objectives of promoting peace and development throughout the world. We should continue to support him in realizing that enormous and ambitious undertaking.  Gathered here at the General Assembly two years ago for the World Summit  our heads of State or Government took historic decisions for the future of the United Nations. Although we are pleased with the progress made to date  there is still a long way to go in achieving all the goals set at the Summit. Efforts must still be made to find the most appropriate response to the serious threat posed by climate change  which was the subject of discussion last week; achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); a comprehensive convention on international terrorism  which has still not been agreed; strengthening United Nations system-wide coherence; and reforming the Security Council  without which the overall reform process will remain incomplete. Algeria  which has always called for thorough and comprehensives reform of the Organization  continues to believe that decisive commitment and the widest possible endorsement by Member States are crucial to achieving the fruitful consensus to bring about a positive outcome of this ambitious reform effort.  The world today faces new types of destabilizing factors and numerous threats that jeopardize international peace and security. That is especially the case with regard to terrorism  which is by definition a threat to the basic right to life. It spares no region of the world and makes no distinction as to race  gender or religion. It therefore requires resolute international mobilization and a collective and decisive response based on solidarity from the international community. Only in that way can we ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the effort.  My country has long suffered from heinous terrorism  which we have fought on our own and for which we paid a great price due to the indifference of the international community in the 1990s. We therefore appreciate the daily growing awareness of the dangers posed by that phenomenon and of the need to prevent and eradicate it. In that regard  Algeria supported the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  which was adopted by the General Assembly in September 2006 as resolution 60/288. We call for a commitment by Member States to implement it immediately. We would like to point out  however  that the fight against terrorism should not be waged solely through the use of force but should also entail addressing the underlying causes of the phenomenon  in particular by finding just and equitable solutions to conflicts  especially the conflict in the Middle East.   In addition to expeditious measures to thwart this devastating phenomenon  it is also urgent to conclude a comprehensive convention against international terrorism that includes a clear definition of the concept of terrorism. Such a convention should also clearly de-link terrorism from the legitimate struggle of peoples against occupation. It should also not equate terrorism with any religion  civilization or geographic region.  In a world torn by conflict and tormented by extremism and intolerance of all sorts  it is essential today that we work to calm hearts and minds in order to promote a productive dialogue among cultures and civilizations  so as to dispel misunderstanding  eliminate prejudices and stereotypes and strengthen mutual understanding. With patience  determination and solidarity  we should dispel all theories and associations that promote the dangerous discourse of a clash of civilizations.  We have great hopes for the General Assembly’s forthcoming High-Level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace. We hope that the dialogue will serve to bring rationality to debates surrounding this issue  in line with the ambitious efforts of the Alliance of Civilization. Algeria is pleased at the particular attention given to this issue  including the appointment of Mr. Jorge Sampaio as High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations. We will spare no effort to promote this approach  which is more crucial than ever  to achieve a productive dialogue among civilizations that makes it possible for us to address such common challenges as underdevelopment  ignorance  poverty  racism and extremism.   Despite the Organization’s laudable efforts  the task of decolonization remains unfinished. I would like to refer in particular to Western Sahara  which is the last case of decolonization in Africa. Its people are still deprived the right to self-determination enshrined in the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. The international community had harboured genuine hope for a just and lasting resolution of the conflict  especially in the wake of the Security Council's unanimous support for the peace plan proposed by Mr. James Baker  former Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General  a plan that resolution 1495 (2003) rightly referred to as an “optimum political solution” (para. 1).   We are resolutely committed to the search for a peaceful solution under international law. Algeria welcomed the adoption on 30 April 2007 of Security Council resolution 1754 (2007)  which clearly emphasized the need to find a just and lasting political solution which will provide for the right of self-determination of the Saharawi people. We hope that the negotiations that began in June and resumed in August at New York will continue  in order to allow the two parties   Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO   to reach an agreement in line with international law that makes it possible for the people of Western Sahara to decide their own fate freely and without constraints in a referendum on self-determination.  Other tragedies are taking place in Africa: fratricidal wars  pandemics and natural disasters. This tragic situation only serves to push countries with limited resources into a precarious situation that diminishes the possibility of socio-economic development of any kind.  Although  from its inception in 2004 the Peace and Security Council of the African Union (AU) has been providing appropriate African solutions to conflicts on the continent  and as commendable as those have been  its efforts will not be effective without the firm commitment and considerable sustained assistance of the entire international community   such as the tremendous efforts made recently to resolve the crisis in Darfur. Effectively addressing the multidimensional problems involving peace  security and development faced by the continent today also requires that the international community support the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  which is a viable vehicle to address Africa’s socio-economic concerns.  In the Middle East  which is another especially unstable part of the world  the situation is deteriorating. This is reflected in daily violence and recurring crises. If we are not vigilant  that situation threatens to undermine any hope of establishing lasting peace in the region. The international community must once again become more involved in order to establish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East that is based on the implementation of the Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative. In that regard  Algeria welcomes the renewed attention being given to the Arab Peace Initiative  as reflected in President Bush’s proposal to hold an international peace conference this fall. The international community should support that effort  which has rekindled hope for a comprehensive resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict  in order to avert failure  which would have enormous consequences for international peace and security.  The situation in Iraq also continues to be of concern. That fraternal country is experiencing scenes of deadly violence on a daily basis. Sectarian and communal violence also prevails throughout the country  which undermine the values of citizenship and coexistence among the children of a single people. Those events appeal to our collective conscience and call on us to mobilize assistance to that country by making our contribution to finding a solution that preserves Iraq’s national unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity.  I should also like to express my country’s concern about the current impasse in the multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation process: the failure of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) held in May 2005 and the impasse at the 2005 World Summit on this issue. This is a matter that calls on us to act  for it is of crucial importance to the future of humankind. My country continues to believe that complying with the NPT entails the comprehensive and equitable implementation of all its provisions  ensuring a balance between the rights and obligations of States parties. The three fundamental pillars of the Treaty must be inseparable and complementary. Moreover  the goal of preventing nuclear proliferation should not be a pretext for preventing developing countries from having access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  On the basis of that deeply held belief  on 9 January 2007 Algeria was host to the first African high-level regional conference on the theme of nuclear energy’s contribution to peace and sustainable development. The goal was to translate into action the common African concern to ensure that nuclear energy serves to promote peace and sustainable development on the continent.  The issue of development has always been at the core of the international community’s concerns. In that regard  it is extremely important that it continue to be a very high priority for the Organization. In the light of the September 2000 Millennium Summit and the follow-up meetings held both under the auspices of the United Nations and outside the system  it is clear that the issue of development has become one of the major challenges   such as peace  with which it is inextricably linked   that the international community must address. In that connection  African heads of State  who launched NEPAD  and the leaders of the Group of Eight (G8) met last June at Heiligendamm  Germany  and took up the issue of peace and development in Africa as part of the agenda of that meeting. My country welcomes the decision taken by the G8 to provide $60 billion in assistance to combat AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis and other pandemics in Africa.   Implementing that decision   and the progress made in other areas  such as in effectively liberalizing international trade   should be important steps towards achieving the development goals set by the international community. To that end  we believe that it is essential that the entire international community   and developed countries in particular   becomes more involved and honour the commitments undertaken at the 2000 Millennium Summit  the 2002 Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development  the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development and the 2005 World Summit.  In that regard  we are pleased to note that there were a number of encouraging signs during the high-level dialogue on climate change held at the United Nations last week. That illustrates that there is now a collective awareness of the reality of the threat to humankind posed by climate change and of its correlation with the issue of development. In that connection  I would like to emphasize the central role that should be played by the United Nations in carrying out negotiations in advance of the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  which is to be held in Bali  so as to ensure that the meeting produces a global regime to replace the Kyoto Protocol upon its expiry  in 2012. That regime should include an emissions reduction strategy that is fair  effective and equitable and based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. In essence  it is a matter of safeguarding the interests of developing countries  especially African countries  which pollute the least but are the most exposed to the effects of climate change.  We are determined to continue our active participation in the international effort to protect the environment. Algeria has made its energy strategy part of its sustainable development policy by deciding to promote renewable sources of energy.   I am also pleased to note that  on 5 June 2006  Algeria had the distinct honour of hosting the festivities for World Environment Day. In addition  from 17 to 19 December 2006  we hosted the Joint International Conference on Desertification  which was held to mark the end of the International Year of Deserts and Desertification  an issue which is linked to that of climate change.  Algeria has embraced the Millennium Declaration and has spared no effort to take concrete steps through its national development policies. We are also working within the context of NEPAD to promote all efforts that will contribute to development on the African continent.   Consolidating domestic reforms by strengthening democracy and the rule of law as important elements of good governance stems from our desire to modernize our country  economy and society. In that vein  Algeria has voluntarily agreed to peer review under the African evaluation Mechanism established for that purpose. That undertaking is part of Africa’s efforts to contribute concretely to strengthening good governance in every country of Africa  and in the continent as a whole.   A report was presented to heads of States members of the African Peer Review Mechanism meeting at Accra in June 2007. Among other things  the report underscored Algeria’s great socio-economic progress. It also welcomed the steps that have been taken to achieve national reconciliation  which were the result of a courageous and visionary political decision taken by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika that has now been realized through a popular referendum that reaffirmed a very broad-based desire for reconciliation.  In conclusion  allow me to point out that in 2005  when we commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  we charted a course to undertake genuine reorganization in the architecture of international relations by adapting the Organization to the world we live in today. Only an Organization that is effective  just and credible will be able to meet the demands brought about by change and to rise to the challenges produced by the turbulence of today’s world in order to ensure peace  security and development for future generations. That is Algeria's firm conviction  as well as that of the entire international community."
"50",2110,"ECU",62,2007,"Allow me  to begin my statement by recalling the commitment to fight poverty  in force since September 2000  when 189 countries signed the Millennium Declaration  which included the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). On that agreement we undertook to meet by 2015 some basic goals on the path of human development.  Today  from a Government that has declared in Ecuador a citizens' revolution  one that is democratic  ethical and nationalist  we wish to set out some critical thoughts with regard to the very concept of the MDGs  their limitations and the dangers that minimum programmes of that nature entail  in particular with regard to the profound social and economic inequalities that exist on the planet.  The first limitation of the MDGs is that they constitute a minimum as a poverty-reducing strategy. Our goal is to go much further than such minimums by going into greater depth on those objectives and incorporating others. The fact that we subscribe exclusively to a focus on minimum needs  such as that presented in the MDGs  carries a high risk that in seeking to satisfy our consciences we limit the aspirations for social change.  I think it is fair to say that there are two thresholds by which we can characterize the lives of people. The first has to do with the indispensable abilities of human beings to survive within a society and without which life could not be called human. The second refers to the capacities that allow each individual to be fulfilled within that society. We are speaking not only about subsistence  but of the right to enjoy a life that is worthy of living.  Ecuador believes that to have the goal of living on $1 plus 1 cent per day in order to supposedly overcome extreme poverty or to avoid dying prematurely  as one might deduce from the MDGs — does not lead to a dignified life. The development of public policies in a country that is attempting to bring about radical change - as is the case in Ecuador - cannot be satisfied with those minimum objectives. Obviously  avoiding the premature death of girls and boys or of pregnant women is an objective that nobody would question. However  if we base ourselves only on that  we run the risk of agreeing that human life is simply a process of resistance  the aim of which is to extend someone's existence by a few more hours.  What we propose therefore are common goals  not only with regard to living minimums but with regard to social maximums as well. For example  we feel that it is possible to draw on diverse identities  to build and restore public areas  to guarantee access to justice and to have work which enables people to enjoy the right to support themselves and to have time for contemplation  artistic creation and recreation — goals that are already contained in the national development plan that is being implemented by the Government of Ecuador.   Accordingly  we renounce the idea of a historically inevitable present to which we must surrender by simply looking for minimums that are clearly basic. Furthermore  to be satisfied with the minimum also means - and that is very serious - legitimizing the reality that we experience because the minimum will not alter the distance and power relationships between individuals and between societies. Hence  we also favour the recognition of equal dignity for all human beings. Granting some people certain minimums must be an initial and temporary goal and must never be considered a modus operandi of public policy. For that means that the “beneficiary” is placed in a position of inferiority compared to everyone else. In other words  it means that their dignity is not recognized as equal with everyone else's. In fact  it is no accident that international bureaucracies such as the World Bank always suggest producing poverty reports  but never consider publishing inequality reports.  For this reason  perhaps the best way to reduce poverty with dignity is to reduce social  economic  territorial  environmental and cultural gaps. One of my Government's main goals is thus to reduce inequality in an endogenous development framework of economic inclusion and socio-territorial cohesion  domestically as well as within the global system. And along the same lines  we in Ecuador are seeking to apply the rule of human rights and universal values. On the other hand  the long and sad neoliberal night proposed -  from an existential perspective with its consequent absolutism of the market - social programmes that ended up by breaking up society into as many parts as there are social groups.   However  a national plan and a change in the power relationships within a society do not mean that all the fragments will come together. There is no claim that  by some twist of fate  these will acquire meaning and coherence and will assemble themselves like the pieces of a puzzle - even if some of the pieces are missing. It is indispensable to have a common plan that must be constantly redesigned and whose goal must be that we all want to be part of it.  That is why  in Ecuador  we are creating our national development plan in a democratic fashion. We know that without everyone's participation in society's basic decisions  no country can legitimize its public decision-making and make it more efficient. We must change a political practice employed by the traditional sectors  with their technocrats and elites  and return speech and action to those who should be the owners  protagonists and beneficiaries of public policy.   I would like furthermore to point out that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) offer a vision of development that is linked to consumption and a strategy linked to processes of economic liberalization. Our view on development is very different from that. We understand development to be the attainment of a good standard of living for everyone  in peace and in harmony with nature  and with the indefinite extension of human cultures. In that respect  we are extremely happy to see that the Assembly has broadly debated the devastating and unjust effects of climate change.   Ecuador has submitted a specific and innovative proposal to contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and to the preservation of biodiversity: our Yasuni-ITT proposal. It involves a commitment not to extract some 920 million barrels of oil  thereby avoiding the emission of approximately 111 million tons of carbon that would come from the burning of this fossil fuel. However  that will mean that we will have to forgo significant investments of around $720 million each year  a very significant amount for the economy of Ecuador.   We are prepared to make this huge sacrifice  but we also ask for shared responsibility on the part of the international community  particularly on the part of developed countries  the planet's main predators  and for a minimum compensation for the environmental benefits that we are generating. That would be an extraordinary example of global collective action  setting aside rhetoric in favour of concrete facts and practical actions: not only would it reduce global warming for the benefit of the whole planet  but it would also bring about a new way of thinking about economics in the twenty-first century  where the generation of value is compensated  not just the generation of goods.  Speaking of cultures  we were very happy to see that the General Assembly recently adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (resolution 61/295)  which was sponsored very actively by Ecuador. The Declaration is an instrument that had to wait more than 20 years to be adopted and that will be the fundamental charter for the protection of human rights of our indigenous peoples.  Finally  the good living that we are talking about presupposes that genuine individual freedoms  opportunities and potentials be enhanced. An immoral paradox arises here: at the world level  we are promoting the free movement of goods and capital  looking for the highest profitability. But  on the other hand  we are penalizing the free circulation of people who are looking for decent jobs. That is quite simply intolerable and absolutely unsustainable from an ethical point of view.   For the Government of Ecuador  there are no illegal human beings. There is no such thing  and the United Nations must insist on this point. There is no such person as an illegal human being. It is not permissible to think in that way. We are working actively to bring about changes in the shameful international migration policies  particularly those of the countries of the so-called first world  without forgetting  of course  that our greatest responsibility is to build a country that will guarantee decent life as a way of preventing forced exodus because of poverty and exclusion.   We must not be misled by those who proclaim the end of ideologies and the end of history. Conservatives want to make us believe that we live in the best of all possible worlds and that we have to abandon any attempt at change  any attempt to build our own individual and collective identity  any attempt to build our own history. In the face of such a miserly and self-satisfied worldview  we say that it is possible to have  collective action that is both aware and democratic  in order to direct our lives and organize world society in a different way with a more human face. Our understanding of development obliges us to recognize one another  understand one another and appreciate one another  so that we can move towards self-realization and the building of a shared future. Ecuador invites the Assembly to build this world  this dream.  "
"51",2155,"EGY",62,2007,"Six  years ago  in September 2001  we  the representatives of the international community  stood united and in solidarity in the face of international terrorism. In all our languages  faiths and cultures  we expressed our condemnation of any terrorist act that targets innocent civilians. We denounced and deplored such acts  then resolved to work seriously to combat this grave and alarming phenomenon. We agreed to work earnestly  not only to deal with terrorism from a security perspective  but also to achieve long-awaited breakthroughs in the old crises and conflicts  which because of their complexity and longevity have overwhelmed the desperate and the hopeless in our particular region. Those conflicts fuel people’s sense of injustice and despair and push them into the ranks of those who espouse dark extremist ideas that consider violence as the only means of operation and even sometimes as an end in itself.  We were all prepared for action. There was a widespread belief in the Middle East region that major breakthroughs were imminent  that the successful containment and eradication of international terrorism would take place not only through security operations but also through concurrent actions of equal importance aimed at draining its intellectual resources and freezing its human and financial assets.  However  we seem to have gone astray during those six years. Our objectives were fragmented  and our energies were scattered. We failed as an international community to maintain the huge momentum generated in this very Hall in September 2001  that momentum which found expression in our resolve to work together to defuse tensions in our region as a step towards the settlement of its chronic political conflicts.  Regrettably  narrow-minded  domestic political agendas have been imposed by some  and unwise objectives have replaced the lofty ones that we had planned to achieve. Instead of focusing on the eradication of the hotbeds of international terrorism   hotbeds which were not numerous six years ago   we lost sight of our main goal and vision. The eradication of international terrorism was no longer the goal but instead became a loose phrase. There was oppression  torture and humiliation  and  on the other side  more violence  resistance and atrocities.  This came as no surprise to us  since the objective was regrettably lost. We all stood stunned and flabbergasted before the events that were unfolding in this region and the world. How could we have been diverted from our goal? How could it be that our world was dragged down almost to the level of a clash between civilizations  cultures and religions? Why are some attempting to thrust the holy religion of Islam into the labyrinth of a limitless clash with the West  a clash that serves no one’s interests? To the contrary  it causes everyone grievous harm. Here comes the question: what can we  the national people of the world  do to get back on course?  In all honesty  I must tell you that this last question is our main concern in the Middle East. Despite the importance of the other questions  and even though we are fully aware of the answers thereto  we prefer to leave aside these questions and to let the historians and scholars probe them  detect any errors and assign historical responsibility to each party.  But in truth the more urgent task is to get back on course by finding a way out of the dark tunnel we have been forced into. In our opinion  the right way to proceed is to go back to where we should have started from in the first place and to address directly and effectively the chronic conflicts  foremost among them being the Arab-Israeli conflict and its core issue  the Palestinian question.  Any attempt to achieve stability and disseminate peace and security in the world without a serious settlement of the Palestinian question and the Arab-Israeli conflict will not be successful. The opposite is also true. Serious and sustained action to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement of that conflict and that question directly serves international peace and security and contributes to the stabilization of the Middle East region. All of us are aware of the importance of Middle East stability for the stability of the world at large. Furthermore  we are duty-bound to continue our work to defuse tensions in Iraq and Lebanon and to stabilize and improve the situation in Darfur.  It is hard to believe that sixteen years have already passed since the convening of the historic Madrid Peace Conference between the Arabs and Israel. Fourteen years have elapsed since the signing of the first Palestinian-Israeli accord in Oslo. Eleven years ago  Arab States adopted peace as their strategic option to end their conflict with Israel. Five full years have passed since the declaration by the Arab States of their historic initiative regarding their readiness to establish normal peace relations with Israel in return for the latter’s withdrawal from the territories it occupied by force in 1967 and for the just settlement of the Palestinian question. It has also been five years since the Palestinians and the Israelis reached a number of agreed points and memorandums that come very close to the final settlement of this question.  Given all of the above  one would scarcely believe that peace today still seems farther away than it was in the early 1990s. It is hard to believe that there is now talk going around in vicious circles about the bases and principles of the settlement  which are already known to all of us. It is also hard to believe that strenuous efforts are made to resume negotiations to agree yet again on mechanisms and formulations. Rehashing those old and worn-out subjects is an exercise in futility.  We in Egypt realize that the persistence of this conflict inflames passions and minds in the region. The Assembly knows the efforts and sacrifices made by Egypt in order to put a just and comprehensive end to this historic conflict in a manner that serves the interests of all parties.  But this issue requires leadership; it requires courage from all parties. It also requires a clear and correct vision that the lack of a peaceful settlement of this conflict not only denies the right of a whole people to freedom and dignity  but also feeds directly the calls for violence  extremism and the relinquishing of peaceful and political negotiation as a means to achieve the objective. Thus the conflict will continue to rage for years to come; peoples will continue to suffer; the world will continue to face the current state of sharp instability and polarization  as we are currently witnessing.  Egypt has displayed and continues to display its constant readiness to work with all parties: Palestinians  Israelis  Americans  Europeans and all those who take to heart the interests of the Palestinian people  the interests of the peoples of the region and the interest of world peace and stability. Our purpose is to achieve the resumption of serious political dialogue  which would lead to a settlement within a strict  specified time frame.   We will spare no effort to achieve that objective. We will not despair in the face of problems and difficulties. We will work in all sincerity because we are committed to the cause of our Palestinian brothers and to the establishment of an independent  sovereign Palestinian State on the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. We will continue to work because we are committed to the liberation of the rest of the occupied Arab territories in Syria and Lebanon and because we are committed to the objective of achieving just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. In this respect  the meeting called for by President Bush this fall may  if well prepared  provide an important opportunity to achieve long-awaited progress.  Brotherly Iraq continues to bleed; thousands of its citizens continue to be killed; thousands more continue to flee as a result of difficult living conditions. The state of today’s Iraq breaks the heart of one and all. In spite of the political process in Iraq  which we understood and encouraged  events on the ground  with their extremely negative repercussions  are what shapes today’s Iraq and its image before the international community.   Iraq today sorely needs leaders and leaderships that are keen on preserving the unity of this major Arab country. It needs leaders who seek consensus and steer away from sectarianism and confessionalism. It needs leaders who extend the hand of dialogue to each other  who do not point guns at one another: it needs leaders who close ranks to combat the illegal armed factions and militias that take the lives of dozens of Iraqis everyday. It needs leaders who would sit together to agree on the shape and future of the State of Iraq in the Iraqi Constitution  which we believe should express the hopes and dreams of all Iraqis without exclusion or marginalization. It should build a modern developed State that is enriched by its diversity and that does not allocate its posts on the basis of sect or ethnic background in a manner that causes tension and increases discord.  Egypt reiterates the importance of the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq in a manner that enjoys the consensus of all Iraqis. We also reiterate the need for foreign interventions to cease influencing developments in that sisterly country. Egypt reaffirms its full support for any regional or international effort that assists Iraqis to overcome this difficult situation. By the same token  Egypt will continue to consistently call upon Iraqis to show unity and engage in dialogue in order to restore and strengthen trust among them.  Brotherly Lebanon is also going through a sensitive crisis. The prospects for settling that crisis seem remote and difficult in view of internal differences and the regional tug-of-war. The situation in Lebanon is delicate and must not be burdened by the weight of the conflicts raging in the region. Therefore  Egypt has consistently called for Lebanon to be left to its people to determine what they wish for themselves. We continue to encourage Lebanon’s politicians to engage in dialogue among themselves. It is our hope that they will be able to deal with the upcoming entitlements  foremost and most important among which are the presidential elections  in a manner consistent with the Lebanese Constitution and that would enable them to preserve Lebanon’s constitutional institutions and the proud achievements of its democracy. The Lebanese model of coexistence is significant and should not be allowed to suffer a setback similar to that suffered in the past. Egypt will work with all parties to achieve that objective.  Since the onset of its crisis  the Darfur region of Sudan has witnessed difficult conditions. This has required time  effort and hard work from all of us to defuse that crisis and to reach a settlement that would ensure for the whole population of the region the right to a decent life. Egypt welcomed the broad concern of the international community over those difficult conditions and sought  in cooperation with concerned international and regional parties  to bring the parties in the crisis close to each other.   As concrete proof of its concern for the stabilization of the situation in Darfur  Egypt has offered a generous contribution of nearly 3 500 troops to the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in the region. That offer still stands. In addition  Egypt has contributed to the development of the region by drilling 40 boreholes that would make water resources available to larger numbers of people in Darfur.  Egypt profoundly believes in the three main pillars of international disarmament treaties:  non-proliferation  disarmament and the inherent right of every State to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In 1995  Egypt accepted the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons within an integrated package that included a resolution calling upon all States of the region without exception  to accede to the Treaty and compelling those States responsible for the maintenance of international security to discharge their responsibilities. However  this objective is still to be achieved because Israel has not yet acceded to the Treaty despite all the international and regional calls on it to do so.  Today’s world is regrettably witnessing an imbalance and double standards in dealings with the various parties that have nuclear ambitions  potential or expertise. Egypt believes that the international disarmament and non-proliferation system will be strengthened and that regional security in the Middle East will be reinforced only when a single standard is applied equally to all the States of the region without exception.  The previous session witnessed many serious efforts and consultations concerning the question of the reform and expansion of the Security Council. Despite the plethora of consultations  meetings and endeavours  this objective remains elusive. As a member of the African Group  Egypt once again states its full commitment to the specifics of the unified African position. It remains a fair and balanced position that would  if implemented  achieve legitimate African aspirations. I cannot fail to refer here to the fact that the reform of the working methods of the Security Council is a genuine objective in itself that must not fade or be obscured by the attempts of some to expand the Council.  We have plenty of work to do  but since time is short I would like to say that the state of our world is no cause for rejoicing. Rather it is a cause for concern. This requires us to work together with open minds in order to change it for the better  and in order to meet the aspirations of our peoples to freedom  justice  a dignified life  security and peace.  During this session  Egypt will raise and defend the priorities and visions I have put forward in this statement along with a host of other subjects that time did not allow me to address. It is our hope that we will all write in responding to the challenges facing us. We all bear responsibility and will all suffer the consequences of failure. "
"52",2179,"ERI",62,2007,"Allow me to extend my  congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I would also like to recognize Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain for her distinguished service as President of the Assembly at its sixty-first session.  Please allow me also to extend my appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his strong commitment and unceasing efforts in addressing issues of peace and security in many parts of the world where many conflicts and tensions remain unresolved. I wish to assure him of my Government’s constructive support and its wholehearted commitment to peace and security in our region.   This session of the General Assembly provides Member States with the opportunity to address the challenges and threats that continue to preoccupy us  including the lack of peace and security and the presence of extreme poverty  underdevelopment  environmental degradation and natural disasters.   In the interest of brevity  let me now revert to more pressing problems closer to home. For the past five years  it has  sadly  become almost a ritual for my Government to urge  from this rostrum  the international community  and especially the Security Council  to shoulder their fundamental responsibilities for the maintenance of peace and security in our part of the world. The legal principles at stake and the looming threat to regional peace and stability have been and remain stark indeed. The hard facts are neither controversial nor ambiguous.   In flagrant breach of international law  the Charter of the United Nations and the Algiers Peace Agreement  Ethiopia continues to occupy sovereign Eritrean territories through military force. Ethiopia continues to reject the final and binding decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) and to obstruct the demarcation of the boundary  to which end the international community has deployed the United Nations Mission in Eritrea and Ethiopia (UNMEE) at an annual running cost about $200 million. Ethiopia continues to violate with impunity fundamental principles of international law  including full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a fellow United Nations Member State  the integrity of international treaties and the norms of settling disputes through binding arbitration. Those are the indelible facts on the ground that have been and are spawning a climate of permanent and escalating tension in our part of the world.  Throughout these years  the Boundary Commission has filed no less than 24 reports to the Security Council underlining the gravity of the situation. The EEBC has no independent means or powers of enforcement. The legal authority and powers of enforcement reside  squarely and explicitly  with the Security Council  which is the guarantor of the Algiers Peace Agreement. As such  the United Nations Security Council should long have taken remedial action  both in accordance with Article 14 of the Algiers Peace Agreement as well as on the basis of Article 39 of the United Nations Charter. But that has not happened to date. Ethiopia has managed to frustrate the EEBC decision and the demarcation of the boundary   which should have been completed by 2003   because of the unwarranted positions of some United Nations Security Council member States  and especially the United States of America  which has regrettably chosen to placate Ethiopia at the expense of international law and the interests of regional peace and security.  It was against the backdrop of Ethiopia’s defiance and violation of international law that the Boundary Commission convened a meeting of the parties in The Hague early last month. Ethiopia first sought to prevent the meeting from taking place by raising spurious legal objections to the original venue   New York. And when that bogus pretext was removed and the meeting was convened in The Hague  Ethiopia failed to respond to the five conditions that the Commission had imposed so that it could proceed and embark on the time-bound schedule of operations that had been worked out in order to complete pillar emplacements along the 1000 kilometre border in the coming months. The five conditions that Ethiopia was requested to fulfil were: first  to indicate its unqualified acceptance of the 2002 Delimitation Decision without requiring broader ranging negotiations between the parties; secondly  to lift restrictions on the movement of EEBC personnel; thirdly  to provide security assurances; fourthly  to meet payment arrears and fifthly  to allow free access to pillar locations.  At the Commission’s meeting  Eritrea committed itself once again to cooperate with the demarcation in all of the respects regarding which the Commission had expressed concern. Eritrea’s commitments were made both in writing and verbally  in front of the Commission and other participants.  Eritrea asks merely that Ethiopia make the same commitment to support the demarcation in accordance with the Commission’s legitimate instructions. Ethiopia  however  made it clear that it had no intention of complying with the Commission’s demarcation instructions and raised tangential issues  which my delegation has fully addressed in the full text of my statement.   After the recent Boundary Commission meeting in early September in The Hague   which I mentioned   the text of a letter came to Eritrea’s attention. The letter had been circulated to the public and the media without communicating it to the Eritrean Government through appropriate diplomatic or legal channel. In the letter the Ethiopian Foreign Minister indicated Ethiopia’s intention to attempt to renounce the two Algiers Agreements in accordance with which the Eritrea-Ethiopia border war of 1998-2000 was brought to an end.   The substance of Ethiopia’s letter and its timing underscored the fact that the letter was intended simply as another effort to subvert the implementation of the final and binding award of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission. As such  that effort is clearly unlawful under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and other principles of international law  as well as highly detrimental to regional peace and security.  The Vienna Convention does not support Ethiopia’s effort to deny legal force to the Commission’s award. Even if Ethiopia’s renunciation attempts were legally effective   which they are  not   Article 70 of the Convention states that the boundary established under the Algiers Agreement remains binding on both parties.  The Vienna Convention cannot simply be interpreted to permit the dissatisfied party in a boundary arbitration to renounce the result retroactively. Indeed  Ethiopia seems to be planning to use its unlawful attempt to renounce the Algiers Agreements in order to renew hostilities. The Algiers Agreements were designed to put an end once and for all to the two States’ conflicting claims to territory and thus to leave the two States free to rebuild their relationship for the good of both of their peoples.   In the five and one half years since the Boundary Commission’s delimitation decision  however  Ethiopia has repeatedly obstructed implementation of the decision and threatened to walk out on the process altogether  if it was not given everything that it wanted. While tens of thousands of Eritreans indigenous to the Ethiopian-occupied regions wait in internally displaced persons camps for the chance to peacefully enjoy the benefits of the final and binding award  Ethiopia is moving new settlers onto their land  attempting to make its illegal occupation of Eritrean territory permanent. That is in breach of the Algiers Agreements  in particular the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities  and Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter should have been invoked to end Ethiopia’s flagrant violations with impunity of international law.   Eritrea sincerely hopes that the demarcation process can be restarted  in accordance with international law and consistent with the final and binding delimitation award of 13 April 2002. This is the central tenet of the Algiers Agreements and the key to reinstating regional harmony. It is important for effective action to be taken in the interest of legality and the maintenance of regional peace and security. The United Nations and the Security Council have unequivocal legal and moral responsibilities to ensure that this occurs without further delay and some Powers with major interests in the region need to reassess their policies so that the peoples in the region can live in peace and harmony.  Ethiopia’s invasion of Somalia has become a serious concern in our region  and the Security Council and members of the international community must insist on the unconditional and immediate withdrawal of all Ethiopian troops from Somalia in order to end the occupation.  I do not wish to conclude my statement without briefly touching on the progress and the challenges that lie ahead in the peace process in the Sudan. The Sudan has come a long way in addressing its internal conflicts  both by concluding peace agreements and by engaging in the implementation process of the terms and conditions of the peace accords. Eritrea will continue to lend its support to the peace process in Darfur by working closely with all concerned parties and countries  including the United Nations and the African Union  in order to achieve a robust peace package that will bring a lasting solution. In that regard  Eritrea looks forward to the Tripoli meeting later this month. "
"53",2225,"ESP",62,2007,"Mr. President  at the outset I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. It is a great pleasure for me to address the General Assembly for the third time in order to take stock of the actions of the international community and to express commitment and share our thoughts regarding the priorities on our agenda.  When this world forum was created six decades ago  it was an expression of will and necessity; out of will came commitment and out of necessity came awareness. The States represented here today are more committed and are more conscious than ever of the need to advance in establishing peace  combating poverty  protecting human rights  and furthering democracy and international law.   In our complex and uncertain world new and old challenges  new and old conflicts exist simultaneously. Our cooperation has improved in quality  but poverty continues to affect a large sector of the world’s population. We are moving forward in promoting and protecting human rights  but gross violations persist. We seek peace  prosperity and dignity for all. What measures and instruments do we have to meet these challenges? How can we adapt them in order to respond more effectively?   Today  we know that no State alone can effectively address the global agenda and guarantee human development in a world that is increasingly uncertain and interdependent   though no less stimulating and creative for that. The means exist at the universal  regional and bilateral levels  as well as at the level of our many interrelationships. The structures and organizations that the international community has built with so much effort form a complex framework that we must reform  strengthen and update. Spain promotes effective multilateralism inspired by values and principles sustained by the people. The international community recognizes the need for a greater political consensus and effective cooperation  a trend seen within the United Nations system as well as in regional structures such as the European Union (EU)  the Iberoamerican Community of Nations  or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Spain participates in those organizations  where optimism on progress is tangible. Despite the sometimes slow pace of progress  there is a global political awareness of the challenges affecting demography  sustainable human and economic development and their link to climate change.  Peace is possible and necessary   real peace  not just the absence of war. We need to clear the way for peace and political reason in the Middle East  a region fraught with violence and dramatic tension  which in turn affects the security and confidence of the international community. We must choose the power of words over that of arms  trust over mistrust  commitment over fear and dialogue and effective concerted action over disagreement. Spain wishes to help the parties and joins with the Quartet and its representative in seeking a final solution. In order to do this  we must establish an open dialogue without preconditions and draw renewed inspiration from the Madrid Conference. For peace to be complete  it must include Syria and Lebanon.   The meeting proposed by President Bush is an appropriate occasion to formalize everyone’s commitment to this desired peace. Spain unreservedly supports that initiative.   We wish for a peaceful  viable and democratic Palestinian State  living in peace with Israel  and an Israel that is secure and has good relations in its region. The international community must support and assist parties in their efforts. Spain is firmly determined to make its contribution effective.  Spain’s commitment in the region is also demonstrated by its participation in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). I truly hope that the Lebanese political forces will reach a consensus resolution of their political crisis without interference. I appeal for a political agreement in the name of peace  in the national interest of Lebanon and in the interest of the region.  The conflict in Western Sahara is one of the main obstacles to the integration process of the Arab Maghreb Union. We are actively committed to seeking a just and final political agreement that respects the principle of self-determination within the framework of the United Nations. Spain trusts that with the assistance of the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy and the support of friendly nations  all parties will make progress and that the direct negotiations that have already been initiated will culminate in an agreement.  Constructive trust is fundamental  and that was behind the dialogue forum on Gibraltar in which important agreements were reached on matters of local cooperation of benefit to all. Spain hopes to make progress in reaching a final solution to the sovereignty dispute in accordance with the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations.   We have seen uneven progress in conflicts with a history of devastation and violence. We have also seen progress and change in conflicts that had been deadlocked  such as those in Georgia  Nagorny Karabakh and Transdniestria  as well as in that relating to the status of Kosovo.   Peace is possible and necessary  and we are moving towards it despite being hit by terrorism  which poses a serious threat to peace and security. This global violence aims at undermining the stability of free and democratic societies and  as we agreed a year ago in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288)  we must prevail over that violence by coordinating our efforts and responding collectively. We are pleased that  in our determination to defeat terrorism  victims and their families have not been forgotten  and that the international community continues to urge respect for them. I believe that this is a well deserved acknowledgement and that without it the strategy against global terrorism would be incomplete.  Spain participates in peacekeeping operations authorized and mandated by the Security Council  in Lebanon  Afghanistan and the Balkans. Allow me  here in the General Assembly  to express my gratitude to the Spanish armed forces  the State security forces and others engaged in cooperative efforts for their work and solidarity in favour of peace. In particular  I pay heartfelt tribute to those Spaniards who have lost their lives in this effort and to their families and friends; only four days ago two Spanish soldiers died in Afghanistan. To assist in the logistics of peacekeeping operations  Spain has offered to establish a United Nations support base in Quart de Poblet in Valencia. A communications centre will be established there for the development of peacekeeping operations on the ground.  It is possible to defeat poverty. It is an ethical and political duty  a duty that Spain is firmly determined to shoulder. I am pleased and proud to say that my country today is the eighth-largest contributor to the United Nations system; our goal is to devote 0.7 per cent of our gross domestic product to development aid by 2012. In only three years  backed by political and social consensus  we have reinforced cooperation and increased its volume   to nearly €4.5 billion this year. Spain has expressed profound solidarity with and commitment to the goals set forth in the alliance against hunger and poverty.   We want access to drinking water and sanitation to be a universally enjoyed right. Water will be the central theme at International Expo Zaragoza 2008. That event will give participating countries and visitors insights into the fundamental aspects of water in the twenty-first century  such as the environment  international cooperation and prospects for scientific  technological and economic management. I encourage and invite members to participate in the 2008 Zaragoza exposition on water and sustainable development.  Spain wishes to assist in the structural strengthening of the United Nations and believes that institutional and managerial reform taking account of global civil society inputs is a priority.  That comment  Mr. President  is intended to highlight the progress made on the Security Council issue at the sixty-first session of the General Assembly  during the mandate of your predecessor. It is essential for this very sensitive aspect of reform to be resolved through a political decision adopted by consensus  and not in haste.   We welcome the Human Rights Council as a forum to debate issues related to rights and freedoms. Spain reiterates its trust in that body and its desire to become a member next year. The protection and promotion of human rights is a fundamental pillar of Spain’s foreign policy  because we are convinced that the violation of these rights leads to oppression and violence. We hope for the adoption at this session of a draft resolution on the abolition of the death penalty or  at the very least  on a universal moratorium.  The Alliance of Civilizations will mobilize the international community and global civil society to end the risk of polarization caused by the prejudices  erroneous ideas and extremism that can disrupt peaceful coexistence. Mr. Jorge Sampaio  the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  has presented an implementation plan programme  and a trust fund for voluntary contributions has been set up with the support of the Group of Friends  involving more than 70 States and international organizations.  This has been a good year for Spain  and we would like to share it with the international community. Our presence abroad has increased due to the active involvement of our citizens and our institutions  economic stability and business activity  all of which has been conducive to greater openness to the rest of the world. This is not the time to be discouraged; rather  it is a time for commitment and optimism. An objective and rational analysis of the progress that the international community has made in recent years should inspire hope and strengthen the will to work towards the development of a balanced agenda that addresses the challenges of our times. The States members of the General Assembly are more aware than ever that only through united action in solidarity can we meet these challenges effectively by using political dialogue  preventive diplomacy and public and humanitarian diplomacy. Spain sees the situation as positive. In that regard I would quote the Spanish poet Blas de Otero: “I ask for peace and I ask to speak ... in defence of man and his justice”. That means a commitment to action  not rhetoric. "
"54",2251,"EST",62,2007,"I shall speak today on four fundamental topics: climate change  cybersecurity  conflict resolution and cooperation among international organizations.  In accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  as well as the Kyoto Protocol  industrialized countries are obligated to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. Estonia has already achieved the basic target of the Kyoto Protocol: our emissions of greenhouse gases have been cut back by over 50 per cent. Fully subscribing to the European Union statement on the post-2012 vision for international climate  released by the Portuguese presidency  we hope that the negotiations concerning a new global climate deal will reach a new comprehensive and global political agreement by as early as December 2009.   Yes  we recognize that developing countries have special needs in the areas of sustainable economic growth and eradication of poverty. But we also need to decouple economic growth from energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Investing in energy efficiency will have a huge impact on our future. Diversification of the energy supply and greater use of renewable energies are the way forward.   The resources and the technology for decarbonisation come primarily from industrial nations. Therefore  we need to continue the dialogue between industrialized and developing nations concerning the adoption of a “green” economy  reducing carbon-fuel dependency and counterbalancing climate change caused by human activities. We need to promote technology transfer  which is necessary for developing environment-friendly energy production. Estonia believes that the best way forward is to tie development assistance to investment in clean technologies.  If in the past people were connected by sea lanes and trade routes  today we are ever more connected by the Internet  along with the threats that loom in cyberspace. Cyberattacks are a clear example of contemporary asymmetrical threats to security. They make it possible  with limited means and from a distance  to paralyse a society.   In the future  cyberattacks may  in the hands of criminals or terrorists or terrorist States  become a considerably more widespread and dangerous weapon than they are at present. Cyberattacks are a threat not only to sophisticated information technology systems  but also to communities as a whole. For example  they could be used to paralyse a city’s emergency medical services. The threats posed by cyberwarfare have often been underestimated  since  fortunately  they have not as yet resulted in the loss of any lives. Also  for security reasons  the details of cyberattacks are often not publicized.   In addition to taking concrete technical and legal measures to counter cyberattacks  Governments must morally define cyberviolence and cybercrime  which deserve to be generally condemned in the same way as terrorism and the trafficking in human beings are condemned. Fighting against cyberwarfare is in the interests of us all. It requires both appropriate domestic measures and international efforts.  In April and May of this year  my country  Estonia  coped successfully with an extensive cyberattack  and we are prepared to share with other countries the know-how that we have acquired. We call upon the international community to cooperate in legal matters in questions concerning cybersecurity. But  since this whole subject is in a relatively new field  it is essential to establish an appropriate legal space. As a first step  we call upon all countries to accede to the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe. The Convention is also open for accession by  non-members of the Council.  We should move ahead and create a truly international framework for combating these vicious acts. The Global Cybersecurity Agenda of the International Telecommunications Union  launched by the Secretary-General in May  is an important initiative for building international cooperation in this field. Estonia also agrees with the assessment of the specialists of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research that a globally negotiated and comprehensive cyberspace law is essential and that the United Nations can provide the neutral and legitimate forum necessary for that task.  The United Nations is determined to resolve conflicts. Understandably  conflict prevention and resolution  particularly in Africa  is a top priority. We welcome the creation of a United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force to quell the violence and instability plaguing the Darfur region of the Sudan.  It is important to settle conflicts in other places as well  such as Afghanistan. We need to increase the presence and visibility of the United Nations there  which would be an encouraging sign for the local population and would also send a signal to other international aid organizations and non-governmental organizations that they should increase their activities. The United Nations should also assume a greater role in coordinating the reconstruction effort in Afghanistan.  I would like to highlight one conflict in Europe in which the United Nations has a significant role to play: the conflict in Abkhazia  Georgia. Along with the other “frozen” conflicts in the neighbouring region  it remains among the last unresolved conflicts in Europe. It is my hope that the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General will have the determination to find solutions that honour Georgia’s territorial integrity. We cannot be satisfied with the current situation. It is important to build confidence between the parties and to resume the meetings between the representatives of Georgia’s Government and those of Abkhazia. There is no place for military provocations  internal or external.   A major task for the United Nations remains the facilitation of the return of refugees to Abkhazia  which  unfortunately  has been greatly hampered. Progress regarding the conflict is possible if all interested parties act in a constructive way. We must generate the political will necessary to resolve the conflict. In that context  I welcome the increased contribution of the European Union (EU).  The international community should also secure the best and most rational use of available resources  including in emergency and crisis response situations. For example  both the United Nations and the EU were involved in managing the response to the Asian tsunami in 2004 and the Lebanese crisis in 2006. That once again brought to the fore the necessity of developing common needs assessments   to further discuss the roles and mandates of the relevant actors  such as the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection of the EU.  Poverty  armed conflicts and natural disasters such as floods  tsunamis and forest fires are all causes of another global problem   forced migration  which should also be tackled in a more concerted manner by the whole international community. Being forced to leave one’s home is always a tragedy. I know: my family was forced to leave my country  fleeing brutal Soviet occupation forces. Trying to integrate into a new society is always a significant challenge. Only through well-coordinated common efforts can we ensure that people never again have to leave their homes because they have no other option. Thus  a global approach to human migration should remain a vital issue on the United Nations agenda. "
"55",2297,"ETH",62,2007,"Allow me to begin by congratulating you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I would like to assure you of my country’s fullest cooperation in the discharge of the responsibilities bestowed upon you. I have no doubt that this Assembly will benefit from both your personal and professional experience. May I take this opportunity to commend your predecessor  Ambassador Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her invaluable contributions and wise leadership during the Assembly’s previous session.  I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. He is already fully engaged and has made an excellent beginning in the efforts to address global challenges since he took office a year ago. I would therefore  on this occasion  like to underline Ethiopia’s firm commitment to cooperate in every way in assisting him in his demanding endeavours.  Just three weeks ago  Ethiopia began its third Millennium. This Assembly has recognized the Ethiopian Millennium as a world event. On 15 June 2007  it adopted resolution 61/270  designating the year from 12 September 2007 to 11 September 2008 as the year of the Ethiopian Millennium. The Assembly of the African Union also declared the Ethiopian Millennium as a part of African heritage and a unique occasion. We thank you all for that honour and for that expression of solidarity. Those who have witnessed how Ethiopians of all walks of life have received the new Ethiopian Millennium could not have missed the new spirit that has been on display in the country. This is a spirit of renewal and commitment to stand in unity for a better future for the country. The new Millennium was greeted by all Ethiopians with a pledge to do more for national harmony and for durable peace and stability and to prevail against the poverty that has been the hallmark of the country in recent decades.  Two thousand years ago  Ethiopia was the home of one of the great civilizations of the world  at Aksum. A thousand years ago  we could still produce two of the world’s greatest heritage sites. One is the city of Harar  the fourth holiest city of Islam  which by happy coincidence also celebrates its own millennium this year. The other is the city of churches built by Lalibela  a saint  priest and emperor in the town that still bears his name today.  But Ethiopia’s fortune began to change  commencing in the second half of the last Millennium. Though a survivor of colonialism and a representative of the greatness of Africa’s past  Ethiopia also unfortunately came to represent and symbolize the poverty  dearth and destitution of Africa’s more recent history.  Despite the formidable challenges we have faced  all of this has begun to change in the last decade. Hopelessness and frustration growing out of a lack of confidence in the future is no longer an image reflecting the reality of Ethiopia. That is perhaps the explanation for the exuberance displayed by all sectors of Ethiopian society in welcoming the new Millennium. A new and strong national consensus is being created in Ethiopia today. It is a consensus around conviction and the resolve to make the opening of our third Millennium a symbol of Ethiopian renaissance.  That overwhelming optimism displayed by all Ethiopians at the opening of the new Millennium rests on a tangible foundation. The political  social and economic realities in Ethiopia have been changing over the past decade. We are making meaningful progress. Indeed  we have no shortage of detractors. These are non-Ethiopians determined to scuttle the progress we are making in all areas. Their attempts include efforts to undermine national unity and to micromanage Ethiopia’s internal affairs. We have seen this  including over the past few days.   Despite all this  however  we continue to make progress. For five consecutive years now  our real gross domestic product growth rate has averaged over 10 per cent. Our per capita income growth has averaged nearly 8 per cent for the last seven years.  More tangible perhaps  in terms of the progress we have been making to change the life situation of our people  is the advance we have registered towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We are set to attain universal primary health care by 2010. We are well on the way to achieving the goals set for reducing child and maternal mortality well prior to 2015. We have made much progress in combating HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases. We have managed to halt and stabilize the spread of HIV/AIDS and reduce the incidence of malaria.  What we have been able to achieve in the area of education has been quite remarkable as well. There is now little doubt that we are on our way to achieving universal primary education by 2015. Primary school enrolment at present is 91.6 per cent. Sixteen years ago  it stood at 19 per cent. We have also begun to ensure that the education available will  in fact  be quality education.  We have also committed ourselves to environmental sustainability in a tangible manner. Our New Ethiopian Millennium celebrations and the preparations leading to them have underlined practical expressions to this commitment. The slogan “Two Trees for 2000” has been enthusiastically taken up throughout the country. Popular enthusiasm has led to the acceleration of the process that began earlier  culminating  after just three or four months  in the opening of the New Millennium and the planting of close to a billion trees. This is a process that will continue throughout the year and beyond.  Nor are we oblivious to the spectre of global warming and the threat of climate change. Africa is exceptionally vulnerable to the effects of climate change: so many of us live on the margins that the smallest difference in climate can mean the difference between sufficient food and famine  survival and death. It is a global challenge that requires a global response.   However  the need for speedy economic development in countries such as Ethiopia  and in Africa as a whole  should not be compromised simply in order to reverse dangerous climatic situations for whose creation we have no responsibility. It should  nonetheless  be possible  through effective international collaboration  to ensure that the developmental process in countries such as Ethiopia is environmentally friendly.   In this regard  we welcome the proposal of Brazil for a new United Nations conference on the environment and development to be held in 2012. We are also appreciative of the European Union's (EU) commitment to further cut its greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce more responsible and sustainable energy policies. We endorse the EU's support for reforming the institutional framework of United Nations environmental activities.  The economic and social progress Ethiopia has made over the past decade has  no doubt  been underpinned by the real and concrete advances we have made in building democratic institutions and fostering the rule of law. In this regard as well  we are entering our New Millennium with even greater and renewed commitment to deepening the democratic process in Ethiopia and strengthening a culture of tolerance and mutual understanding among our people. There is a new spirit of tolerance  dialogue and inclusiveness and of commitment to peace among our people.  The further democratization of the country and the nurturing of the rule of law is a pledge that every Ethiopian is making as we enter our New Millennium. This commitment is rooted in the conviction that durable peace in our country and the successful achievement of our objectives in the economic and social spheres can only be viable if we succeed in advancing towards achieving the democratic aspirations of our people. We urge those who wish to meddle in our affairs to remember that they will be held accountable for their action and that they should desist from seeking to place a trojan horse in our society.  It is that same spirit of the New Ethiopian Millennium that must guide our foreign policy. We have  over the last decade and a half  worked in good faith for peace in our region. We are more prepared now than ever and  in the spirit of the New Millennium  to contribute our share to achieving peace and understanding among peoples and countries  most particularly in our own subregion.  We are indeed fully aware that the basis for the renaissance of Ethiopia  to which we are committed in our New Millennium  cannot be limited to what we do in Ethiopia alone. To be true to the new spirit and to succeed in the rejuvenation of Ethiopia  we feel we have the obligation to stretch a hand of friendship to all of those  near and far  who see wisdom in a positive response to this gesture. We are well aware of the need for a regional atmosphere conducive to the rejuvenation of our region and of ourselves. It is not just the absence of conflict and dispute  but the reality of peace and cooperation  which is  we know  an absolute necessity. Without this we cannot achieve our aims  whether in Ethiopia  our region  or in Africa.  Allow me to express our profound appreciation to all those who have helped us make the progress we have made over the past decade. There are those who have been steadfast in their support for our endeavours and who have stood with us through thick and thin. We are indebted to them. Our obligation is to be true to the principles that underpin those expressions of solidarity.  Ethiopia  a founding Member of the United Nations  will continue to be devoted to multilateralism and the fullest cooperation with the United Nations. Therefore  as I conclude  I wish to reiterate  once again  our readiness to cooperate fully  and without reserve  with our Secretary-General in all areas where our contribution is needed and to seek friendship with all nations in the spirit of our New Millennium. "
"56",2343,"FIN",62,2007,"I would like to congratulate you  Mr. President  and express our support for your leadership of the General Assembly at this session. Finland aligns itself with the statement of the European Union.  The Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals continue to serve as our common pledge to create a better future for everyone. The United Nations is our world organization  and in addressing global challenges  the United Nations is the key forum for our cooperation.  In order to achieve comprehensive security  we must strive not only for security  but also for development and human rights. In the World Summit two years ago  we decided that the United Nations system should be reformed to better ensure the implementation of these three fundamental principles. We should spare no efforts to continue the overall reform of the United Nations.  A more just world is a safer world. Making the Economic and Social Council more effective is an important part of the United Nations reform and of the concept of broad security.  Establishing a new United Nations institution is truly a challenging task. We know that from our own experience. Finland was a member of the Human Rights Council during its first year. But we have to go on. We must sustain our efforts to make the Council a credible institution  capable of defending and promoting globally the human rights of women  men and children. Our good words and intentions must lead to strong action.  The new Peacebuilding Commission must be developed into a platform that can successfully assist countries struggling in post-conflict situations. To support that work  Governments  parliaments   non-governmental organizations and the private sector must also work together. The Peacebuilding Fund must be used as an effective tool to respond to the immediate needs of post-conflict countries.  Achieving the Millennium Development Goals calls for coherent action. Finland strongly supports the recommendations of the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence. The objective of One United Nations at the country level is worth striving for.  We also must reinforce our efforts to address the challenges in the fields of health and education  as so many speakers have mentioned here.  Finland warmly welcomes the Panel’s recommendations concerning gender. We do need to take decisive measures to promote gender awareness across the entire United Nations system. We support the proposal to set up a new  consolidated gender agency with a new Under-Secretary-General position at its head.  In this context  I would like to stress the importance of engaging women in all phases of crisis management: conflict prevention  peacekeeping and peacebuilding  without forgetting peace talks. Let me give one example: the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) Middle East Initiative. I believe that the cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian women under this initiative can help to restart the peace negotiations. I also use this opportunity to state that Finland is preparing its national action plan to advance the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women  peace and security.  A stronger United Nations also needs reform of the Secretariat. In this regard  we welcome the additional emphasis given to the rule of law. Support for the rule of law is a necessity in the consolidation of global security.  Sustainable development requires us to consistently promote fairer globalization and the well-being of nature. Climate change affects the future of the whole of mankind. Finland highlights the necessity to reach  as soon as possible  a globally inclusive agreement on the post-2012 climate regime. The United Nations has a central role to play in this process.  Every nation has the right to develop and to aim for growth and prosperity. Industrialized countries must demonstrate solidarity with developing countries and take all possible steps to promote access to environmentally sound technologies for everyone.  I believe that the tone of the climate change debate is developing in a promising direction. Many Member States and various regions and social actors have become active and have produced initiatives concerning the development of climate policy. We have to take advantage of that as an asset in the run-up to the Bali Climate Change Conference  to be held in December.  The high-level event on climate change held on 24 September was a success. I feel that it gave us the political support that we will need when we are heading towards Bali. Everyone’s input will  of course  be required. Finland appreciates the fact that the President of the General Assembly has made this topic one of his priorities.  We need effective international cooperation in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation. For example  given the number of victims in today’s conflicts  small arms and light weapons are indeed weapons of mass destruction. Finland  together with more than 150 other States  supports the process aimed at the adoption of an international arms trade treaty.  The role of the United Nations is vital in resolving numerous crises around the world. This morning  we heard news from Burma/Myanmar  where the people’s fight for freedom and human rights has been suppressed. We must react. United Nations activities need political support and our resources.  We value the determination of the Secretary-General in searching for a solution to the crisis in the Sudan. The new peacekeeping operation in Darfur will increase the total number of United Nations troops to more than 100 000. That remarkable figure proves that the United Nations enjoys the trust of the international community. We welcome Security Council resolution 1778 (2007)  adopted yesterday  on an international presence in Chad and the Central African Republic.  In order to achieve success in crisis management  we need partnerships and shared responsibilities. For example  the African Union and the European Union have been valuable partners of the United Nations. The support of local and regional actors is critical for successful United Nations peacekeeping.  We Europeans believe that resolving Kosovo’s status is vitally important. In that process  the United Nations Special Envoy has played a pivotal role. We encourage all parties to engage constructively in finding a solution to that problem.  Let me assure the Assembly that Finland supports a stronger United Nations for a better world. It is up to us to deliver on our commitments to achieving better security  sustainable development and respect for the human rights of all people. I wish to express our firmest support to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  in pursuing such efforts. "
"57",2387,"FJI",62,2007,"On behalf of  the people of Fiji  I extend to you  Mr. President  and to the General Assembly  our warm greetings: Ni sa bula and Namaste. We would also like congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.  I would also like to acknowledge the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We wish to extend to him our warmest congratulations  as this is his first full Assembly session as Secretary-General. We note with gratitude the initiatives he has taken in the brief period since he assumed leadership to enhance momentum in the work of the United Nations. Fiji appreciates in particular his policy of inclusiveness and the attention that he is giving to the vulnerable situation and the special needs of small island nations.  At the outset  Fiji wishes to reiterate its unwavering commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  pursuing environmentally friendly and sustainable development activities and addressing the challenges of climate change. As those issues have been widely debated in the Assembly  I would like to take this opportunity to address other issues of particular concern to Fiji.  United Nations-led peacekeeping operations are renowned worldwide and have become the human face  of this multilateral body in war-torn and conflict-prone regions of the world. For its part  Fiji continues to stand ready to shoulder the burden of promoting international peace. In that regard  we have offered our services to the African Union-United Nations hybrid peacekeeping operation in the Sudan. In the same vein  Fiji is committed to our collective resolve to enlarge the presence of the United Nations in Iraq. We are willing to contribute further towards that end  should the need arise.  Today  the demand for peacekeeping continues to grow. With it comes the need for institutional reform to adequately cater for the ever-changing nature of world conflict. I would like to reiterate Fiji’s support for all reform efforts  including the latest initiative of the Secretary-General to reform the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. At the same time  I would urge the Secretariat to continue to resist the politicization of United Nations peacekeeping and to maintain the sanctity of its independence as a forum wherein the willing may volunteer their services freely and without bilateral mangling and interference.  I now seek your indulgence  Mr. President  and that of the Assembly  to speak about the situation  particular circumstances and needs of Fiji at this stage of its nationhood as an independent sovereign nation. Fiji’s overall situation is that it is in a deep rut. It needs the understanding and support of the international community to be able to move forward to regain its dignity and its rightful place as a responsible member of the international family of nations. I am mindful  as I stand here today in the presence of the Assembly  that members may see me as the military leader who removed an elected Government. I cannot begrudge them that  because that indeed is a fact. I submit to the Assembly that  although the Government of the day was removed from power last December  such action was taken with extreme reluctance. I am not a politician; nor do I aspire to be one. I am certainly not much of a diplomat  and I am not used to speaking in forums such as this. Therefore  in what I say and in how I may put it  if in any way I am remiss with regard to the protocols of the Assembly  I seek understanding.  By the time the military intervened last December  Fiji’s overall governance situation had regressed to a catastrophic level. The international community needs to fully understand the special local context of Fiji’s situation. Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970  inheriting an institutional infrastructure that could potentially have evolved further and been strengthened to allow democracy to take root. At that time  almost four decades ago  Fiji’s future appeared to be one of promise and potential. For instance  in terms of per capita income  Fiji was then in the same league as Malaysia and Thailand. We  the people of Fiji  viewed our country with pride and dignity and felt that that was the way the world should be. For more than a decade after achieving independence  Fiji did continue to make steady progress in economic development  education  poverty reduction and generally improving the living conditions of its people.  Yet  in 1970  Fiji started its journey as a young nation on a rather shaky foundation  with a race-based constitution that rigidly compartmentalized our communities. The “democracy” that came to be practiced in Fiji was marked by divisive  adversarial  inward-looking  raced-based politics. The legacy of leadership  at both community and national levels  was a fractured nation. Fiji’s people were not allowed to share a common national identity. Of the two major communities  indigenous Fijians were instilled with fear of dominance and dispossession by Indo-Fijians  and they desired protection of their status as the indigenous people. Indo-Fijians  on the other hand  felt alienated and marginalized as second class citizens in their own country  the country of their birth  Fiji.  The dates 14 May and 25 September 1987 are fateful in Fiji’s history and also for Fiji’s military forces. The military coups of that year were motivated by an ethno-nationalist  racist supremacy agenda. Those political  communal and military leaders who were responsible for the coups and related actions in 1987 carry a very large burden in their collective conscience for the severe ruptures to the very fabric of Fiji society and the dislocations and suffering that they caused in the lives of many of Fiji’s citizens.  In May 2000  Fiji suffered yet another major setback. Again  a group of ethno-nationalist opportunists  backed by a small errant group within the Fiji military  overthrew the Government of the day. As Commander of the Republic of Fiji military forces  I did not support or condone the coup. I drew upon the structural and cultural organization of the military to intervene and to restore order and a state of security.  The stand-off between the coup perpetrators and the military in May 2000 was potentially explosive at the time and  if not resolved  could have resulted in much bloodshed and even greater chaos. As military Commander  I played a key role in the handing executive authority back into civilian hands in the wake of the 2000 coup. This rested on a number of critical preconditions being met in taking Fiji forward.  An Interim Government was appointed by His Excellency the President of Fiji  with Laisenia Qarase as caretaker Prime Minister. The Interim Government was tasked to pave the way to fresh elections to be held in September of 2001. The other fundamental conditions were that all of the perpetrators of the May 2000 coup  including the military rebels  would be prosecuted  and that the 2000 coup would be publicly renounced as racially motivated.  It is tragic that Fiji’s recovery from the brink of chaos in May 2000 did not endure. In the ensuing years  Fiji’s overall governance took a dramatic turn for the worse. In particular  this was characterized by the politicization of the prison services and the criminal justice system. There was also a significant weakening of the key institutions of governance  a pervasive increase in corruption  serious economic decline combined with fiscal mismanagement  a sharp deterioration in the law and order situation and a deepening of the racial divide in the country. The convicted coup perpetrators were prematurely discharged from prison  and certain coup perpetrators and sympathisers were appointed as senior Government ministers and officials. There was also a series of legislative acts that were deeply divisive and overtly racist.  The 2001 and 2006 general elections were not credible. They were characterized by massive rigging of votes  with an incumbent Government using the State’s resources to buy support. By late 2006  Fiji’s overall situation had deteriorated sharply  heightened by massive corruption and lawlessness  a severe erosion of confidence and an economy on the brink of collapse. Also  during the latter part of 2006  Fiji’s military had to pay particular attention to certain external threats to the sovereignty of the nation.  Under our current constitution  Fiji’s military is charged with national security  defence and the well-being of Fiji’s people. Under the circumstances  the military  under my stewardship  could not possibly see such an unacceptable situation unfold without seeking to address it.  History is testament to how I did in fact respond to the situation. For almost four years  I was strenuous in my efforts to constructively engage the elected leadership of the country  seeking to cause it to reverse its course of action  which was taking the country down the path of destruction into an abyss. The protracted efforts that I made to constructively engage with the previous Government came to no avail. On the contrary  a prominent High Chief connected to the ruling Soqosoqo Duavata Lewenivanua (SDL) party incited a mutiny within the military  and attempts were made not only to remove me  but also to eliminate me.  It was with the utmost of reluctance that Fiji’s military  under my leadership  removed the former Government from power in December 2006.  Many have criticized that decision. In response  I say this: Fiji has a coup culture  a history of civilian or military coups executed in the interests of a few and based on nationalism  racism and greed. In order to remove that coup culture and to make a commitment to democracy and the rule of law  policies which promote racial supremacy and further the interests of economic and social elites must be removed once and for all. Racism  elitism and disrespect for the law are undemocratic. They lead to hatred. They lead to violence  poverty and moral bankruptcy. We saw that in the years leading to the Second World War. We saw the genocide  the concentration camps  the rampant imperialism   which resulted  in turn  in the creation of the United Nations.  Within a month of the removal of the previous Government  the President of the Republic of Fiji resumed his constitutional authority. On 5 January 2007  the President appointed an Interim Government which is mandated to govern Fiji until a new Government is duly elected. With the exception of myself  the make-up of the Interim Government is all civilian. The presidential mandate provides the framework within which the Interim Government  in which I serve as Prime Minister  administers the affairs of the State. We are resolved to take the measures necessary to convene free and fair elections as soon as practically possible. On this  the Interim Government is coordinating closely with Fiji’s fellow members of the Pacific Islands Forum and the larger international community  including the European Union.  Steady progress has been made in a number of areas pertaining to upholding the existing constitution  investigation into alleged abuses of human rights  maintaining the independence of the judiciary and preparatory work for the return of Fiji to parliamentary democracy.  Fiji’s situation is not only complex; its problems are also deep-rooted and structural. There are no quick or easy fixes. The country is now at a very critical crossroad; the situation could escalate into more serious deterioration and instability. It is imperative that any such greater disaster or civil strife be averted.  We therefore seek constructive dialogue and engagement with the international community  with all our bilateral and multilateral development partners  whom we urge to work with us  to help support us  in addressing our fundamental problems in moving Fiji forward. Fiji needs the support of the international community to develop a political and governance framework that is truly democratic  accountable  inclusive  equitable and non-racial and that unifies Fiji’s diverse communities as a nation. That is indeed the larger and most critical of challenges that Fiji now faces.  For our part  we firmly resolve to tackle these challenges on at least four levels: first  to restore stability  law and order and confidence; secondly  to strengthen institutions for good governance including transparency  accountability and an independent and effectively functioning judiciary; thirdly  to carry out major reforms in the economy to facilitate sustainable private-sector-led growth; and lastly  to convene free and fair general elections within a constitutional and governance framework that will ensure that parliamentary democracy is not only restored but can be sustained in Fiji.  To achieve all this  the Interim Government is preparing to launch a major national initiative  referred to as the Peoples Charter for Change and Progress   the PCCP. Through the PCCP  the broad cross section of Fiji’s people will be fully engaged and involved  through consultation and participation  in the development of a comprehensive agenda of actions and measures  as Fiji’s own way of addressing its problems.  For the future  Fiji will look at making the necessary legal changes in the area of electoral reform to ensure true equality at the polls. At present  all citizens have the right to vote for two candidates: one for a national seat of any ethnicity  and another from a communal raced-based seat. This in turn has kept our races apart.   Although democracy in the form of electing a Government was introduced in Fiji at the time of independence  researchers and analysts have suggested that Fijians live in a democracy with a mentality that belongs to the chiefly system. In essence this means that at election time  Fijians living in village and rural areas are culturally influenced to vote for the candidate selected for them by their chiefs  their provincial councils and their church ministers. This leads me to ask whether the countries that are demanding that Fiji immediately return to democracy really understand how distorted and unfair our system is  both legally and culturally.   This must change. Every person will be given the right to vote for only one candidate  irrespective of race or religion. This will send a message to our people that Fiji’s leadership no longer tolerates racial divisions and race-based politics. All men and women are equal in dignity and in rights. Electoral reform in this respect will be looked at by a National Council for Building a Better Fiji  which is designed to entrench the very principle on which the United Nations was founded.   The draft Peoples Charter that will emerge from such a national-level undertaking will provide the political and governance framework  with effective supporting and functioning institutions  to make Fiji a truly democratic and progressive nation.   The draft of the PCCP proposal was circulated widely within the country  with comments and suggestions invited. Additionally  I personally wrote to the leaders of Fiji’s bilateral and multilateral development partners  including the United Nations Secretary-General  on the PCCP initiative.   I am pleased to report that in general this initiative has been received with very strong support within Fiji  in particular from highly reputable and respected civil society and community leaders in the country. The Peoples Charter  once formulated and adopted  will provide the strategic framework or fundamental foundation within which the Interim Government  and successive elected Governments  will be expected to operate.   In the current absence of an elected Government  there is the issue of legitimacy and mandates. To deal with this  the Interim Government is willing to consider putting the draft Peoples Charter to a referendum to get the mandate of the people for the fundamental changes  including changes to the Constitution of Fiji  as may be considered necessary and appropriate.   Fiji needs both financial and technical support from its bilateral and multilateral development partners to be able to effectively realize the vision that underpins the PCCP initiative. Above all  we seek the understanding of the international community to help us rebuild our nation in the true spirit of internationally acceptable precepts of good governance and a democracy that can be made to work and that can be sustained in Fiji.  We must thank those Governments that have stood by and supported Fiji in our hour of need. Fiji is indeed very grateful and is deeply touched by their understanding and goodwill.  Some in the international community  including the closest of our neighbours in the Pacific  have seen fit to impose punitive measures upon Fiji. Of course we know that those powerful States are protecting their own economic and political interests in the region. However  we in Fiji are protecting our democracy and strengthening our democratic institutions. Those powerful States are undermining our attempts to rebuild our nation on strong foundations and are undermining our attempts to appoint people of merit and honesty to our State institutions  regardless of race and religion. Current sanctions target any person appointed by the Interim Government.   This is hypocrisy at its worst on part of those States as they are clearly undermining our efforts to promote and practice good governance. These actions   such as the travel bans  described as smart sanctions   have had a debilitating impact on our struggles to revive  to recover and to reform.  Good governance requires effective  functioning institutions. Since the coups of 1987  Fiji has suffered a massive exodus of the country’s skilled and educated people. The major beneficiaries of the transfer of those quality human assets have been Australia and New Zealand  and from those neighbours in particular we seek understanding and support. Our capacities and institutions have been severely eroded over the years. In all of this  we desperately need help  not a closing of doors.   I shall conclude my statement by reaffirming Fiji’s commitment to the United Nations and to the various United Nations conventions on human rights  the rule of law and democratic governance. Fiji does not seek any unwarranted exemptions from any of those obligations. All we seek is your deeper understanding of our particular circumstances and the complex situation of Fiji. We hope that you will work with us  assist us to rebuild and move Fiji forward.   In closing  I take this opportunity to extend to the Secretary-General an invitation to Fiji and indeed to our Pacific region during his tenure.  "
"58",2434,"FRA",62,2007," To all the  peoples represented here  I convey the brotherly greetings of France. Mr. Secretary-General  you have an enormous responsibility  and you have the trust of France.  This is the first time that I address this Assembly on behalf of France. It is a solemn and moving moment for me. I cannot help thinking of all of those men and women who  at one of the most tragic moments in the history of humanity  as the world stood on the brink of barbarity  finding that prospect intolerable  succeeded in countering force and violence and barbarity with justice and peace. Thus was the United Nations born.  The United Nations is not a mere political construct. It is not a mere legal construct. It is an awakening of the human conscience against everything that threatens to destroy humanity.  I have never believed that the United Nations could one day root out the violence that lies within human beings. But what I do know deep down inside me  what we all know deep down  is that in spite of all its failures  without the United Nations it would have been impossible to put an end to conflicts that seemed to be insoluble. Remember the genocide of the Cambodian people  remember the suffering inflicted upon them; remember the independence of Namibia; remember the independence of Timor. Look at the Great Lakes region  or West Africa. Without the United Nations  the world might have experienced a third world war  doubtless even more terrible than the two previous ones.  France is convinced that the United Nations is the only remedy we have for the blindness and folly that sometimes take hold of human beings.  The message I wish to bring to you in the name of France is a simple one: in this world where the fate of each of us depends on the fate of others  the United Nations should not be weakened; the United Nations must be strengthened. Reforming the United Nations so as to adapt it to the realities of our world is an absolute priority for France. We cannot afford to wait any longer. The world’s problems must be addressed and resolved globally. No one on this Earth can alone protect themselves from the consequences of climate warming  the clash of civilizations  major epidemics. Against selfishness  against fanaticism  against hatred  it is our duty to renew that appeal to the universal conscience by virtue of which  for the first time in the history of all the peoples of the world  all nations agreed to meet within a common forum in order to set aside what divides us and talk to one another. This appeal to the universal conscience is an appeal for peace. It is an appeal for open-mindedness. It is an appeal for diversity. And it is an appeal for justice. France has always sought greatness for the sake of men and women  not for its own sake. Like all nations  France  in the course of its long history  has made mistakes  and has sometimes been at fault. But its people  the people of France  have always chosen to be on the side of freedom and democracy. France is loyal to its friends and to the values it shares with them. But this loyalty is not submission. This loyalty is not a shackle. And France intends to draw on that loyalty in the cause of openness to others  of openness to the world. I want the world to know that France is willing to talk to everybody in the world  in every continent.  But I would also like to say that openness is not renunciation. Understanding is not weakness. Weakness and renunciation are not factors of peace; they are factors of war. France and Europe in the past experienced the tragic consequences of such an attitude for themselves and for the whole world. When you are weak and submissive  you get ready to accept war. We all have a duty to ensure that that never happens again. There will be no peace in the world if the international community compromises with the right of peoples to self-determination and if it compromises with human rights.  There will be no peace in the world unless the international community is unshakeable in its determination to fight terrorism. There will be no peace in the world unless the international community stands united in its resolve to put an end to the wars in the Middle East  to put an end to the horror in Darfur  to the tragedy of Lebanon or to the humanitarian disaster in Somalia. And I weigh my words carefully. There will be no peace in the world if the international community falters in the face of the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Iran is entitled to nuclear power for civilian purposes. But if we allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons  there would be an unacceptable risk to stability in the region and in the world. I want to say here  in the name of France  that we can only resolve this crisis by combining firmness with dialogue. It is in that spirit that France will act.  I want to say here  in the name of France  that it is the duty of the international community to confront those who seek power and constantly threaten the fragile balance of peace and to do so by bringing to bear its unwavering unity and its determination to uphold the law. I want to say  in the name of France  that there will be no peace in the world without respect for diversity  without respect for national identities  without respect  I venture to say  for religions and beliefs  or without respect for cultures. Attachment to one’s faith  to one’s identity  to one’s language and culture  and to one’s way of life  thought and belief   all that is legitimate  and profoundly human. To deny that is to sow the seeds of humiliation. It would stoke the fires of nationalism  fanaticism and terrorism. We will not avert the clash of civilizations by forcing everyone to think and to believe the same things. France intends to pursue  together with all people of goodwill  this battle to build a new world order of the twenty-first century.  We want a Lebanon living independently  and we say that France will always stand shoulder to shoulder with Lebanon in its desire for independence. Tomorrow we hope that Israelis and Palestinians will find within themselves the strength to live in peace. Peace is possible. It is possible now. And we will devote all of our energies to that.  We want to see the peaceful coexistence of the main religions to vanquish fundamentalism and fanaticism. But I want to say  with all due gravity  that there is too much injustice in the world for the world to hope to live in peace.  The founding fathers of the United Nations knew that the world’s future could be read in the eyes of a tortured child; a hungry child; children who watch their parents being humiliated; children who since birth have known nothing but war; children torn from their homes  their lands  their families. Because in those children’s desperate eyes there is not only suffering  but also all the wars and revolts that will drench the world in blood tomorrow.  Let us look at the world as it is. Let us look at what we have made of it. Have we wanted enough to make it more just? The answer is no. Have we done enough to achieve that end? The answer is no.   When the Berlin wall fell  we all dreamed that history would cease to be tragic. Let us look at our world as it is so that we can make it better. Let us judge our world by the yardstick of justice. Justice means that the Palestinian people can regain a country and build a State. Justice means that the Israeli people can enjoy the right to live in security. Justice means that the Lebanese people can regain their freedom. Justice means that the Iraqi people  in all their diversity  can find within themselves the path to reconciliation and democracy. Justice means that a developing country on which we wish to impose environmental rules  even though its inhabitants have barely enough to eat  can be helped to put such rules in place. Justice means that we cannot tap a country’s resources without paying a fair price for them.  Let us look squarely at our world. Never before has there been so much easy money  with so much wealth concentrated in the hands of a few large groups. Throughout the world  even in the richest countries  there are many men and women who no longer have even a hope of emerging some day from their material and moral distress.   In conclusion  I appeal to the conscience of all those who have a responsibility for the conduct of world affairs. Because if we do nothing  the poor and the exploited will one day rise up against the injustice done to them.  What the world needs is a new mindset: a genuine New Deal on a global scale  an ecological and economic New Deal. On behalf of France  I call on all States to join together to found the new world order of the twenty-first century  predicated on the key idea that the common goods of humanity must be the responsibility of all of humanity.   On behalf of France  I solemnly appeal to the United Nations to provide itself  in this era marked by the return of scarcity  with the means to guarantee that all people throughout the world have access to vital resources: water  energy  food  medicine and knowledge. I solemnly appeal to the United Nations to concern itself with the issue of fairer distribution of wealth and of the income derived from commodities and technology. I solemnly appeal to the United Nations to concern itself with the moralization of financial capitalism. I solemnly appeal to the United Nations to go further in combating corruption  which saps countries that are suffering and all too poor.  Things must change. Mindsets must change. Behaviour must change. This is our responsibility now  because tomorrow it will be too late. If we fail to act  we will see a resurgence of all the threats that the people of the post-war world believed they had overcome. Let us not take this risk lightly.   Peoples of the world  we can  together  build a better future for all people. It is up to us alone; it is up to our capacity to remain faithful to the values that have brought us together here today. You have understood. France believes that we have no more time to wait. France calls for action. France urges action. France is committed to action in the service of world peace. "
"59",2459,"FSM",62,2007,"I am honoured to take part in the general debate of the General Assembly for the first time since taking office as President of the Federated States of Micronesia in May this year. On this occasion  I am honoured to express to Mr. Srgjan Kerim my respect and congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I have every confidence that he will live up to the high standards of his esteemed predecessors. I wish to also convey my congratulations to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  as he takes the helm of the Organization. I pledge to the Secretary-General my Government’s strong support. I wish to reaffirm our commitments and the importance that my country attaches to multilateralism and the purposes and principles of the United Nations.  A few days ago  on 24 September  we met in this very Hall to take stock of a global threat which probably is the single most important challenge facing our planet today: climate change. Long before it became fashionable for climate change to be mainstreamed into the global agenda  Micronesia was in the forefront of those speaking out for action against what is now recognized as a global emergency. For years  we have argued that  as a small island developing State  we are among the most vulnerable  and that climate change threatens our very existence.  We have come a long way in a short time. Consider where we were just 15 years ago when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was signed: climate change was then considered by most as hypothetical and as a threat that was more imagined than real. Now  climate change is accepted as a reality and its adverse impact seen as inevitable and life-threatening  most especially to small island developing States like Micronesia. The current sense of urgency paid to climate change by the world community  as evidenced by high-level meetings around the world  is truly encouraging  but we are still far from reaching the objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol.  We need to take collective action now and act responsibly to save our planet  while taking into consideration the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. If our actions are to be effective  it is imperative that we pursue the climate change agenda both with a sense of urgency and within the framework of the United Nations. It is important that acknowledgment of the threats of climate change be accompanied by provision of adequate and additional financing by the developed countries to the most vulnerable to assist us in coping with our adaptation and mitigation requirements. We therefore support an appropriate institutional arrangement for the Adaptation Fund that is responsive to the needs of small island developing States.  Adaptation and mitigation have many faces  one of which is the pressing need for small island developing States to have increased access to renewable sources of energy  so that we can move away from our long dependence on fossil fuels. In that regard  I must acknowledge with gratitude the kind assistance extended by the Governments of Italy  India and others to small island developing States of the Pacific.  In March  Micronesia presented its proposal for adjusting the Montreal Protocol in order to enhance its effectiveness. Although our proposed adjustment was aimed at improving the effectiveness of the Protocol’s ozone mandate  Micronesia has a special interest in the significant climate benefits associated with the Montreal Protocol. We welcome the positive outcome of the historic nineteenth Meeting of the Parties. We hope that other relevant multilateral environmental agreements will also make similar efforts to produce climate benefits.  Two years ago  at the eighth Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity  which was held in Curitiba  Brazil  the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau showcased the Micronesia Challenge. A collaborative effort among the island States and territories of the North Pacific  the Micronesia Challenge exemplifies the best of the Micronesian spirit of working together towards a common objective and with shared concerns. In effect  the Micronesia Challenge sets aside for conservation at least 30 per cent of our marine and 20 per cent of terrestrial biodiversity across the Micronesian region by 2020.  We are grateful to the regional and international organizations and non-governmental organizations that have provided support to realize the objectives of our initiative. We are seeking international partnership and assistance to overcome the many obstacles that inhibit the implementation of the Micronesia Challenge. My Government urges the Global Environment Facility to join with others   such as the Government of Turkey   in providing assistance to that end.  I cannot overemphasize the critical role that information and communication technologies play in the socio-economic development of developing countries  particularly that of small island developing States. Given that the islands of the Federated States of Micronesia are widely dispersed in the north-west Pacific Ocean  and owing to our limited resources and high transportation costs  we face many monumental challenges. To confront those challenges  Micronesia believes that access to affordable and reliable information and communication technologies offers us a solution that not only addresses our infrastructure deficiencies but also enables us to meet the aims of the Millennium Declaration  the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the objectives relating to information and communication technologies emanating from the World Summit on the Information Society.   It is a high priority of my country to bring broadband connectivity to the islands. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States are collaborating on the development of a Pacific Ocean connectivity project that will address the need for developing information and communication technologies infrastructure in the Pacific. We hope that the project will allow our region to establish an effective partnership with the international community and help produce the kind of benefits that will help support our sustainable development goals. We will not  however  be able to implement the project without the financial support of the international community.  I commend the progress on the United Nations Pacific Presence Initiative  which in the case of my country is being represented by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). For the past several years  we have voiced our concern over the lack of an adequate United Nations presence in Micronesia to assist us in addressing our development challenges. This much-anticipated initiative will be translated into reality for Micronesia later this year. It is an initiative that we will not fail to utilize to the fullest. It is therefore essential that  in keeping with the objective of the joint office to be situated in my country  the original intent with regard to staffing must be adhered to if the Initiative is going to make a difference  both in terms of the effective implementation of United Nations programmes on the ground and in enhancing my country’s capacity to access its fair share of other sources of assistance and services provided by the United Nations system.   As one of the countries identified by UNDP as being among those more challenged in meeting the Millennium Development Goals  my country places high value on an appropriate level of United Nations presence in the joint office located in my country to assist us in implementation and effectively utilizing external assistance towards achieving the MDGs. My Government commends UNDP and UNFPA for developing a plan for the next five-year programme cycle that will provide financial assistance to help my country address issues of poverty and institutional capacity. The joint United Nations office will be an important vehicle and will certainly play a pivotal role in the implementation and achievement of the specific objectives of the programme. We look forward to the implementation of the programme.  As custodian of a vast ocean area whose bounty we share with the international community  I would be remiss if I did not make a few comments on the issue of oceans and seas. First  I would like to express our gratitude to the Government of Norway and others that have contributed to the trust fund created to assist small island developing States in claiming their extended continental shelves in compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are  however  concerned about the obstacles that continue to inhibit access to the fund. There are far too many institutional barriers that need to be immediately rectified to enable use of the fund to allow island developing States to fulfil their obligations under the Convention on the Law of the Sea.  As a people  Micronesians are highly dependent on their marine resources for their livelihood. We take great interest in the conservation and sustainable use of our marine and fisheries resources. We cannot help but raise concerns with regard to the issue of collateral catches or discards in commercial fisheries. While they may be considered discards to others  they are a critical resource that our people depend upon for their subsistence living. The international community should vigorously seek ways to address this issue to minimize and eliminate the incidence of catching untargeted fish. Another significant and troubling issue continues to be that of bottom-trawl fishing. It would be tragic to our marine ecosystem and biodiversity if that destructive fishing practice were to continue unabated. We renew our call  made from this rostrum years ago  for a moratorium on bottom trawling.  I wish to refer favourably to the long-standing effort by Italy and many others to encourage this body to take a consensus position against the imposition of the death penalty. Last year  my country signed the statement delivered by Finland on this important subject (see A/61/PV.81). We steadfastly maintain our support for this cause.  Turning to the drawn-out discussion over United Nations reform  I should like to reiterate our concern that the reform of the United Nations will not be complete without the reform of the Security Council. We also reaffirm our support for Japan and India  from the Asia-Pacific region  as permanent members of the Council. At the same time  greater representation needs to be given to developing countries  including island States and small States.  While we continue to stand by our position on Security Council reform  we will support any innovative ideas that can lead to further progress on the issue  such as the proposal for an intergovernmental negotiation process. At the sixty-second session of the General Assembly  we must continue the process already begun and make every effort to achieve results.  I should like to close by expressing a sense of optimism about what the nations gathered here can achieve in advancing the admittedly ambitious agenda of the United Nations. Given the challenges that we face  it is only through optimism and determination over time that we can overcome them. We in the Federated States of Micronesia will be here to do our part. "
"60",2502,"GAB",62,2007,"At the  beginning of my statement  I would like to convey my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. Your election  Mr. President  constitutes undoubtedly significant recognition of your country for its prioritized and resolute actions with respect to implementation of the goals of the United Nations. But it is also  in personal terms  the successful outcome of a long and fruitful career as a diplomat and  professor of international relations. In addition  in warmly congratulating you  I would like to assure you of the support my country  and of my own support  as you carry out your challenging and noble mission.  Allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for the dedication  wisdom and skill with which she steered our deliberations  and particularly for her having led the necessary negotiations with respect to consideration and implementation of the important recommendations of the 2005 World Summit  which included reform of the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council.  To the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  I would like to express my full encouragement as he carries out his functions at the head of the United Nations. The major reform that he has initiated in order to adapt the Organization to the needs of a world in constant change deserves everyone’s support.  The theme for the general debate  climate change  which you have proposed for this year  is one of the primary concerns of the international community. The selection of this very theme by the Secretary-General as the framework for the discussion during the high-level debate that was just held is additional evidence of this. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force in 2005 and was a major historical milestone in the process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  With respect to trends in this phenomenon  every one can note that the goals set forth in the Protocol have yet to be fully achieved. We  therefore  need to do our utmost so that the Bali meeting in Indonesia  slated for December 2007  will be an opportunity to reach agreement on a common  global strategy in order to carry out more robust  collective action to mitigate significantly the negative effects of global warming.  Africa  which contributes least of all to the worsening of this phenomenon  is unfairly undergoing the serious consequences of it. Therefore  the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities needs to be applied. For its part  Gabon  whose forest is one of the essential components of the major Congo Basin  the second ecological lung of the planet after the Amazon  has unreservedly acceded to the Convention on Biological Diversity and has joined up in the fight against climate change. Moreover  it has decided to devote 11 per cent of its territory to humankind  particularly by establishing 13 national parks. Recently  Lopé park was named as a new UNESCO world heritage site  and Gabon is prepared to go much further  because protection of the environment is an important pillar in the fight against poverty and an essential condition to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  As is evident  then  Gabon has undertaken considerable efforts in order to bring about greater protection of nature and of ecosystems. As a result  Gabon  together with other African countries  deserves to benefit from compensatory measures from industrialized countries  the main emitters of carbon dioxide.   From this standpoint  we urge the establishment of a stabilization fund to compensate for existing forest carbon stocks. We also would like to ensure that our forests are included in the carbon market mechanisms.   The General Assembly is the appropriate forum to discuss the major challenges that our world is facing. That was the strong message reaffirmed by the world’s leaders when they assembled here for the September 2005 world summit. I welcome the fact that the major decisions taken at that time continue to drive the reform of our Organization.   The report of the High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence indicates the scope of the changes to be made to ensure greater effectiveness in implementation of the Organization’s programmes. Here  I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the President of the Assembly at its sixty-first session for having launched intergovernmental consultations on this important issue.  The intensive activities of the General Assembly in recent years clearly attests to its central role as the principal representative organ and deliberative body responsible for setting the policies of the Organization. I have no doubt that you  Sir  will continue your efforts to strengthen the authority and primary role of the General Assembly. Similarly  one of the key measures that our Organization needs to bring about to improve the implementation and ensure the legitimacy of its decisions is reform of the Security Council. We will need to reach agreement in order to carry out this reform that is so important for the future of the United Nations.   This session is beginning in a complex and unstable international context that is marked by deep crises and many kinds of threats. The geography of the conflicts puts the spotlight on Africa and the Middle East.   In Africa  the situation in Darfur continues to be of concern. However  I would like to praise the efforts of the Sudanese Government  which has undertaken to participate in comprehensive peace talks on 27 October 2007 in Tripoli and to accept the principle of a ceasefire. Gabon  for its part  will continue to firmly support the national peace and reconciliation process in the Sudan. To this end  it welcomes the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 1769 (2007)  authorizing the deployment of an Africa Union-United Nations hybrid force in the Sudan.   Furthermore  Gabon  which has for many years played a major role in the many negotiations on national reconciliation in Africa  supports the efforts undertaken by the European Union  particularly in protecting civilians and providing humanitarian assistance in Chad and the Central African Republic.   Specifically with regard to Chad  Gabon is currently facilitating peace and reconciliation talks among factions in that country.   The instability in Somalia for the past 15 years has negated any possibility of development. However  we need to mention the praiseworthy decision of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union in authorizing the deployment of a peacekeeping mission in that country.   With respect to the situation in the Middle East  more specifically  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  only concerted and sustained efforts based on the principle of two States  Israel and Palestine  coexisting in peace and security within secure and internationally recognized borders  can bring about a lasting and just settlement of this conflict.   My country endorses the idea of holding an international conference under the auspices of the Quartet  in order to relaunch the process of direct and constructive negotiations.   With respect to Lebanon  Gabon reaffirms its support for implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). With respect to the issue of international terrorism  I would like to commend the General Assembly’s adoption on 8 September 2006 of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. While politically that is praiseworthy progress  nevertheless in legal terms we need to accelerate current negotiations in order to adopt a general counter-terrorism convention.   In the twenty-first century  threats to international peace and security are not limited solely to terrorism  war and international conflicts. Organized crime  civil violence  poverty  infectious diseases  natural disasters and weapons of mass destruction are also phenomena that can undermine the survival and foundations of the State as the basic element of the international system.  With respect to weapons of mass destruction  we need urgently to end the stalemate in the multilateral talks and to again place disarmament and non-proliferation issues at the forefront of the concerns of the international community. Our collective security depends on it.   On the HIV/AIDS pandemic  which severely affects many African countries  we need to act proportionately to the seriousness of this scourge. Furthermore  as was underscored in the political declaration on HIV/AIDS adopted in New York on 2 June 2006 as the outcome of the high-level meeting on that pandemic  the African countries are already allocating considerable financial resources to counter this scourge. Despite these efforts  our countries continue to face a shortfall of the resources necessary to achieving universal access to prevention  care and treatment by 2010. From this standpoint  Gabon welcomes the commitment taken by Group of Eight (G-8) in Germany  granting to Africa under development assistance the amount of $60 billion to fight malaria  HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.   More than a year ago  our Organization gave itself a peacebuilding mechanism. Here  I would like to reiterate my appreciation of the work already done by the Peacebuilding Commission under the presidency of Angola  as well as by all of the members of the Commission for their efforts to devise an effective strategy bringing together all the national and international players involved in the processes of reconstruction in Burundi and Sierra Leone.  These countries  like all developing countries  need ongoing support from the international community  in accordance with the decisions taken under the Monterrey Consensus and reaffirmed at the 2005 World Summit. From this standpoint  the donor countries need to meet their pledges for assistance to developing countries  particularly in the areas of debt relief and opening their markets. To that end  the implementation of the Doha programme is an imperative for developing countries and will particularly enable countries in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.   Similarly  we need to continue our brainstorming in order to identify and launch innovative sources for development financing. That is a priority objective for our countries  particularly since our resources are limited because of debt reimbursement  and this prevents us from responding effectively to development needs.  Here  I would like to pay tribute to the Paris Club  which has agreed to the principle of Gabon’s buying back its debt. This agreement is key for Gabon in its legitimate quest for economic prosperity and social well-being.  It is in this spirit of renewed international solidarity and in effective partnership that we will be able to build a better world that respects the rights and dignity of the individual. This vision of the founding fathers of our Organization is also shared by my country and its President  El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba  who has always been able to work for the protection and promote human rights.  In keeping with these values  the Government of Gabon recently decided to abolish the death penalty and was a sponsor of the draft resolution on establishing a moratorium on the death penalty.  The United Nations has existed now for sixty-two years. From the cold war to the collapse of the Berlin Wall  it has been able to stand  together with the society of nations  the test of time. Unfortunately  however  and despite its long history  it has not been able to fully bring about the profound aspirations of liberty  equality and peace and justice  as expressed by the peoples of the world. The ongoing reforms need to be continued in order to enable the United Nations to be the mirror of diversity and human values. "
"61",2549,"GBR",62,2007,"It is a great  honour to make my first speech to the General Assembly.  The United Nations has a duty to lead the world in addressing the shared threats and opportunities that dominate our age  and it must do so in deed as well as in word. That is why I want to use this platform to express my admiration and support for United Nations missions around the world  from Lebanon to Liberia  from Congo and Haiti to East Timor  which  even as we meet in New York this week  are saving lives and spreading hope.  Since 1946  when the first meeting of the General Assembly took place in London  the United Kingdom has been determined to fulfil its international responsibilities through the United Nations. The new Government in the United Kingdom  under the leadership of Gordon Brown  is proud to continue that tradition  and I reaffirm our commitment today.  The focus at this session has been on immediate and pressing issues. In the Middle East  we need urgent action towards a two-State solution that addresses the security of Israelis and the rights of Palestinians at the same time.   In Iraq  recent security gains can only be sustained through continued support for the development of the Iraqi security forces  through national reconciliation and through political support from the whole region.  Our international community depends on responsibilities as well as rights. If Iran wants to be a leading and respected country  it must cease its support for terrorist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan and end its defiance of three Security Council resolutions in respect of its nuclear programme.  In Zimbabwe  we need United Nations action to support African leadership to reverse the vicious cycle of economic and social devastation that now afflicts the country.  We have all seen the extraordinary scenes in Burma. I call on the regime to allow peaceful protest  encourage national dialogue and promote genuine reconciliation. Let us today send a message to the monks on the streets of Burma: we support your demand for a democratic Burma. And let us take a message from the monks on the streets of Burma: the human desire for freedom knows no bounds of race or religion or region. It is good that the Burmese Government has allowed Ambassador Gambari into the country  but it is now vital that they use his presence there to start the process of reconciliation.  But as well as addressing the traumas of our fellow citizens around the world  the United Nations must be the place where we address the longer-term threats. Today  I devote my speech to one of the great threats to stability and prosperity in the world: the threat of global inequality. I do so because inequalities are not just morally offensive; they are also dangerous. Inequality fuels extremism. It undermines support for an open  global economy. It corrodes trust and respect and reciprocity between nations.  The United Nations Charter talks of the “sovereign equality of States”  and it also talks of the “equal rights and dignity of men and women and of nations large and small”. The principle of equality is nowhere more evident than in the General Assembly where all States have an equal voice. But in the world outside this Hall  economic  social and political inequalities within and between States persist and worsen. We cannot stand united against the shared threats and opportunities in our world when we are so divided by economic and political disparities. So the need for Governments and international institutions to reduce inequalities and promote our common humanity is stark.  Traditionally  we have focused on the divide between developed and developing nations. However  the growth rates in many developing countries are faster than in developed economies. That is the good news. But there remain around a billion people in the world   one sixth of its population   living in 58 countries  who have been left out of the story of human progress. This “bottom billion” have an average life expectancy of 50 years. Fourteen per cent of the children in the bottom billion die before their fifth birthday  and more than a third suffer malnutrition. The countries that are home to the bottom billion saw their national incomes fall each year during the 1980s and 1990s.  Even where inequalities are narrowing between nations  they are widening within them. According to the United Nations Development Programme  in 73 countries   containing 80 per cent of the world’s population   economic inequality has risen in recent years.  Every nation represented here has responsibilities to its own people. The drive to tackle poverty needs open markets. It needs the empowerment of citizens through democratic and transparent institutions  free from corruption. It needs strong and effective education and health services open to all.  But national action is not enough. Because the causes of inequality cross national boundaries  we need cooperation between nations  bilateral and multilateral  led by the United Nations.  First  three quarters of the countries where the bottom billion citizens reside have recent or current experience of civil war. Conflict is the trapdoor to extreme poverty. Look at Darfur: more than 200 000 people are dead  2 million are displaced and 4 million are on food aid. As the international community  we decided on a course of action in Security Council resolution 1769 (2007). Now we need to get on with it: an agreement on force composition  swift deployment  effective protection of civilians on the ground and a political process in which the legitimate grievance of the Darfur people is addressed through negotiation. In Afghanistan  one of the five poorest countries in the world  we need to back up military efforts to secure safe space with economic  social and political reconstruction.  Beyond those crises  we also need to improve our capacity to prevent the emergence of conflict. That is our vision of the responsibility to protect. A critical dimension is controlling the spread of weapons whose easy availability makes it so simple to set up militias and provoke violence and mayhem. Last year  the Assembly voted overwhelmingly to take forward United Nations work towards an arms trade treaty (see resolution 61/89). The Government of the United Kingdom will continue to press for the achievement of that goal.  Secondly  freedom from conflict is the platform for progress  but the battle against disease and illiteracy is the second stage. Despite progress in some countries  the world is off track to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). That is why  in July here at the United Nations  the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom launched a call for action: to honour our own commitments and go further  to build a truly global partnership   with the private sector  trade unions  faith groups  civil society and cities   that can meet the 2015 MDG targets. That requires the developed world to meets its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of its national incomes on development. The United Kingdom will meet that commitment by 2013. But that requires shared responsibility. Poor governance and corruption are the enemies of development.  Thirdly  progress on aid needs to be combined with a new global trade deal that opens up economies on a fair basis. Western producers continue to benefit from subsidies and tariffs  particularly for agriculture. Higher tariffs for processed goods prevent poor countries from diversifying their economies. That is a bad deal for Western consumers  and it squeezes out the livelihoods of producers in poor countries. Neither is it in rich countries’ financial self-interest  nor is it fair. The Government of the United Kingdom believes that concluding the Doha trade round this year is not just necessary  but also possible  and we will work to achieve that goal.  Finally  we must address the greatest long-term threat to our aspirations to tackle inequality: climate change. Climate change affects all countries  but the poorest countries   and the poorest people within those countries   will suffer the most disruption and devastation. I congratulate the President of the General Assembly on choosing climate change as a central theme of this general debate. And I congratulate the Secretary-General on his leadership on this issue. But we need more than debate.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the only body that can conclude a global agreement on climate change. Therefore  in the next two months we need an urgent agreement on the steps towards progress to be taken at the December meeting in Bali. Beyond that  we need a road map to the 15th conference of parties to the Convention  to be held at Copenhagen in two years’ time  and agreement on a global deal that succeeds the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.  At the heart of such an agreement must be the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: all countries taking on responsibilities  but making sure that they are equitably distributed  with the greatest action taken by the richest countries. The United Kingdom stands ready to play its part. This year  our climate change bill will be enacted into law in the next session of Parliament to place on a statutory footing our commitment to cut carbon emissions by at least 60 per cent from 1990 levels by the year 2050. But we need similar binding commitments from all rich countries.  The challenges are therefore immense. Crisis resolution and conflict prevention  the Millennium Development Goals  a new trade deal  climate change   they call for all our resources. Military intervention is never the whole solution  but sometimes a solution cannot be found without armed force. Development budgets are necessary  but the developing world needs a growth plan  not just an aid plan. Diplomacy needs to bridge differences between nations  but also to reach out to civil society and business.  The United Kingdom is proud not just of its bilateral relations with the countries represented in the Assembly  but also of its commitment to multilateral institutions  which can be a force for good in the world. But international institutions need to reflect the world as it is  not the world as it was. The United Kingdom therefore welcomes the prospect of intergovernmental negotiations at this session to achieve agreement on reform of the Security Council. We support permanent membership for Germany  Japan  India and Brazil and permanent representation for Africa. We are not wedded to a single model of reform. Achieving effective change is what matters.  In a world where more than a billion people are online  where companies have bigger turnovers than countries and where global non-governmental organizations have memberships that are bigger than national populations  our international institutions must look inwards to internal reform  but also outwards to broader popular movements for change.  In the last phase of globalization  in the nineteenth century  the emergence of new Powers and the breakdown of the international order resulted in conflict that scarred the whole of the twentieth century. Unless we can build trust and reciprocity between nations and embody them in durable and robust international institutions that reconcile differences and nurture common values  the latest phase of globalization could be another false dawn.  Globalization is not just something to which we must adapt; it is something that we can and must shape for the achievement of our own goals. It must be put to use spreading power  wealth and opportunity. For my Government  this mission is driven by both moral purpose and national interest. We must address the insecurity and inequality that exist beyond our borders if we are to enhance security and prosperity within our borders.  We live in a more prosperous  more peaceful and more democratic world than ever before. Let us commit ourselves to living in a more equal world. "
"62",2573,"GEO",62,2007,"I am grateful for the opportunity today to address this sixty-second annual gathering of the General Assembly.  On behalf of my nation  I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General on his innovative leadership and on the exceptional progress he has made in his first nine months. His steadfast vision for peace in Darfur  his commitment to rallying the world to combat climate change and his determination to eradicate global poverty stand true to the founding principles of this institution.  Let me also extend my congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly and express our appreciation to his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her very effective leadership.  Today  in this great Hall  we have an opportunity to reaffirm one of the core principles of the United Nations ""the right of every individual to pursue a life of liberty in dignity” by voicing our support for hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters  monks and ordinary citizens  daring to seek freedom for the people of Myanmar. We must stand fast with them. It is my deepest hope that we will look back and remember this saffron revolution of the Burmese monks as another step in the inevitable march of liberty across the planet. It echoes the rose and orange revolutions that freed the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine from hopelessness and stagnation just a few years ago.  When we returned Georgia to its rightful path of peace  democracy and transparency  we did so in the knowledge that our country was not an island. We knew that  in order for our freedom to endure  we would have to help advance the peaceful aspirations of others around the world  as a responsible member of the international community of democratic nations. That is why Georgia has lent its sons and daughters to peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo  Afghanistan and Iraq. And just this month  we committed a new battalion to serve under French command in Kabul.  This is why we have reached out to our neighbours in Europe  Central Asia and beyond to promote peace through cooperation  trade and deeper engagement. Together  we are working to help ensure new and diverse supplies of energy for European and global markets. We contribute to the integrated effort by building new roads  railways and pipelines that weave together the countries of our region  ensuring that people and goods flow across our borders in a manner that is safe  legal  predictable and fair. In short  our vision for the region is guided by the belief that mutual interdependence brings mutual benefit.  I believe that the people of Georgia have served as a catalyst and a living example of how governing transparently  through democratic principles  breeds lasting stability and shared prosperity. This is not  of course  a new path for Georgia  but rather a return to our European home and our European vocation  so deeply enshrined in our national identity and history.  And  while our most challenging relationship today remains with our neighbours in the Russian Federation  my Government is committed to addressing this subject through diplomatic means  in partnership with the international community. I can say this with confidence  because Georgia is a nation that is rooted in justice  the rule of law and democracy. This is an irreversible choice made by the people of my country. For evidence of that  one merely has to look at how Georgia has responded to the many provocations it has faced in the past year  which range from missile attacks to full-scale embargoes and even destructive pogroms. Rather than lash out angrily  we have redoubled our commitment to democratic development and comprehensive reform. My Government and I have done everything we can to show how much can be achieved when good governance opens the door to the development of human potential.  Today Georgia's economy is growing at over 14 per cent. Our gross domestic product per capita has more than doubled in four years.  Corruption is the lowest among transition economies around the world and one of the lowest in Europe  according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. And as of today  our country has taken its place alongside some of the most developed economies in the world like Australia  New Zealand  the United Kingdom  Singapore and Hong Kong  Iceland  when the World Bank and the International Financial Corporation ranked Georgia as the 18th easiest and best place to do business because of institutionalized transparency and a lack of corruption.  We were 140th in world  one of the worst rankings  and now we have one of the best rankings for business and in terms of economic development and economic conditions. That is proof of what can be achieved when institutions function and when rhetoric is replaced with results.  Four years ago  I spoke at this Assembly about Georgia being a test case for the modern challenges of democratic transition. Today  it is clear that Georgia's transition has led to real transformation. I could recite a long list of other successes since the Rose Revolution and  equally  I could elaborate upon the many profound challenges that remain. But let me focus on what is perhaps our most important duty; the imperative to create a better future for the next generation.  We will not rest until every school in Georgia is filled with empowered and confident students  who have the benefit of new books  a modern curriculum  full Internet access  many computers  until every student gets a computer  and motivated teachers. Just four years ago our schools were barren and desperate - many lacked desks  windows  heat and  above all  hope.  Today  reforms in education are sowing the seeds of lasting prosperity  and our students are leading the way. That is the Georgia we promised. And that is the Georgia we have created. It is also the Georgia we will and we must defend.   For our democratic project is not yet complete - far from it. Georgia today is not whole. The vast majority of residents from the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been unable to reap the benefits of the Rose Revolution that I have just shared with you.   Tens of thousands of children in these regions are raised amidst the sounds of gunfire instead of fireworks. Their homes are not their own  and their dreams are distant and frightening. They are prisoners of the morally repugnant politics of ethnic cleansing  division  violence and indifference.  But we will not rest until justice is restored  until the rule of law is accessible to everybody.  Today  I regret to say that signs of hope are few and far between. The story of Abkhazia  where up to 500 000 men  women  and children were forced to flee in the 1990s  is of particular relevance - one of the more abhorrent  horrible and yet forgotten ethnic cleansings of the twentieth century. In the time since Russian peacekeepers were deployed there  more than 2 000 Georgians have perished and a climate of fear has persisted.  It is worth pausing to remember that today's Abkhazia is populated by less than 20 per cent of its pre-war population. It is an area with very fertile land  beautiful beaches  lovely resort areas and wonderful landscapes. Yet it is all deserted  houses have been destroyed  and signs of hopelessness  desperation and annihilation abound.  The brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing uprooted ethnic Georgians  Armenians  Estonians  Greeks  Jews  Russians and others who had lived peacefully in that land for centuries  creating a depopulated and criminalized wasteland.   President Ilves of Estonia spoke today of the parallels between Darfur and Abkhazia. Of course  we should remember Darfur  but we should not forget Abkhazia. President Ilves knows of what he speaks because tens of thousands of ethnic Estonians were also deported and their houses confiscated. In 1992  the Estonian Government had to evacuate some of these people by air under the fire of the people that were attacking this peaceful middle-class population in Abkhazia.  The United Nations has tried to bring peace to this region  but it has not succeeded in making Georgia whole again  despite its unwavering recognition of Georgian sovereignty. Every day that passes without a peaceful resolution to the conflict  every day in which forcibly displaced persons are not allowed to return home  marks a slow erosion of the credibility of this House and of its ability to fulfil its mission. We cannot allow this situation to continue.  Fourteen years have passed without a single in-depth analysis being carried out as to why peace has not triumphed or why the legal framework has not been restored and has therefore failed. For this reason and in order to inject a new and positive dynamic into the process  I am calling on the United Nations today to launch a comprehensive review of all aspects of the Georgian peace process. The necessity of this review of the peace process is self-evident  and it must result in fundamental changes.  Changes are necessary in the negotiation format  which has stalled  and is stagnant and counterproductive. That in turn must lead to real changes in operations on the ground. Years of biased and unbalanced actions by supposed peacekeeping forces must be replaced with competent and neutral ones that will be engaged in peacebuilding and peacemaking  rather than in trying to maintain the so-called status quo  while in fact being biased and preserving the injustices that have happened there.  That is the only path forward. Out of this process  we can expect genuine and relevant changes in the legal framework. Although we need effective economic rehabilitation  the main thing we need is a meaningful and implementable plan to bring about the return of displaced persons  guaranteeing their property rights  the establishment of lasting security and the resumption of direct dialogue on the ground without any preconditions and without any adverse movements from sides that are against dialogue.  Because of the lack of political will  countless lives in that part of Georgia are being wasted. And inaction has its costs.  One of the greatest voices for peace in the last century  Martin Luther King  captured the essence of the problem when he said:  ""Man's inhumanity to man is not only perpetrated by the vitriolic actions of those who are bad. It is also perpetrated by the vitiating inaction of those who are good"".  Let us fill the vacuum with new energy  new commitments and a new common resolve. I want to take this opportunity to elaborate on the foundations of our proposals for a lasting and peaceful settlement. First  we offer the alternative of security and prosperity to those who have been poisoned by the separatist illusion. We offer and recognize the right to full self-governance for all who live in Abkhazia and South Ossetia  within our sovereign territorial borders under international guarantees. We offer constitutional changes to enshrine the protection of minorities including language rights  the protection of culture and education. And we are even willing to offer special property rights to all interested groups in order to enhance their identities and to guarantee and secure that their long-term survival will be protected by the State and the international community. Finally  we offer and welcome a robust role for the European Union and a greater role for its engagement on the ground.  In short  we offer a level of autonomy grounded in the very same principles that have guided the rest of Europe in promoting peace and prosperity throughout its multi-ethnic tapestry.  The continued ignorance of the ethnic cleansing in Abkhazia  Georgia is a stain on the moral account book of the international community. These disputes are no longer about ethnic grievances; they are about the manipulation of greed by a tiny minority of activists  militants  militias and their foreign backers  at the expense of the local population  the displaced and those who are deprived of their property and fundamental rights - even the right to speak and study in their own language.   The choice is between a Georgia that is willing to welcome them back with every constitutional recognition of their identity and their rights or a bleak future where they are the objects of propaganda  fear and poverty  and where they are pawns in a big geopolitical game.  I have faith that we will succeed.  Their masters and foreign manipulators will not succeed.   Where does the international community stand? My dear friends  that is the essence of the issue.   But the violent hold of the armed separatists and their patrons is not unbreakable. In South Ossetia  the courage of the people  of common men and women who have chosen dialogue over division  and reconciliation over recriminations  is making a difference. Unfortunately  those who do not share a vision of peace and reconciliation have chosen to oppose peace in South Ossetia  fearful that the power of the people and the desire to live in freedom may undermine their cynical plans.  As I speak before you today  elements from Russia are actively and illegally building a new  large military base in the small town of Java  in South Ossetia  in the middle of Georgia  on the other side the Caucasian ridge  very far from Russian territory  hoping that arms and violence will triumph over the will of the people. And this dangerous escalation is taking place under the very noses of international monitors  whose job it is to demilitarize the territory.  I have brought a very conclusive body of evidence with me today  to show our friends in the international community the truth that others conceal. I bring that disturbing fact to the Assembly's attention because reckless acts such as that must be highlighted and countered. Our collective job today is not to ask how this is possible. Rather  it is to act with determination and unity. We have all the evidence  we have video footage  documented facts and all the other evidence  and we will present it to the international community  to anybody who has voiced interest in this issue.  Sooner rather than later  the march of liberty will prevail. In the past year  the residents of South Ossetia have started down a different path. They are seeking to participate in Georgia's economic growth  to benefit from our new hospitals and our revived schools and to share in and contribute to our democracy. It is the ordinary residents of South Ossetia engaged in extraordinary acts of heroism who are making a difference. It is the children who took their summer holidays on Georgia's seacoast  only to return home and be barred from their schools or menaced by official authorities  who will tear down the barriers of hate. It is the residents rebuilding their towns under gunfire. I have specially met with the workers who continued to build schools  movie theatres and even discos under the gunfire of elements that wish to stop them. These are very courageous people of different ethnicities who want to live in peace and who are willing to take risks  even with their own lives for the sake of peace and a better future for their children.   It is the courage of local leaders such as Dmitry Sanakoev  a former separatist leader of South Ossetia who once bore arms against Georgia  who will lead the way. He was chosen by the people of South Ossetia in democratic elections to represent them. This vision will be embraced. I believe we should respect the courageous expression of the ethnic Ossetians who have decided to take that path within Georgia. The only obstacle to the integration of South Ossetia is a separatist regime that basically consists of elements from security services from neighbouring Russia that have no historical ethnic or cultural links to the territory whatsoever. I think that is a very temporary development Now is the time to seize this historic opportunity to avoid the escalation of violence  which is a possibility and a major risk  especially in the territory of South Ossetia.  In closing  I would like to share the insights of a woman whose name is on our minds and in our hearts today: Aung San Suu Kyi. Her courage  her resolve and her reflections on peace and democracy  cannot be imprisoned. They travel across every border and barrier to inspire us all. Her words are of profound relevance to the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. I believe they also must be a beacon for all of us in this Hall.  ""Even under the most crushing State machinery  courage rises up again and again  for fear is not the natural state of civilized man. It is man's vision of a world fit for rational  civilized humanity which leads him to dare and suffer to build societies free from want and fear.""  Those words poignantly reflect what is taking place today in the streets of Burma.  In our own corner of the world  for the past four years  the people of Georgia have invested their own sweat and treasure to build such a society - one free from want and fear. We now must ensure that Georgia whole and free includes all the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.   I believe I have been clear in stating Georgia's intentions and equally clear as to where we are unshakeable in our principles - principles  I stress  that are shared by all nations that seek legality and stability in the international system.  We are committed to a peaceful and honest path. Unfortunately  our interlocutors do not seem to be. This morning  a senior Russian official made the very unconstructive  unsubstantiated and untrue accusation that Georgian forces killed two innocent people in Upper Abkhazia. What the senior Russian official failed to say  however  is that one of the people was a lieutenant colonel of the Russian military and that he was killed during a law enforcement operation against armed separatist insurgents. One has to wonder  what was a lieutenant colonel in the Russian army doing on in the Georgian forests  organizing and leading a group of armed insurgents on a mission of subversion and violence? I want to ask our Russian friends: is there not enough territory in Russia? Are there not enough forests in Russia for Russian officers not to die in Georgian forests  on Georgian territory  for them not to fight on foreign territory for God knows what cause for their nation? Whatever the explanation  we regret any loss of life. That person was recruited from Russian peacekeepers and State and local militia. We do not wish anybody such an end to their life.  Indeed  we will do everything possible to avoid violence and further hostility and confrontation. This reckless and dangerous pattern of behaviour must not continue.  In conclusion  I want to express the gratitude of Georgia for the efforts of the United Nations and its staff. I trust that I have demonstrated that we have the opportunity and  in Georgia  the desire to resolve our common challenges so that the international community can commit its resources to resolving the great challenges of our age. Let us not lose any more time. "
"63",2620,"GHA",62,2007,"Permit me first to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. The Assembly is certainly the richer for the wealth of diplomatic experience that you bring to the job.  Yesterday there was a vibrant debate in this Hall on the critical issue of climate change  which is a main theme of this year’s session. The phenomenon of consensus among contributors portends catastrophic impact on the whole globe  but more especially on poor countries  which are least equipped financially and technologically to adapt in a sustained manner. Since it is generally accepted that the threat is universal  it is Ghana’s considered view that the United Nations should be vested with the authority to fashion a full-fledged agency equipped with the necessary scientific and technological resources to study the problem globally and to focus on where and when it is going to occur so that  through the organization  such places can be prepared  with due warning and relief  to adapt to the impact.  Leaving the problem to individual nations  especially in the developing world  cannot be the way forward. There should be shared responsibility  even if various solutions are sought. In any case  this menace must be tackled on an emergency basis by the Organization and all its Member nations  individually and collectively  for humanity’s survival.  On 6 March 2007  Ghana celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its independence as a sovereign nation. Ghanaians were overwhelmed by the incredible level of goodwill from well-wishers around the world. Permit me to use this occasion to convey Ghana’s heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the members of the Assembly and  indeed  to the rest of the world for the singular solidarity displayed to us on that occasion. May all the peoples of the world become one and be at peace with each other.  In line with its independence ideal of freedom of justice and a jubilant spirit of renewal  Ghana has rededicated itself to respect for human rights  democracy  good governance and sound economy to enable its people to develop their full potential for sustained national development.   Again  recalling its role in Africa’s liberation struggle against colonialism and apartheid  Ghana has once more committed itself to working in harmony and union with sister African nations and also in partnership with the global community  as far as it is feasible  to end years of impunity  exploitation and bad governance  which have undermined the economic growth and development of the continent. Henceforth  all energies should be directed at empowering the continent through accountable and transparent governance  economic growth and sustainable development to enable it to tackle the myriad problems that afflict it and to facilitate its launching into mainstream globalization.  In July this year  Ghana had the honour of hosting the ninth Ordinary Session of the Summit of the African Union in Accra. The sole agenda of the Summit was to stage a grand debate in search of a continental union government to accelerate the growth and development of Africa and its peoples in a sustained manner. After very frank and fruitful deliberations  the Summit firmly resolved to launch certain necessary steps towards achieving that laudable objective.  To pave the way  the Summit continues to place high priority on the resolution and prevention of conflicts within and among member nations. The African Union Peace and Security Council is tasked to develop a robust and dependable security architecture on the continent  including the setting up of an African standby force as soon as possible. Those initiatives  which are supported by the international community  have already helped to reduce significantly the high incidence of armed conflicts  which have been common on the continent over the past four decades.   In line with our concerted efforts to restore peace and stability in Africa  the prevailing crises in the Darfur region of the Sudan and in Somalia and the Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict must be resolved. Similarly  measures to consolidate peace in countries that are emerging from conflict  such as Burundi  Guinea-Bissau  Côte d’Ivoire  Liberia  Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  must be substantially supported by the Organization and the international community to avoid a relapse.  To that end  we commend the efforts of the Peacebuilding Commission  whose first annual report (A/62/137) highlights the challenges associated with post-conflict reconstruction and development of countries such as Sierra Leone and Burundi. As a member and a Vice-Chair  Ghana will work diligently with other members to achieve the goals of the Commission.   We also welcome Security Council resolution 1769 (2007)  authorizing the deployment of a hybrid operation in Darfur  with the consent of the Government of the Sudan  and call for its speedy implementation within the agreed time frame. Here  we acknowledge the tireless joint efforts of the African Union and the Security Council  which finally got the Government of the Sudan and the Darfur warring factions to resume dialogue.  We also recognize the special initiative being taken by Secretary-General Ban and the Libyan leader  Brother Muammar Al-Qadhafi  to get the remaining warring factions to join the dialogue in order to achieve full-scale and rounded negotiations.   Meanwhile  the ongoing peace initiative in Somalia is proving extremely challenging and well beyond the capacity of the African Union alone. We are therefore calling for the concerted and timely support of the United Nations. In that respect  we urge the Organization to consider the African Union’s request for financial  logistical and technical support towards the full and effective deployment of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). That will be within the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 1772 (2007)  adopted in August 2007. It will enable Member States  such as Ghana  which have pledged to contribute troops to do so. A contingency plan for the possible deployment of a United Nations force to replace AMISOM by next February must also be developed.  Decidedly  Africa is making progress  with improvement in the macromanagement of many African economies. Average gross domestic product growth has increased steadily  from 5.2 per cent in 2005 to 5.7 per cent in 2006 to the current 6 per cent  which is expected to be sustained or even exceeded in coming years. Africa is therefore more than ready for good business. This is evidenced by the increasing interest shown by both local and foreign investors. In the mean time  the African Union’s agency  New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  is seriously engaged in studying viable projects that should prove strategic to opening up the entire continent and its economy for accelerated developments. Energy  communications and infrastructure development rank highly in this.   The African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) is also a NEPAD creation. The Mechanism has already proven helpful in deepening respect for human rights and democracy  as well as transparent and accountable governance. Indeed  as more countries voluntarily subscribe to it  the Mechanism’s real value as a creative and ingenious process for addressing many of the root causes of conflict is becoming evident. The General Assembly’s decision to endorse NEPAD as a framework for cooperation with the African Union is  therefore  timely and appreciated.   There has been a general improvement in the relationships between Africa and the various developed parts of the world and regional blocs. This is reflected in various initiatives including the Millennium Challenge Account and the African Growth and Opportunity Act of the United States of America; the African  Caribbean and Pacific agreements with the European Union; the Tokyo International Conference on African Development with Japan; the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation; the Indo-Africa Forum for Cooperation and the Africa-Brazil forum  among many others.   Despite this trend  however  there is still a serious gap in official development assistance. This must be bridged quickly to enable struggling African nations to attain the Millennium Development Goals. The developed partners are  therefore  urged to fulfil their pledges.   On the world trade talks  we urge them to commit seriously to the aid-for-trade appeal as a critical principle in the Doha Round. Similarly  on the proposed economic partnership agreement  the European Union should agree to relax the timeline for conclusion. They should also agree to review timelines for trade barriers and procurement  given that the rather weak economies of many African  Caribbean and Pacific nations might not be able to withstand the shocks of implementation in the short to medium term without some adjustment.   The Secretary-General’s proposal to establish the Office for Disarmament Affairs within the Secretariat to be part of the decision-making process is timely  owing to the proliferation of small arms and light weapons and the menace of terrorism. In many places in the world  these dangers together constitute the real weapons of mass destruction. Ghana welcomes initiatives like the restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the establishment of the Department of Field Support. The latter initiative will not only reduce the work of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations but will also help to promote its efficiency  accountability and transparency.   The General Assembly's approval of the overhaul of the system of administration of justice at the United Nations  for the first time in 60 years is also long overdue and commendable. However  Ghana urges the Organization to reflect also on mechanisms for the enforcement of the judgments of the International Court of Justice.   Conflicts  particularly those in the developing world  have consistently undermined policies to improve the circumstances of our peoples. Sustainable development can be achieved only in an international environment of peace and security. The United Nations remains the main and the best multilateral instrument available for guaranteeing such an environment and for promoting fruitful international cooperation  especially in this era of globalization. All its Member States should  therefore  be committed unequivocally to its ideals and purposes.   To conclude  permit me once again to wish the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Godspeed during his tenure and to assure him of Ghana’s continued cooperation and support.  "
"64",2666,"GIN",62,2007,"I  should like at the outset to convey to all members friendly greetings from Guinea  its people and its President  General Lansana Conté. To the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session and to the Secretary-General of our Organization  I wish to convey the same greetings and to express our heartfelt wishes for every success.  The agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly places before us all the essential issues challenging the world: the maintenance of international peace and security  the development of Africa  the promotion of human rights  climate change  the promotion of justice and international law  disarmament  the fight against illicit drugs and the fight against terrorism. Those subjects are timely today  but they were also timely yesterday and will probably remain so tomorrow. They are part of man’s long attempt to meet the principal challenge facing him since the dawn of his existence nearly 3 million years ago: his survival.  Today more than ever before  that survival is threatened by a serious lack of respect for the environment. Man emerged from a hostile natural environment  which he tamed in many ways before he began to dangerously threaten it through his appetite for absolute power and his desire for comfort and well-being. Where will this tyranny end? Science has sounded the alarm  although the mobilization consists more of words than of deeds  more of intention than of reality. In this very Hall  during the High-level Event on Climate Change  we absorbed all the information provided by scientists  who concluded that action was urgent. It is paradoxical to note that  after having searched desperately for life on other planets without finding it  man does not realize that  for the time being  he is unique in the immensity of the cosmos.  That unique existence in the Milky Way must continue at all costs  and that is within our reach. The determination that inspired the Organization’s founding nations to put the world’s affairs in order and forever banish the spectre of war should be the same determination that leads all nations of the Earth to take concrete and immediate measures to put an end to environmental degradation.   Every time human beings have wanted to do something  they have been able to do it. However  that resolve should not contain secret vices. For example  it should not consist of imposing restrictions on poor countries’ use of their forest resources  as if such restrictions were an angelic service to humanity. A balance is possible between environmental protection and the essential will to achieve development. A number of great world leaders have advocated just compensation to Africa for the exploitation of its natural resources. Africa should be grateful for that.  But the continent’s needs go well beyond that. Africa no longer wants to be confined to the simple role of supplier of raw materials; it wishes to process them in order to create more jobs and added value so as to create more wealth. The technologies that need to be transferred today are those that guarantee better productivity while respecting the ecosystem.  The issues facing humanity today cannot be addressed by any one country in isolation. The United Nations  because it embodies our common destiny  must be the place where our fears  our anxieties  our visions and our proposals  but also our hopes  come together. But if it is to play such a role  the United Nations must be just and equitable both in its structures and in its decision-making mechanisms.   The Second World War  which was the tragic vehicle that fortunately led to the establishment of the United Nations  spared no nation  race or continent. Reform of the Security Council in particular and of other United Nations organs in general must take account not only of that historic reality  but also of the inevitably universal nature of the problems besetting us.   How can we put an end to terrorism unless we take into account the ferment that would characterize the dialogue among civilizations  cultures and religions and enhance mutual understanding and tolerance? How can we overcome HIV/AIDS if profit remains the criterion that guides the pharmaceutical laboratories? How do we put an end to the inexorable degradation of the environment when powerful corporations care little for the future of the planet? How do we eradicate the scourge of drugs when drug traffickers are irresistibly drawn to easy money? All of those questions call for solidarity  vision and joint action. We cannot improve on the brilliant and poignant analyses that have already been made here in this legendary Hall  but the difference that we can make is to take action.   We should remember that many of the commitments entered into on many fronts have not been respected by the United Nations  nor by the groups of countries represented in specific organizations. Allow me to give you several examples.  In 1974  the most highly industrialized countries promised to eliminate world poverty in the year 2000. That was a mythical year  the year 2000. For that purpose  they undertook to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to official development assistance.   In 1989  15 years later  amidst the euphoria arising from the fall of the Berlin Wall  the same Powers foretold an era of universal peace by the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century. They foretold that the funds previously dedicated to the arms race would henceforth be devoted to accelerating the eradication of poverty  which they said would become effective in 2000. Unfortunately  those predictions were disproved by reality.   Poverty in the world has certainly not been eliminated  it has increased since the beginning of the 1990s. Over 100 million people joined the ranks of the poor in 2003 alone. In September 2000  in this same Hall that  at the time  applauded those aborted hopes  the heads of State and Government of the world adopted the Millennium Declaration. The Declaration implicitly recognized the inescapable nature of poverty  rejecting the goals set in 1974 and admitted that it would only be possible to halve the number of poor people in the world by 2015.   Today  midway towards the achievement of the goals of that Declaration  which did  however  crystallize so many dreams and hopes for the younger generations of the world  all the experts’ reports agree that the Millennium Development Goals will only be achieved if we change the strategies and rules that shape our world today.   Instead of a new dawn of global peace  localized wars that rip through the protective membrane of the entrenched and now-defunct bipolar global system now appear in successive waves in Europe  Africa and Asia. The nuclear threat has not disappeared. Is nuclear energy  whether put to civilian or military uses  actually essential to the life of mankind? Nuclear power certainly is useful when used for civilian purposes  but will always be a threat to humankind   both for those who possess it and those who aspire to possess it   when used for military purposes. It is the logic of rivalry between nations that has led to the logic of the arms race and the theory of deterrence is only a subset of that logic. The best deterrence is the total absence of nuclear weapons.  The effort to combat terrorism is another challenge  the challenge that is played out in a Manichean manner  evil and good opposing each other. Although no attenuating circumstances can be granted to those who subscribe to the philosophy of terror  the realities on which that philosophy seems to be based must nevertheless be eradicated: injustice in the management of world affairs  intolerance in the perception of differences between cultures and cynicism expressed in the theory of natural differences among races.   The success of human rights and worldwide democracy is to be won at that price. Indeed  the great Western Powers  who have guaranteed so much to their peoples in terms of freedom  equality and respect for the fundamental values of mankind must show greater rigor in peacefully promoting the same principles at the global level. They currently give us cause to believe that they frequently choose their immediate interests above the principles in which they believe  although they have good reason to believe in those principles.  All of the heads of State and Government of the African continent and of many other countries that have come before this rostrum have eloquently addressed the issues confronting poor countries. I would like to only briefly touch upon them. Trapped in a vicious circle resulting from the conjunction of bad governance  ever-growing poverty and the Gordian knot of irreducible external debt and unfair capital markets  poor countries are steadily deteriorating. Often transformed into sanctuaries for rebel armed groups  they have become the site of civil wars  with their trails of refugees and massive population displacements. Those devastated societies feed migratory flows and provide an ideal refuge for the mafia networks of organized crime. The traffic in small arms and light weapons knows no borders and the weapons end up in the trained hands of child soldiers.   I do not believe in the inevitability of poverty nor in that of war. Failures in those areas can be clearly explained. The dominant groups of the rich countries and the elites who are charged with governance in poor countries are both responsible for the failure of the fight against poverty and for not having met the commitments taken in 1974. What is worse  they have given preference to commercial  financial and technological policies and strategies that have reinforced the causes of the ongoing impoverishment of poor populations worldwide. With respect to the failure of the pledge for universal peace  it is due to the concepts and political strategies put in place by the dominant groups and leaders of the world who have opted for reaction over prevention.  There are solutions to counter poverty and to bring the world out of this pattern of permanent war. Inspired by the shared destiny of mankind  our dream of universal peace still has every chance of coming true. It would involve promoting a global economic system based on a series of common goods and global public services that must be provided and overseen by the global collective. That is certainly not out of reach.   To eradicate poverty  we must declare it illegal in principle and unacceptable as a phenomenon. Declaring that poverty is illegal means specifically abolishing the legislative and administrative provisions that sustain the mechanisms that create and maintain poverty around the world. It is that new momentum of commitment and collective responsibility towards the eradication of poverty and towards guaranteed peace that will open the way to resolving the many other major challenges that face our time. Of course  the question remains; is our contemporary society  replete with its unprecedented global capacities in the area of know-how  technologies  finance and mobilization of human resources made up  in its essence  not of conquerors but of builders of peace and security who are sufficiently courageous and daring to be able to change the current patterns that mould and forge our world?   Let us take an example from the nineteenth century  which was a time when the world was successful in initiating the process of completely eradicating the age-old practice of slavery  which had until then been considered to be natural and immutable. That required the courageous leaders of the time to declare the practice illegal  at the cost of their own lives at times. The heroic victory of the Allies during the Second World War was due to a commitment of a similar nature. Similarly  was it not thanks to their firm commitment that the major leaders of the world recently succeeded in abolishing the shameful system of apartheid and replacing it with a democracy of exceptional vitality?  If leaders of that calibre illuminated our past  I am confident that there still exist today those who are capable of changing our world to make a happy legacy for future generations.  In January and February 2007  the Republic of Guinea was beset by an unprecedented socio-political crisis that threatened its social stability and the foundations of its institutions. The cause was the convergence of a cumulative lack of good governance  rampant poverty and an overall economic situation in which all of the financial and monetary indicators were in the red. These tragic events  marked by considerable loss of human life  led to massive destruction of public buildings and involved a great erosion of State authority  creating  at the same time  profound rifts in the social fabric.   Fortunately  the outcome  although it remains fragile  was a peaceful one and is under the auspices of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations. It is owes its existence to the combined efforts of the presidential authority  the unions  civil society  eminent persons and friends of Guinea worldwide.  From this rostrum  I express the deep gratitude and great thanks of the people and the Government of Guinea to all those entities and individuals who were involved to ensure that civic peace would reign in our country.   The Government that came out of these events  a Government that it is my privilege to lead  is doing its utmost to try to meet the many expectations of a people that has become impatient because it has waited far too long. A minimum emergency plan was crafted for the short and medium terms.   Let me conclude by saying that the initiatives planned for by my Government  as promising as they are  continue to be dependent upon the interest that world leaders give to all the subjects that I raised due to my deepest convictions. Beyond the commitment of our elites and civil society to good governance and democracy  the Republic of Guinea needs an effective partnership in keeping with its specific and pressing needs. This partnership  for which the Guinean people wholeheartedly calls  will be more appropriate  effective and lasting if the dominant groups of the world agree to commit to global solidarity in the service of humankind’s development.

"65",2705,"GMB",62,2007,"Let me at the outset congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly and to reassure him of the Gambia’s full support and cooperation during his tenure in office. Let me also use this opportunity to express our appreciation of the excellent manner in which the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Mrs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa managed the affairs of the Assembly at its sixty-first session.  My delegation would also like to use this opportunity to once more congratulate our new Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his assumption of the leadership of the United Nations. The Gambia is particularly delighted that Mr. Ban had the opportunity to address the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the African Union during his meeting in Banjul in July 2006. His subsequent election  surely can only be a source of pride and delight for us.  We also wish to commend him for the initiative he took to convene a high-level event several days ago on a subject that is of great concern to all nations and peoples of the world  namely  climate change. All the salient issues surrounding this phenomenon have been brought to the fore. It is now our fervent hope that action will be taken to address them in a most timely manner.   The mid-term review of the Millennium Declaration two years ago indicated that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are far from being attained in most of the developing world. This notwithstanding  our commitment to the MDGs is unwavering. The overarching policy objective of the Government  under the leadership of the President of the Republic of the Gambia Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh  is to reduce poverty and achieve all the MDGs. We have just concluded a second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper  which clearly sets out our policy framework for achieving growth and poverty reduction  despite our meagre resources and endowments and despite the failure of several partners to fulfil their pledges of aid  debt relief and market access for African countries. The same mid-term reviews also showed that the commitments that were made in many forums by the international community in support of the MDGs in poor countries have not translated into real resource flows into these countries.   We therefore call on the international community to rededicate itself to the provisions of the Monterrey Consensus and the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. In this regard  my delegation welcomes the panel of eminent personalities established by the former British Prime Minister  Mr. Tony Blair  to monitor pledges made at summits of the Group of Eight  including those made at Gleneagles. My delegation considers it particularly critical to take action to reverse the downward trend in overseas development assistance.  We also need to re-examine the framework of key rules that govern  inter alia  international trade and finance  global competition  foreign direct investment and international migration. It is important that bodies making rules in those areas accommodate the views of developing countries in general  and least developed countries in particular. For Africa  where we must of necessity move away from aid dependency  the development of the continent must be addressed from the crucial vantage point of trade and market access  so as to enable our economies to be advantageously positioned in order for us to begin enjoying the fruits of globalization.  My delegation would like to seize this opportunity to request the Assembly to pause for a moment and reflect on the plight of the poor the world over. Poverty anywhere  we will all agree  is indeed a problem everywhere. And it is worth remembering that the plight of the poor can affect the comfort and security of the more privileged and affluent members of human society. There is no doubt that poverty engenders many economic  social and political problems. It negatively affects global health and is a threat to international peace and security as well.  Therefore  the need for greater international solidarity to fight poverty in all its forms and ramifications cannot be overemphasized. The development efforts of most Governments  particularly those in Africa  continue to be undermined by the scourges of malaria  HIV/AIDS and other health related issues  such as hunger and malnutrition. I must thank our true friends and development partners for the excellent support they are providing to the Gambian people  particularly in the areas of health  education  and agriculture. It is my fervent hope that the international community will live up to its commitment to support the efforts of our Government as we strive to improve the well-being of our people. In order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015  which we should all consider to be a necessary condition to affect people’s living standards  Africa sorely needs significant investments in health  education  agriculture and infrastructure.  Allow me to turn to peace and security in the world  especially on our continent of Africa. In recent years  we have witnessed significant improvements in most of the continent. In West Africa  for example  we have been consolidating peace and deepening the democratization process as well.   The people of Sierra Leone have just gone through a peaceful  free and fair presidential election. My delegation would like to congratulate them and to wish the new Government all the success in its efforts to follow the path of rapid socio-economic development for the Sierra Leonean people. The return of peace to Côte d’Ivoire is a welcome and a vital development not only for the country and its people  but also for the entire West Africa subregion. The Government of the Gambia fully welcomes the Ivorian Government’s commitment to organize presidential elections shortly  and we wish the friendly people of that great country every success.  The situation in Somalia requires the urgent response of the international community. Lasting peace  stability  and reconciliation can return to that country only when the Transitional Federal Government is empowered to establish law and order. The United Nations  as the overall guardian of international peace and security  should support the efforts of the African Union (AU) in that regard  and Somalia’s neighbours as well  to rally the various factions together and bring lasting peace to that country. As we gather here  thousands of innocent civilians  including women and children  continue to be victimized by the fratricidal conflict in the Sudanese region of Darfur. My Government therefore welcomes the commitment of the international community to replace the existing African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) with a hybrid United Nations-African Union mission  invested  of course  this time around  with a more active mandate to keep and enforce peace in Darfur. We in the Gambia have been in the forefront in the African Union’s peace efforts in Darfur  and we will certainly continue to support the international effort with a substantial contribution of Gambian troops to serve in the new arrangement. At this juncture  let me salute the Sudanese Government for their cooperation and their manifest willingness to find a lasting solution through a political process.  The peace and security situation of the Great Lakes region remains a major concern. While we welcome the successful elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo last year  we recognize the fragility and precarious nature of peace in that country and the region as a whole. My delegation therefore calls on the international community to continue to work to search for ways of achieving durable peace. We also urge the international community to assist in bringing all the parties to the negotiation table and to move vigorously to address the humanitarian situation.  Just as the security and peace situation in Africa preoccupies my delegation  so also do the conflicts and turmoil in the rest of the world  especially in Iraq  Afghanistan and Palestine. The conflict in Iraq remains a major source of concern  not least because it now threatens the peace and security of the entire Middle Eastern region  if not the whole world. Within Iraq itself  the conflict has brought untold suffering to the civilian population especially women and children. Furthermore  the alarming rate of civilian deaths cannot be justified.   Also  the resultant large volume of refugee outflows has now placed unbearable pressure on the economies of  in particular  the neighbouring countries. While we recognize  of course  the potential of refugees to make positive contributions to the economies and societies of their host countries  refugee outflows of the magnitude that we are seeing in Iraq can only pose a threat to social and political security. We therefore strongly urge that as a matter of urgency  alternatives be found in order to resolve the conflict in that country.  A new approach to the situation in Afghanistan is also long overdue. The country needs more political dialogue than military engagement. We also wish to see leaders in the region engage each other in meaningful dialogue and  of course  renew their commitment to good-neighbourliness as well.  The unresolved question of the self-determination of the Palestinian people remains the most important political and moral question of our time. A few years ago  we all placed our faith in the so-called Road Map for peace and hoped that the Quartet would bring about the eagerly awaited two-state solution.   My delegation now very much welcomes the new initiative being led by the United States of America and very much looks forward to the convening of a conference that would once and for all settle this festering imbroglio. We urge all concerned to come to the table in good faith and with a strong will to make a positive contribution to the search for a lasting solution to the problems of peace and security in the Middle East and  indeed  in the peace process throughout the world.  Allow me to highlight some issues relating to international justice. The illegal  outrageous and protracted embargo imposed on the friendly Republic of Cuba has no basis. It is devoid of political and commercial sense  and those who impose the embargo should join our ranks in the international community in rejecting the embargo as a colossal error of judgement that should never have happened in the first place. We hope to see a repeal of all laws  measures and policies in that direction.  The Gambian delegation sincerely hopes as well that the international community will reflect deeply on the dangers posed by the increasing and unprovoked militarization of the Taiwan Strait. Regional and  ultimately  international stability are under threat from the build-up of thousands of military warheads for use in attacks on Taiwan. The problem of the Taiwan Strait is one that is very serious indeed  and which calls for urgent action by the international community. The United Nations should not wait until it is too late to address the situation of the Strait and its growing militarization.  We  the Members of the United Nations  have at this juncture abdicated our responsibilities towards Taiwan by refusing it full membership in the Organization. The legitimate aspirations of the people of that dynamic  technologically developed  advanced economic powerhouse ought to be fulfilled by States Members of the United Nations. Let me seize this opportunity to assure the Assembly that my delegation is not acting against the interest of any Member State. Rather  we speak out in the interest of peace across the Taiwan Strait  peace throughout the Asia-Pacific region and  indeed  peace in the whole world. It is in that spirit that my delegation will continue to call on the General Assembly to address this threat to international peace and security.   Mr. Beck (Palau)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Let me conclude by putting on record the Gambia’s frustration with the stalled reform of the United Nations. As former Secretary-General Kofi Annan said when the proposals were first made  two years ago  no reform of the United Nations can be complete without reform of the Security Council. For us in Africa  it is just unacceptable that a body that decides on life and death issues for millions of Africans includes no African country at all as a permanent member. That is why the Gambia continues to strongly endorse the Ezulwini Consensus  which represents Africa’s common position on reform of the Security Council.  At a time when we are all committed to good governance at the national level  we surely cannot ignore good governance at the international level. The proposed reform of the United Nations  especially as regards the Security Council  must be seen within that context.  I wish us all a very successful session. "
"66",2745,"GNB",62,2007,"First of all  I would like to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. His great attributes will contribute greatly to the success of our work. I would like to assure him of the constant support of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau in the realization of his noble mission.  I would also like to extend my warm congratulations to the President’s predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain  for the talent and competence she displayed during her tenure.  I would also like to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the excellent work he has done since his election. We fully agree with the contents of his report and with his analysis of the international situation. We endorse the measures he has recommended.  The prevention and peaceful resolution of conflicts and the maintenance of international peace and security occupy a central position in the Charter of the United Nations. It is therefore the duty of all Member States to make efforts to achieve those noble objectives. We believe that the establishment of an international coalition for peace  international security and the promotion and defence of human rights is the ideal way to promote efforts towards the resolution of conflict.  Terrorism and drug trafficking are scourges that threaten all of us and can even gravely affect the stability of a country. Guinea-Bissau  like many other countries in West Africa  is confronting the phenomenon of drug trafficking. The weakened infrastructure of the State and the problems we face in controlling our borders   in particular our waters   have made it possible for drug traffickers and other organized crime elements to flourish in our country. That has resulted in many sorts of difficulties for our authorities  to the point of damaging Guinea-Bissau’s image and putting at risk our relations with the international community.  Despite the Government’s political will and determination to combat drug trafficking  we have not been able to put an end to this scourge. Its eradication will only be possible through international cooperation. The emergency plan to combat drug trafficking developed by my Government illustrates my country’s determination to make the fight against the trafficking of drugs and organized crime a national objective. Unfortunately  however  we do not have the trained human resources or the material and financial means needed to carry it out.  I am pleased that an international conference on drug trafficking in West Africa will take place soon. We would like to thank the Portuguese Government for its willingness to host it in Lisbon. Likewise  a regional conference to be held in Dakar will seek to promote better coordination between the countries of the subregion.   I would like to launch an appeal to all countries able to share their experience and technology relating to drug trafficking and organized crime to assist us in the fight against those criminal activities  which jeopardize the internal security and stability of our countries and pose a great danger to our young people. In that regard  I welcome the efforts of the United Nations system to establish a genuine international network to eradicate this scourge.  The Government of Guinea-Bissau has decided to launch programme to address problems in the financial sector that will serve as an adjustment instrument vis-à-vis international financial institutions. That step will certainly allow us to re-establish and strengthen the framework for interaction and external partnerships of cooperation for development. The approval of a post-conflict programme by the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund will be an important step towards achieving the country’s economic recovery and stabilization.  We are aware of our responsibilities to manage transparently the meagre resources at our disposal and to combat corruption through good governance based on true democracy.  The disbursement of pledges made during the donors’ conference for Guinea-Bissau in Geneva last November is much-needed in the political and institutional stabilization of our country. It goes without saying that without the firm support of the international community  it will be difficult for us to put in place the conditions necessary for the consolidation of stability and for the promotion of true national political reconciliation  which is essential if we are to preserve peace and achieve sustainable development in Guinea-Bissau.  Allow me to pay tribute to subregional organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States and the West African Economic and Monetary Union for their constant support and solidarity  from which we have benefited in our efforts to confront the enormous political  economic and financial difficulties we face. I would also like to welcome the important contribution made by the International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau to improve dialogue between international development partners and to mobilize external assistance for my country at a particularly difficult moment in our recent history.  It is also important to emphasize the role played by the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau of the Economic and Social Council.  I wish to express our thanks for the contribution of the United Nations system in general  as well as that of the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNOGBIS) in particular  in the process of establishing peace and political stability in our country.  The relationship between the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries and the United Nations has been developing in a steady and satisfactory manner. We draw attention to the progress already made in consolidating democracy and the rule of law as well as in promoting respect for human rights in the Community. This constitutes a marked change in the life of the peoples of its member States. Indeed  our eight countries   Angola  Brazil  Cape Verde  Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique  Portugal  Sao Tome and Principe and Timor-Leste   are committed to pooling together their affinities and their cultural identities in order to establish a forum for exchange  in a spirit of constant and active solidarity. My country  Guinea-Bissau  has benefited from the support of these sister countries in tackling the many difficulties I have outlined. On behalf of the people of Guinea-Bissau  I warmly commend the leaders present here  and thank them  reiterating our determination to strengthen the historical ties of friendship and cooperation among our peoples.  Allow me also to reaffirm our determination to contribute to strengthening the role of the United Nations in attaining peace  international stability and development. We support the peaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion of dialogue in all circumstances and situations. History teaches us that change  because it is inescapable  cannot be hindered indefinitely.   China is one nation  one people. The People’s Republic of China’s contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and its partnership  especially with regard to cooperation for development  are exemplary. The People’s Republic of China is the sole  legitimate and true representative of the Chinese people.  We are aware of the problems and the difficulties which we confront in the world in general  and in Africa in particular  where conflict situations and humanitarian crises persist  as in Darfur and in Somalia. We hope that a new spirit of cooperation will prevail within the international community so that a lasting solution and peace can be found in the Middle East.  We therefore need an effective Organization that represents the geographical  cultural and religious diversity of the world  an Organization that takes into consideration and defends with equal commitment and determination the legitimate aspirations of a large number of countries for just representation and participation in the deliberations and decision-making of the Security Council.

"67",2784,"GNQ",62,2007," On behalf of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  I should like to join previous speakers in expressing our support and congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the Republic of Macedonia on his election to preside over the debates of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. We congratulate him because his country is an example of freedom and democracy and because  for the United Nations  the sovereign equality of States   whether large or small   is a principle of respect for dignity  justice  equality and peace throughout the world. We are convinced that under his far-sighted leadership the Assembly will ensure that those principles are observed and respected by all.  We also congratulate his predecessor  Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  on her great political skill in serving the interests of the international community at a time dominated by wars  conflicts of interest and natural disasters.  In addition  we commend the laudable work of the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who deserves our full support so that United Nations intervention can be effective in conflicts and situations threatening peace  stability and the well-being of nations.  Equatorial Guinea is participating in the present session of the General Assembly with uncertainty regarding United Nations efforts  which are drowning in a vicious circle of good declarations of principle and technical and scientific definitions  which are ethically motivated but which ultimately fail to attain the objectives of the peace  security  development and well-being of humanity  which inspired the establishment of this world Organization.  Indeed  the fact that  despite so many preventive resolutions  we are focusing this year’s deliberations on atmospheric degradation  which currently poses a threat to humanity because of nuclear tests; the proliferation of chemical industries with military purposes  which are destroying vital elements of the environment; the use of chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in armed conflicts; and the irrational use of non-renewable natural resources  which is destroying ecosystems   activities that do not seek the common good of humanity  but that have caused the destruction of the ozone layer and the breakdown of the components of the planet’s atmospheric equilibrium. This is an obvious sign that our resolutions are being ignored. The tsunami  if it was not the result of a nuclear test  must be the consequence of this atmospheric deterioration  which has now increased the number of floods  hurricanes  fires  cyclones  earthquakes and volcanic eruptions throughout the world.  Nevertheless  for more than 20 years the United Nations has undertaken praiseworthy initiatives to reduce spending on these activities and to use the surplus on development in the poorest countries. Despite that  no favourable response has been made by the countries owning these industries. Nor has the Kyoto Protocol itself   which obliges States to reduce their emissions of harmful gases   been ratified by all the States Members of the Organization.  Equatorial Guinea believes that the phenomenon of climate change must be addressed by the United Nations with the same intensity with which it is currently addressing issues that include  among others  democracy  human rights and the threat of terrorism.   It is correct to say that climate change is a challenge for all States  because its effects are truly harmful to everyone. But we cannot ignore the fact that the primary responsibility lies with those who developed  for their own interests  the technologies that are destroying the ozone layer. The countries of the tropical forests of the Congo Basin in Africa and the Amazon Basin in South Africa cannot make use of their own forest resources  because they must contribute to the maintenance of the ecosystems that help to maintain the ozone layer. However  there are no compensatory policies to avert the economic resource crisis occurring among the affected peoples.   My Government is now committed  in the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol  to processing the gas produced by the oilfields of my country and its neighbours into liquefied gas for the benefit of humanity. Nevertheless  Equatorial Guinea cannot manage to benefit from the credits offered by the international financial institutions and bodies  because we qualify as a middle-income country  whereas it is known that we have produced oil for only 10 years and have never had any development infrastructure.   Our uncertainty is even greater when we consider the problem of development financing for the least developed countries. In our view  no bilateral or multilateral cooperation policy has shown itself to be capable of meeting the basic development financing needs of poor countries. Because of a lack of political will  everything is reduced to political conditioning factors and requirements that cannot be met by countries seeking to develop. In that regard  Equatorial Guinea has not been informed of the fate of the 0.7 per cent   an insignificant amount   that developed countries were to give from their gross domestic product for the financing of the least developed countries.   Nor has the question of the cancellation of the external debt of least developed countries and their interest been welcomed by creditors  despite their historic obligations. Our experience over many years has shown us that Equatorial Guinea cannot develop if it does not have its own means and if it does not take principal responsibility for it.   Thus  once oil resources were discovered  the Government organized  in 1997  the first national economic conference in order to plan better use of these resources for the short  medium and long term. The programme adopted has been implemented in a manner satisfactory to the people and Government. Now we can organize the second such national economic conference  in order to plan the development of the country for a sustainable economy. From this rostrum  we would like to invite bodies of the United Nations system and friendly Governments and international economic institutions to participate in this conference in Equatorial Guinea in the first two weeks of November this year  in order to help us by sharing their experiences.   Humanity has never been threatened and frightened as much by terrorism as over this last decade. Terrorism used to be known as a process for the settlement of accounts through violent means by those who felt powerless to see their claims met through legal and democratic processes. It has now reached different dimensions  which do not uphold legitimate claims  nor are their effects directed only against persons or institutions from which rights are being demanded. Any third-party country can be a victim of terrorism today  as if it were a country against which the demand may be lodged.   The result is that today terrorism is a threat against humanity. It violates individual and collective freedoms  impedes the exercise of democracy  violates the peace and security of nations and stands in the way of the development of peoples. All countries of the world that love peace  justice and freedom have the duty and the obligation to combat this phenomenon  which is a form of regression of the human species.  However  there seems to be a tendency to ignore another  similar phenomenon  namely  the use of mercenaries  that practice of resorting to force to destabilize legitimate political regimes for whatever reason. In the case of Republic of Equatorial Guinea  it has been clearly shown that the invasion operation against our country by mercenary groups in 2004 was organized to gain access to oil. The masterminds behind that operation  clearly identified  were leaders of Governments of States Members of the United Nations. Since these facts came to light and were denounced by my Government  we have not had any condemning reaction from specific Member States or friendly countries in criticism of the barriers to bringing to justice the perpetrators of that operation  which means that they would probably be happier had the invasion of my country been successful  with the inherent dramatic consequences.  If we want to combat terrorism and the use of mercenaries  we need to rely on well-developed internal security systems and to exchange information among States. We have to be faithful and show solidarity with the principles of the equal sovereignty of States  non-interference in internal politics of other States and the resolution of controversies by peaceful means  giving priority to dialogue  consultation and tolerance. We should adamantly condemn any terrorist act of intimidation and destabilization of States and take actions of solidarity against such acts  because they threaten State sovereignty and the free will of people.  Finally  if we are looking at reform of the United Nations today  it is because the objectives that support this world Organization  their very principles  have been and are being systematically violated. The United Nations has gone through many changes: from an organization aspiring to a universal consensus to one comprised of interest blocs; from an organization with universal goals for the well-being of humanity to an organization of the stronger against the weaker. Today  the reason for a veto in the Security Council is not so much the necessity of preventing abuses of power by some against humanity as it is an eagerness to defend the partisan interests of groups or individuals. Thus  although a veto in the Security Council does not mean anything today because resolutions are not much observed  Africa also has its own interests to defend. Thus we want the right of a veto to be conferred on the continent and not a State  because that continent represents a third of humanity.  The future of humanity is in our hands. Each one of us must feel committed to meeting the challenges of our time so that new challenges can become new hopes for people. May God guide us in our deliberations. "
"68",2830,"GRC",62,2007,"The  great challenges and problems  both global and regional  call for urgent and coherent responses. The responsibilities and the role of the United Nations in raising awareness and in providing unity of direction are now greater and more important. That is exactly why compliance with United Nations resolutions should be a top priority for all  including those are elected to represent the Organization and its agencies.   I should like to congratulate Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa   who was only the third woman in the history of the United Nations to occupy the post of President of this Assembly   on her efforts to promote the purpose and principles for which our Organization was founded.  I should also like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to safeguard international peace and security and for his keeping alive the authority and role of the Organization in this area.  Greece fully aligns itself with the statement made by the Prime Minister of Portugal on behalf of the European Union. However  we would like to add a few points about the major issues on our agenda for the coming period.  The end of the Cold War ushered in a new era in international relations in which the threat of military confrontation between the two power blocs dissipated. However  the world community still faces violent internal conflicts  civil wars  genocide and other large-scale atrocities that cause immense destruction and suffering to millions of people.  And yet  conflicts within and between States are not the only threat to international peace and security. New threats and challenges are emerging. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a serious challenge. Organized crime and human trafficking constitute another threat that can have destabilizing effects and fuel civil wars. Extreme poverty in many parts of the world  failing States  large-scale humanitarian disasters  deadly infectious diseases and environmental degradation and catastrophes have devastating consequences.  We applaud the Secretary-General’s initiative to hold a high-level event last week to deal with climate change  environmental issues being potentially the greatest threat to our societies. I hope that a global  sustained and comprehensive approach emerges soon to help save our planet  our future  our children’s future.  Controlling and coping with climate change is one of the greatest environmental and development challenges. Without swift action to face the problems arising from these challenges  we all risk paying a high and bitter price.  We should proceed in a timely manner  through a step-by-step approach  building on national as well as international capacities in order to address the causes  mitigate the effects and create synergies that will allow for specific and measurable results in the near future. A clear indication of the importance Greece attaches to the environment is the fact that the Greek chairmanship of the Human Security Network has decided to focus on climate change and human security.  This summer my country suffered enormously from devastating wildfires. May I take this opportunity  while addressing the international community  to express our deep gratitude and thanks to all those countries and friends who have extended to us their invaluable support  help and assistance.  Working for peace is not an easy task. The pursuit of international peace and stability  if it is to be successful  means that threats have to be addressed in a comprehensive way and that many conditions have to be met. Unresolved conflicts have to be energetically confronted  while  at the same time  we have to deal with situations of deep-seated injustice  inequality  ongoing violence  social exclusion  extreme poverty  famine  illiteracy and cultural misunderstanding.  In addressing the deep-rooted structural problems that fuel conflicts  peacebuilding must bridge security and development. Good governance  the rule of law  strong democratic institutions  respect for human rights and development assistance are critical components in reducing today’s conflicts.  Terrorism is undeniably one of the most serious threats to peace and security  menacing the very foundation  of our democratic societies  and actions to combat this threat should be in conformity with international human rights standards and fundamental freedoms. The adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by the General Assembly was a major accomplishment  and its full implementation should be an absolute priority for Member States. In this respect  I would like to emphasize the importance that my country attaches to the conclusion of ongoing negotiations for the elaboration of a comprehensive convention against international terrorism; it would be a valuable addition to the counter-terrorism legal framework.  In the face of all the threats and challenges that transcend State borders  we need a more comprehensive concept of collective security  one based on respect and justice as requirements for peace and solidarity as a condition for security  and entailing a commitment from all to promote sustainable development. But above all  we need a commitment to collective political action requiring the strengthening of the United Nations.  The early  comprehensive and coherent prevention of conflicts lies at the heart of the United Nations mandate for the maintenance of international peace and security. Integrated and long-term strategies to address the root causes of conflict are necessary. The United Nations should therefore be strengthened in its managing  resolving and preventing conflicts and their recurrence. International regional organizations should also be effective in this regard  and international treaties should be respected.  The United Nations was created on the basis of the resolve of all States that collective action was the only basis for taking measures to address our common global problems. We only have common values enshrined in the United Nations Charter that guide our efforts and give us direction to unite around what is just and right   freedom  democracy  human rights  equality  peaceful resolution of conflicts  respect  multiculturalism  tolerance and open societies  and dialogue among neighbours  nations  religions and cultures. Greece’s foreign and security policy is based precisely on these principles and values. We are committed to the peaceful settlement of disputes  the upholding of international law  including international humanitarian law  and promoting good neighbourly relations.  I deeply regret to note that  33 years after the Turkish invasion in 1974  the Republic of Cyprus remains a divided island. Turkey continues to occupy part of a United Nations and European Union (EU) Member State with over 40 000 troops  violating United Nations resolutions and international law. Our steadfast objective remains the withdrawal of all occupation troops and the reunification of the island  in the context of a bizonal  bicommunal federation. To this end  the relevant United Nations resolutions and the EU principles and values provide a clear framework for a comprehensive settlement agreed upon by the two communities.  Greece has consistently welcomed the United Nations initiatives for finding a just and viable solution to the Cyprus question. In this vein  we strongly support the rapid implementation of the 8 July 2006 agreement  which was reached under United Nations auspices. We shall continue to do everything possible to assist the two communities to find an agreed solution  not least because it would significantly enhance the development of friendship and cooperation between Greece and Turkey. We strongly urge Turkey to demonstrate the necessary will and flexibility towards this direction.  Our foreign policy is based on the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter. It is in this spirit that we approach our relations with neighbouring Turkey. Greece has taken specific steps and initiatives to continue broadening and strengthening our cooperation with Turkey in all fields. Lately  it has grown even further in the economic field  but also in the energy sector. We believe that a democratic Turkey with a clear European orientation  a Turkey that meets the European criteria and requirements set out in the negotiating framework with the European Union  can be a factor for stability in our part of the world. That is why we support Turkey’s European aspirations. Turkey  however  must concretely demonstrate its unequivocal commitment to the principles of good neighbourly relations and peaceful settlement of disputes with all its neighbours. In any case  from the outset Greece has repeatedly stated that Turkey’s full compliance should lead to full membership.  Good neighbourly relations are the cornerstone upon which the countries of South-East Europe must build a common European future of peace  stability and prosperity. The European perspective of the countries of our region has been a strategic choice for Greece. Our vision is to transform our neighbourhood into a region that is like the rest of Europe   an area of peace  democracy and prosperity. As the oldest member of the EU and NATO in the region  my country works intensively and constructively to create the necessary conditions of good neighbourliness  mutual understanding and stability in the Balkans.  Enhancing regional cooperation  establishing good neighbourly relations and finding mutually acceptable solutions to outstanding issues with neighbouring countries are fundamental prerequisites for further integration of the aspirant countries of South-East Europe into the Euro-Atlantic institutions. Provocative acts and statements with irredentist connotations are incompatible with United Nations principles and common European values. They poison the necessary climate of understanding between our peoples  and they are contrary to the European concept. In this context  Security Council resolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993)  calling for a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  need to be respected in practice by all. Our efforts to secure a truly European future for the Balkans will remain inconclusive if we fail to reach a viable and sustainable settlement for Kosovo’s future status. We remain convinced that this goal can be met only if  first  effective compromises between the two parties are achieved in the course of the ongoing negotiations and  secondly  if the settlement is legitimized through a Security Council resolution. In any case  this is par excellence a European problem  and the role of the European Union in this issue is essential.  I cannot think of any conflict that has held the unwavering attention of so many for so long as the one in the Middle East. We are all aware of the multifaceted challenges that we face in this part of the world. And we all agree that the nature of these challenges is such that they affect not only the peoples of the region  but the entire international community. Despite the variances that we observe among us  there is one crucial element that is common to all  and that is the need to achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle East based on a two-State solution that will guarantee security  mutual respect and a fair future for all. This is our common goal  and Greece is deeply committed to it.  The progress Africa has been making in recent years is both substantial and undeniable. It is characterized by economic growth  crisis management and a will for conflict prevention. The United Nations  deeply involved in peacekeeping and providing developmental assistance  has found in the African Union and the African regional organizations a vital partner for the success of this process. Partnership between the United Nations and the African Union  as well as the African regional organizations  could well be the key to successfully overcoming the challenges facing Africa today. In this context  we welcome the creation of the joint African Union/United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID)  which  by combining forces of the United Nations and of the African Union  shows the way to the future for Darfur and for the continent as a whole.  International development cooperation is one of the priorities of Greek foreign policy. Our national development agency  Hellenic Aid  implements the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in the framework set out by the European Union and the principles followed by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  while focusing on our cultural heritage. Our humanitarian and development projects in 46 countries aim at combating poverty  disease  malnutrition  lack of access to drinking water  and dealing with the consequences of natural disasters and conflict situations  while safeguarding the protection of human rights. We strive to address the root causes of illegal immigration  human trafficking and terrorism  since enforcement measures alone are not enough to address those problems. In 2005  Greece allocated $384.22 million to finance actions to the benefit of our partner countries in the developing world. In Africa  development assistance  ranging from humanitarian aid to HIV/AIDS care and refugee programmes  was offered to almost 20 African States.  On all the issues I have referred to  my country is committed to assisting the United Nations and to cooperating with all individual Member States in order to achieve peace and prosperity for all peoples of the world.

"69",2871,"GRD",62,2007,"I am honoured to join previous delegations in congratulating the President on his election as President of this Assembly at its sixty-second session. Let me assure him of Grenada’s unconditional support as he guides our important and crucial deliberations towards a fruitful and tangible conclusion.  I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mrs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  who laboured tirelessly during her presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-first session  and to her timely and productive initiatives. In addition  my delegation would like to renew its support to the Secretary-General in his endeavour to advance the agenda of the United Nations and to make it more effective.  In his opening remarks to this General Assembly the President identified five areas as our priorities: climate change  economic development  the Millennium Development Goals  terrorism and United Nations reform. Grenada salutes that vision in recognizing the critical issues facing our world today  and it is through this lens that I would like to project the views of my country.  On the question of climate change  we applaud the Secretary-General for convening the recently concluded High-level Event on Climate Change  and we are satisfied that this will provide the stimulus and momentum required for the forthcoming negotiations in Bali. Indeed  for this sixty-second session  my delegation welcomes the tremendous emphasis being placed on climate change and  based on the statements made thus far  we are heartened to note the overwhelming commitment to preparing a better world for our future generations.   The recently concluded event was not our first attempt. Climate change was also addressed in Rio de Janeiro  Barbados and Mauritius. It seems that we are blessed with a penchant for songs of praise in this multilateral temple of commitment and sacrifice. The chorus of our voices reverberates loudly in these halls of wisdom  only to sound a hollow note as we exit the archways of these chambers and backslide into reality. As in all of these conferences  the real challenge that we face is to convert what seems like a religious fervour into good deeds in the neighbourhood of our global village. As we preach  so too must we become converts. Let us move from resolutions to results.  As we head towards Bali  we must craft a negotiating table that extends well beyond the dimensions of the intergovernmental process. That table must have seats for the unborn generations  as well as seats for this generation wishing to taste the social and economic prosperity of a new world order.  Because of sea-level rise  we in the small island States face the spectre of environmental refugees and our people are already being displaced. For example  the Maldives with its 1 900 islands  that country has undertaken significant expenditure building sea defences and in creating safe zone resettlements for its people.  The low-lying islands and countries of the world deserve a far more robust and accountable response from the international community. In that regard  we welcome the investigation in the Maldives of the human dimensions of climate change.  As Grenada knows so well  the effects of climate change represent the most dangerous threat to the economic development  peace and security and territorial existence of small island States. We therefore welcome the efforts of the British Mission here in New York  which has worked ceaselessly to raise awareness and understanding of the threat posed by climate change  echoing the very concerns that many small States and low-lying coastal nations have raised over the last 15 years.  In fact  one thing that has become painfully clear to Grenada is how easily   in the blink of an eye   an entire country can be flattened. In our case  it was the eye of Hurricane Ivan. Hurricanes and cyclones are appearing in unusual latitudes and with greater ferocity. They are appearing further south in the Atlantic  affecting islands like Grenada  and they are appearing further north in the Indian Ocean and hit the Seychelles for the first time in 50 years. Just this summer we have seen two category five hurricanes  Dean and Felix  make landfall in the Caribbean within two weeks of each other  causing loss of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.  In Grenada’s case  the destruction was twice its gross domestic product. However  with the help of God  the resilience of the Grenadian people  the help from our Caribbean and international friends including the United States of America  and with the leadership of my Prime Minister  we continue our aspirations to build back better. In that regard  I would like to pay special tribute to the People’s Republic of China  whose generous assistance and commitment to our development have been greatly appreciated by the Government and the people of Grenada. Because of their help  Grenada was able to host Cricket World Cup 2007 at our new stadium  which was financed and constructed by the People’s Republic of China.  Despite all concerted efforts  climate change has led to a downward assessment of our sovereign credit rating and Grenada is now under the guidance of the International Monetary Fund. Grenada cannot borrow money on the international market to replant its nutmeg  to mend its coastal infrastructure  or to upgrade its tourism industry. As a result  we have imposed a reconstruction levy on our people  at a time when global energy and food prices are increasing. The economic burden of global warming is hitting the pockets of ordinary women and men in the streets of Grenada  the poor farmer  the hardworking teacher and the waiters and waitresses in our hotels. Those ordinary island citizens are paying the price for the lifestyles of the major emitters.  A new paradigm is needed within the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions. Within that paradigm must lie an understanding that small island developing States have an environmental and economic vulnerability that warrants a new set of metrics  a new set of rules and a new level of support.  As we head towards a post-2012 agreement  we need aggressive mitigation targets. Those targets are critical for us  because sea temperature rise is already causing bleaching of the coastal reefs. Loss of those ecosystems has a harmful impact on fish stocks  one of our main sources of protein and foreign exchange.  The Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre has said that a further one degree temperature rise will lead to significant loss of tuna and dolphin stocks. And to compound the matter  in Mauritius and the Seychelles  tuna stocks are diving deeper seeking cooler waters. In recent years  the fish catch has dwindled and revenues have diminished. To alleviate those problems  more investment is now needed in new studies  as well as in fishing technologies  equipment and practices.  As we approach the Bali meeting  Grenada reiterates its position  articulated by the Alliance of Small Island States  that the viability and adaptability of the most vulnerable  such as small island developing States  must be the fundamental benchmark against which all negotiations are framed. In the efforts to mitigate climate change  no nation must be left behind. Let that be our guiding principle  if we are to make meaningful progress in Bali.  While these negotiations are ongoing  my country and many other islands and low-lying countries are taking all necessary steps to cushion the fallouts and dislocations. Adaptation funding and funding for economic development are almost indivisible.  Grenada calls for the urgent completion of the institutional arrangements for the Adaptation Fund  in a manner that guarantees that priority should be given to the needs of the small island developing States. On the question of the Global Environmental Facility  we welcome the energy  enthusiasm and flexibility of its new Chief Executive Officer. We are  however  disappointed with the implications of the Resource Allocation Framework. Nonetheless  we look forward to strengthening the working relationship with the Facility following reforms that make it more responsive to the needs of small island States. Climate change  energy  economic development and the Millennium Development Goals are so tightly interwoven that over the long term  we cannot tease out any one thread without weakening the fabric of our common aspirations for prosperity and peace.  It is well known that women are the most affected by poverty and suffer the highest levels of marginalization. As the United Nations continues its study of the issue of gender architecture and the general advancement of women  Grenada sees the empowerment of women as being critical for our own development. We therefore urge other States to contribute to the many bodies of the United Nations that promote and seek to secure avenues for women in the development process. Let us contribute to their budgets and not to their demise; for even if only a few benefit  that sets the stage for others to follow. In our view  the advancement of women represents a most powerful force for social and economic progress. Investment in gender mainstreaming is an investment in social justice  economic diversity and political stability.  The United Nations must lead by example. Guided by the tenets of the Millennium Development Goals  Grenada is working assiduously to improve the status of women. Several years ago only a few women held high political or other public offices in Grenada  but today we are proud to report that approximately 50 per cent of the Cabinet of our executive branch is made up of women and that many others hold top positions within the public service.  The challenge facing the vulnerable States of the world can be resolved only if we ourselves transform our thinking and reform our methodologies. For that reason  we support the revitalization of the General Assembly. My delegation joins the call for the expansion of the membership of the Security Council in both categories to allow for a Council more representative of the 192 States and five regions which it represents. That way we can achieve much in assembling a stronger and more powerful Council which will be better able to fulfil its mandate in a fair  just and transparent manner.  Grenada  as small as it is  has the honour to highlight its humble but valuable contribution to the securing of stability in Haiti. This year Grenada has increased its deployment of police personnel to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. We encourage others to give whatever support they can  no matter how minute  to the efforts of international peacekeeping initiatives. We are  however  hopeful that very soon our unit and others like it will no longer be needed.  In closing  I must indicate that despite the challenges I have outlined relating to our economic viability and territorial integrity  we still have to pay close attention to terrorism and other threats to world peace and security. Grenada therefore remains steadfast in its commitment to the international community to fight terrorism in all its forms and to ensure that the seeds of that poisonous weed never take root on our shores. Grenada is convinced that a free and democratic world is our best hope and therefore pledges its full support towards the betterment of lives worldwide. I call on all nations  big and small  rich and poor  to contribute even more to that noble task.  We are all obviously singing from the same song sheet. Let us harmonize the sound of our voices to amplify action for the citizens of our world. It must echo triumphantly across the generations  so that when it is replayed with fidelity to our children and our grandchildren they will listen with dignity  and not with disdain. "
"70",2918,"GTM",62,2007,"It has been barely two weeks since I initiated in Guatemala an electoral process that will conclude on 14 January  when I will have the honour to bestow the presidential sash on the person elected democratically by my people. That event will have two consequences: first  representative democracy will be strengthened further in Guatemala  based on an electoral process that even international observers have described as very satisfactory.  Secondly  this is my last appearance before the General Assembly  an occasion which I take advantage of in order to attest my support to the United Nations and to greet our new Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  and the incoming President  Mr. Srgjan Kerim.  Now that we have only a few months before handing over power in Guatemala  I wanted to give a brief account of the main accomplishments of my administration  within the framework of what we consider a successful history  despite the problems that continue to besiege us. After overcoming an internal conflict that lasted four long decades  this story reflects success not only for Guatemala but also for the United Nations  the Organization that is so closely tied to our Peace Accords. It is precisely those agreements that encompass our main objectives  namely strengthening the State’s democratic institutions  promoting economic and social development  fighting against poverty and social exclusion  fully respecting human rights and building a multicultural  multiethnic and multilingual Nation.  Allow me to reveal some of the accomplishments of the past years. First  one of the successes of our administration was improving the quality of public management through the creation or strengthening of public institutions  the articulation of coherent policy programmes combined with specific actions and in many instances  updated legislation. It would be tedious to enumerate the multiple areas revamped  including diverse subjects such as food security  the energy sector  administrative and financial decentralization  governmental administration  the revenue administration  trafficking of persons and assistance to immigrants   the last subject is so dear to our concerns. At the same time  we have progressed in strengthening and creating new democratic mechanisms control institutions  invigorating the direction of ministries as well as enhancing result-oriented management  while all along integrating the main political aims with planning and budgets. In that context  we have built a State where public expenditure and biddings are subject to civil society scrutiny. Having instituted the “Guatecompras” programme and making it mandatory for the public sector  we have reinforced the commitment to work with transparency in all areas of government.  Secondly  in the last four years we have also achieved an economic recovery within a framework of a solid financial stability. We exceeded growth rates of 3.5 per cent in the biennium 2004-2005 by attaining 5 per cent in 2006 and 5.6 per cent in 2007. The overall poverty index fell five percentage points between the years 2000 and 2006  from 56 per cent of the population to 51 per cent  respectively. We acknowledge that ratio is still unacceptably high but the achievement of that reduction must inspire us to continue fighting to fulfil in Guatemala one of the main Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations. For that reason  public policy was redirected completely towards rural development  where the main social underdevelopment and poverty are concentrated.  One of the sources of the increasing dynamism of our economy has been the export sector  whether to Central America or to the rest of the world. All that effort has been impelled by our National Agenda for Competitiveness 2005-2015  and it has been complemented by a marked increase in investment in infrastructure  mainly in the rural areas. The commitment to reach better levels of competitiveness was also translated into the construction of a new international airport and the remodelling of six more  along with qualitative and quantitative improvements to seaports  as well as the rehabilitation  paving and extension of over 2 100 kilometres of roads throughout the country.  Thirdly  we have given an enormous impulse to social expenditure  particularly those destined for education  health and housing. The goals set forth in the Peace Accords of assigning 4.8 per cent of gross domestic product to social expenditures have been surpassed to reach 5.7 per cent in 2006  approximately twice the proportion of ten years ago.  Thanks to that redirection of policy and the strengthening of institutional reforms  particularly in education  the principal social indicators have begun to show significant improvements. For example  the net rate of school attendance at the primary level was raised from 72.6 per cent in 1997 to 95.5 per cent in 2006. At the same time  we achieved a higher rate of health coverage  thanks to the strategy adopted  under which another 4.1 million Guatemalans can access that essential service.  Fourthly  in the area of the inclusion of indigenous peoples  Guatemala enacted the Public Policy for Coexistence and the Elimination of Racism  under the aegis of the Presidential Commission Against Discrimination. Also  we have incorporated multicultural criteria into public policies  planning and projects; we have strengthened bilingual and intercultural education and we have instituted an affirmative action policy in order to increase the proportion of indigenous civil employees in the public sector.  Fifthly  during my administration a human rights approach was promoted in all public sector policies and during the past four years more public policies regarding human rights were enacted than during all the previous governments. In that context  allow me to mention just one aspect: the right of reparations violations has been acknowledged for victims of human rights and for that purpose we devised a National Plan of Compensation with a duration of 13 years in order to respond to all claims.  Finally  we addressed the issue of citizen security in an integral manner  a social phenomena conditioned by multiple economic  social  political and cultural factors  while at the same time insisting on the full observance of human rights. We recognize that there is still much to do in that area  but in practice definite and significant advances have been attained. To address new national and regional challenges that have arisen in regard to citizen insecurity and organized crime  my administration concentrated its efforts on strengthening public institutions and building democratic governance.  I must state that many of these policies should be conceived as State policies rather than those of a particular Government. In this regard  we have put into place a transition programme so as to transfer to the new democratically elected authorities  after the second round of elections to be held on 4 November  all the information deemed most relevant to facilitate the administration of the new Government.  Logically  our foreign policy was also inspired by the same principles and values as our domestic policy  which I have already outlined. Perhaps the area in which we have best managed to promote these objectives is here in the United Nations  which has worked with us in the negotiation  implementation and follow-up to our peace accords. We have tried to repay that support in a modest way with our contribution to peacekeeping operations in various parts of the world  particularly in our sister nation of Haiti  as well as through our active presence in various United Nations forums.   Given the circumstances  it is in our interest to preserve  to strengthen and to adapt to modern times our Organization  the United Nations  whose ideals we value so much. The United Nations occupies a special place in our foreign policy. We value it not only for its past role   the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala left the country at the end of 2004   but also for its continued contributions. In 2006  an office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  which works with and advises and counsels the State  was established. This month  September  a new concerted effort is being made between Guatemala and the United Nations with the collaboration of a group of friendly nations  through the creation of an International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG)  whose objective is to improve our investigation capacities and the arraignment and prosecution of criminal activities in our country. This is an unprecedented collaboration between a Member State and the United Nations  with a view to combating impunity  and particularly transnational crime  an endeavour that will surely yield very tangible benefits for my country and valuable experience for the United Nations.  We also reiterate our commitment to the Central American integration process  which has produced remarkable advances in the last four years. We are very close to securing our integration process by means of putting in place a customs union  and we are also embarking on a negotiation process with the European Union aimed at securing an association agreement.  Reviewing some of the other items on our agenda  on Monday of this week I had the privilege to take part in the high-level event on climate change  where I added our voice of alarm at the irreversible harm that we are causing ourselves owing to global greenhouse emissions. The amount of scientific data proving this phenomenon is unquestionable  and Guatemala has not been spared its effects. But we also have the scientific means to mitigate  and even reverse  recent tendencies  which requires a shared but differentiated effort on the part of all of us. The United Nations offers unparalleled forums in which to tackle this common threat. It is as serious a threat to humanity as are wars with weapons of mass destruction  or transnational terrorism.  I would like in the last part of my speech to talk about some of the items on the General Assembly’s agenda. I have the following specific comments. As a multicultural  multiethnic and multilingual country  we are proud to have worked hand in hand with other countries in the negotiations that led to the recent adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  As a member of the Human Rights Council  we have actively participated in its process of institution-building. We believe that the greatest challenge that the Council has to confront is to finalize that building process and to set in motion the universal  periodic review mechanism. Guatemala will be one of the first countries to be reviewed.  We are pleased at the holding of the first annual ministerial examination of the Economic and Social Council  aimed at appraising the progress achieved in fulfilling the targets and the objectives of development  as well as the launching of the Development Cooperation Forum. We support any reform and reorientation of the Organization that will enhance its ability to deliver results  coherence and efficiency. We take note of what has already been done in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  as well as the Secretary-General’s ideas for reforming the Department of Political Affairs. We are concerned  however  that the issues of reform relating to the development agenda agreed at the World Summit of 2005 are not being accorded the same priority.  Also  as a country that was a principal actor in the Financing for Development conference of 2002  we believe that the dialogue scheduled for 23 and 24 October will afford an opportunity to review the current achievements of its goals and to implement the undertakings set forth in the Monterrey Consensus.  In our capacity as a middle-income country  we were pleased at the holding of the Intergovernmental Conference of Middle-Income Countries last March in Spain  and we are committed to the success of the second such meeting to be convened in El Salvador in October.  We continue to await the much-discussed reform of the Security Council  and we note the advances attained during the last session of the Assembly  when we were closer than ever before to a process of intergovernmental negotiation. We trust that during this session those efforts will be pursued.  As I have said  this is the last occasion on which I shall come before the Assembly as President of Guatemala. I therefore reiterate my deep gratitude to the United Nations and to all its Member States for their support for our work and our initiatives during the four years of my mandate. "
"71",2961,"GUY",62,2007,"At the outset of my statement  I wish to offer the President and our  newly appointed Secretary-General my warmest congratulations and best wishes for the success of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly  which has as its main focus the impact of climate change on global peace and development.  As the recently concluded High-level Event revealed  there is now a greater awareness of that issue and of the need to address them with greater urgency. Like the legendary Rip Van Winkle  we appear to have finally awakened from a long and deep slumber  only to find that the world around us is in serious danger of degradation. Our environment has become frightening. As a result of the increased consumption of fossil fuels in past decades  the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by more than 25 per cent  which will  if unmitigated  eventually lead to a rise in the Earth’s temperature of more than 5 degrees in the years ahead. Such warming is likely to produce an increase in sea levels of almost 2 metres. Since one third of the world’s population lives close to coastlines  such an elevation will have a disastrous impact on the living conditions of many millions. At the same time  the world’s forests are said to be vanishing at a rate of 15 million hectares a year  threatening the loss of almost 50 per cent of the forest cover in developing countries. Altogether  those climatic changes will take a heavy toll on the economic and social growth of many countries  through a higher incidence of drought  desertification  flooding and other natural disasters.  The primary responsibility for this environmental degradation has been laid   quite rightly   at the door of those developed countries whose industrialization policies and programmes have shown scant regard for preservation of the global ecosystem. By piggybacking on the natural assets of developing countries  those States have achieved astonishing economic and social progress and have created consumerist societies whose appetites for ever-greater extravagance know no bounds and must be satisfied at all costs.  In the face of mounting evidence that climate change does in fact imperil the Earth and its resources  some developed States appear willing to accept   albeit reluctantly   that carbon emissions must be significantly reduced to preserve the ozone layer as a shield from the effects of greenhouse gases. Even so  they do not seem prepared to accept primary responsibility for protecting the environment. Instead of “common but differentiated responsibility”  they speak of “shared responsibility”  clearly demanding a greater contribution by developing countries to the campaign against climate change. This demand often becomes a conditionality for any development assistance they offer.  For the many developing countries which suffer from a chronic lack of resources  this imposition is clearly unequal and unfair. These States  including many in sub-Saharan Africa  small islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific  and low-lying coastal States like my own  are especially vulnerable to climatic changes and  consequently  disaster prone. The Barbados Programme of Action and the subsequent Mauritius Strategy were both devised for the purpose of alleviating the destructive impact of the many natural disasters faced by these disadvantaged countries. However  despite their initial promise  these agreements have yet to yield the measure of assistance needed by small States to overcome the consequences of climate change. Invariably  these affected countries must rely on their own limited resources to protect their environment from harm.  Guyana fully understood and responded to the challenges of climate change when  more than a decade ago  it made available to the international community almost one million acres of its pristine forest for the study of bio-diversity and the sustainable development of forestry. However  the future of this project is now threatened  since financial support from the international community has become increasingly scarce. At the same time  as our President stated at the High-level Event  the Kyoto Protocol rewards   quite perversely  I might add   those States which burn and pillage their resources but punishes others like Guyana which are committed to preserving their standing forests. This inequity should no longer be tolerated.  It is very important that any post-Kyoto agreement be endowed with the resources necessary for its full implementation. Development assistance statistics have shown a marked diminution in levels from past years  with little promise of the additional or new financing needed for environment-related projects. There  therefore  needs to be what has been called a partnership for additionality which  in return for a commitment by countries to the preservation of the environment  will provide adequate and predictable financing to allow them to pursue a path of accelerated and sustainable development. It is high time to honour the commitments made at the Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development.  As a country which is below sea-level  Guyana has been further sensitized to the threat of climate change as a result of frequent floods that wreak economic havoc on our coastal population. The last major inundation was in 2005  when the economic loss suffered was  according to the estimate of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean  nearly 60 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product. Unfortunately for us  the tragedy  occurring as it did around the same time as the tsunami disaster  did not feature prominently on the international radar screen and  therefore  received little notice in the wider community. However  thanks to the assistance of a few friendly countries and the resilience of our own people  we are on the road to recovery. That experience  however  impels us to renew our call in this Assembly for the strengthening of multilateral facilities to provide all victims of such natural disasters with prompt and adequate relief.  As both the outcome of the High-level Event and the statements heard so far in this Assembly make clear  the battle against climate change cannot be won unless a truly global effort is made to save the planet. In the words of my country’s national poet  Martin Carter  in his poem entitled “All are involved”:  Like a jig  shakes the loom;  Like a web  is spun the pattern;  all are involved  all are consumed (All are involved)  Therefore  unless all of us  both Governments and peoples  accept in a deep and meaningful way the imperative of prudent environmental management  our civilization  such as we know it  will disappear.  In this new era of globalization  humankind has been made acutely aware of the deep interdependence of nations and the concomitant need for cooperation with one another to ensure our common survival. This awareness notwithstanding  many in the developed world continue to practise their misguided “beggar-thy-neighbour” policy  which effectively precludes developing countries from satisfying the aspirations of their people.  Take  for example  the area of trade and economic cooperation  the main pillar on which globalization has been built. The developed countries continue to propagate the thesis that free trade will guarantee prosperity for all. The reality is that most countries  including my own  simply cannot compete successfully in fully liberalized markets unless they are assisted in making a gradual transition. Instead of assistance  however  some of the preferences that we enjoyed hitherto in some markets are being summarily withdrawn.  Witness the unilateral denunciation last week by the European Union of the Sugar Protocol  a legally binding instrument of indefinite duration  which governs the sugar exports of many African  Caribbean and Pacific countries to Europe. This step comes in the midst of negotiations on this issue and is clearly a sign of bad faith. It has been taken without adequate consultation and clarification and contradicts the European Union’s own lectures to us on partnership and good governance. As a result of this action  thousands of our citizens  especially the rural poor  whose lives depend upon the sugar industry  will likely face great hardship. It is  therefore  imperative that in the negotiation of future trade arrangements  including the Doha Round  due regard be paid to the development challenges of small States.  Similarly  in the area of peace and security there is continuing blatant disregard of the rule of law by many States that  in pursuit of their own selfish national interests  do not hesitate to fan the flames of conflict in various parts of the world. As a consequence  millions in Darfur  in Palestine  in the Middle East and elsewhere are forced to endure unspeakable pain and suffering   pain and suffering which  in today’s world of instant communication  we not only hear about but also actually see and feel in real time. Our common humanity obliges us to call once again for a return to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  and in particular the peaceful settlement of disputes  wherever and whenever they occur.  In this context  I am pleased to announce that last month on 20 September an arbitral tribunal of great eminence under the presidency of Judge Dolliver Nelson  distinguished former President of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  sitting pursuant to Annex VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  handed down a decision regarding the maritime boundary between Guyana and neighbouring Suriname. The President of Guyana described the decision as just and erudite; the President of Suriname called it fair and equitable. It was another feather in the crown of international law  another blow struck against the resort to force and another victory for lawful and peaceful processes in the settlement of disputes.   Guyana had initiated recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of the Convention  which  I am happy to recall  was brought into force by our country’s ratification in 1993. Under the aegis of a United Nations regime created by internationalism and the rule of international law  our two small countries can now pursue the development of their maritime space without the encumbrance of a dispute. It is an example of the peaceful settlement of a dispute that others might emulate.   In further demonstration of its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations  my Government has placed before the General Assembly an initiative calling for a new global human order based on the principles of equity and social justice. It is born out of our conviction that  given the failure of our past efforts  the world now needs to formulate a qualitatively different and more holistic strategy  leading to a stronger political consensus and broad-based partnership before the General Assembly. The draft resolution now enjoys the sponsorship of forty-nine States and will in time  we hope  command the support of the entire international community.  As this new era of globalization unfolds  with its many challenges and opportunities  I invite this Assembly to support fully our appeal for the firm establishment of a more enlightened and compassionate model of multilateralism as the cornerstone of future international relations. "
"72",3006,"HND",62,2007,"Allow me to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who has done a laudable job  thus enhancing the prestige of the United Nations.  I am here on behalf of the people of Honduras  who have entrusted to me the torch of Central American peace so that I can hold high in the Assembly Hall this light that illuminates understanding among peoples and nations.   Honduras is filled with a spirit of hope. Today we have the best social and economic indicators of recent decades. We have an average economic growth of more than 7 per cent. We have very good results in the area of job creation. We have begun to speed up poverty reduction by more than 6 per cent in 18 months. We have reduced forest fires by 40 per cent  together with illegal logging and the advance of migratory agriculture and extensive ranching. We now have a climate conducive to public and private enterprise. We are beginning to strictly implement the transparency law as a civic instrument to provide better access to public information.  We have already presented  during the recently concluded sixty-first session of this very special forum  the Assembly of the people  our demands  our proposals and a reaffirmation of our values. Most of the people of Honduras believe in democracy and social liberalism  and in a free-market economy in its true meaning  as a useful instrument for the equitable trade of commodities   the fruits of human labour.   However  in actual practice   the only possible means of testing our theories   international trade operates in an unequal and inequitable way  as do the relations between powerful and economically weak countries. Free trade  so highly touted in all our speeches and international propaganda may  if we do not redirect it properly  turn into yet another ruse disguising unequal relations  the unjust distribution of advantages and the undue  invisible code of unfair and discriminatory competition.   Let us just look at the figures of the World Trade Organization  which acknowledge that barely 7 per cent of international trade goes through free channels and the free market of economic and transparent rules. The rest  that is  more than 90 per cent of global trade  takes place outside the scope of the illusory standards of liberty and justice that we all aspire to.   We must remedy this situation. Now is the time. We must continue to establish the conditions to improve international agreements. I acknowledge that we are competing in imperfect markets with unequal rules of the game  which provide advantages and disadvantages. Some receive all kinds of subsidies and preferential tariffs  which transform their products into privileged goods. Speculative pricing  dumping  monopolies  oligopolies and other discriminatory practices are promoted  and certain parties are able to advance their interests and impose their will on those of us who are struggling just to reach the threshold of development.   We demand that the rules of true free trade and competition be respected. We do not want to be relegated to the basement of history. Our peoples have the right to reach the summits of prosperity.  One of the most obvious and classic examples of this problem  which is worth mentioning in this Assembly  is the excessive charges and increased tariffs imposed by the European market on the bananas from our region. A similar example is the recent revision request from the United States that we impose new tariffs on products and on the sale of textiles and finished fabrics that Honduras exports to the United States market. This weakens the spirit of the trade rules we signed barely a year ago and would affect Honduras’ sales to the United States market   a market that investors in our country have gained by dint of hard work  competing in order to sell at the best price and to sell goods of better quality.   As the Assembly can see  we are not coming here to ask for the impossible or to demand what is not owed to us. We simply want to go on record in expressing our just and necessary demand for equitable treatment in trade relations in the international market. We are not asking for sympathy or pious condescension. We are asking for respect. We want people to pay a proper price for our products and to value our effort and work with the same criterion that is used to rate the effort of other peoples and other communities that produce goods and services. We demand equitable rules and standards. We require the just treatment that we deserve as authentic and real members of this planet that we all share.   Likewise  we would like to mention in the Assembly a problem that almost all of us are experiencing. We are suffering the same fate because of speculative increases in the international markets in the price of oil and its derivatives. Barely five years ago  the price of a barrel of oil was about $13; today it is already above $80 a barrel. It has increased by a dramatic 600 per cent  thus subjecting our nations to a state of greater dependence and international destitution.   The economies of our countries cannot withstand this economic blood-letting  which destroys any attempt for social protection. A large part of what we can invest in order to combat illness  ignorance  hunger and age-old backwardness now drains to the large transnational oil corporations. While we are fighting to reduce poverty and its ills   ills caused by those who claim to be free of all blame and responsibility   the masters of the world and of trade are increasing prices to indecent scales as instruments of pressure with the rise of oil.   We are appealing to the global conscience to share urgent efforts to intervene in the extreme speculation in oil prices. We need to establish mutual cooperation in order to produce forms of alternative energy without it becoming a new opportunity to come up with low- or high-intensity wars that only threaten the sovereign rights and the right to strengthen peace of the democracies of the world.  These are the contrasts of the modern world. Paradoxically  while borders are opening up to speculation  abuse and free trade in commodities  they are closing to people  especially to emigrants. The lack of ethical limits of a society of unfettered consumption produces false expectations among young people in developing countries. Bombarded by alienating propaganda  illusions are created that later turn into urgent economic needs  producing diasporas compelled by the famous pursuit of the American dream.  There is no better opportunity than this universal forum to expand on a theme that concerns all of us   countries of origin as well as receiving countries. It is impossible to measure the drama of the emigrant experience  the modern self-exiles that go from place to place in search of better opportunities.  Honduras  my country  is a multi-ethnic and multiracial society and full of immigrants. My country throughout its history has been a territory of passage and a refuge for foreign migrants and a centre which has produced its own emigrants looking for a better life in far-off places. This triple status as a country of origin  a receiving country and a country of transit is what gives us the moral authority to talk about this topic with the necessary correctness and firmness  but also with indispensable feeling and solidarity.   To be an emigrant is not to commit a crime. Migration has not been and should never be considered a crime or threat  but rather a human right. Migration does not belong to nor should it be included in the security agenda of any country. That was done only in the time of fascism. It should be included and considered within the framework where it really belongs  that is  the development agenda of our countries. In this way  we would no longer witness the monstrous spectacle of inhuman persecution simply because people are migrants  undocumented aliens  pursued and humiliated. Emigration is a right  a simple and basic human right.   Those who see the problem of migration simply from the point of view of family remittances or voting by emigrants abroad are committing a serious and short-sighted error. They are wrong to look at the phenomenon of growing migratory flows in the world in this way. The problem is complex and difficult. It is related to the economic structure of the country that produces emigrants   political problems  natural disasters  war  violence  poverty  unemployment. Migration weakens the social cohesion of the country that produces emigrants  facilitates outflows of share capital and stimulates the fleeing of manpower at its most productive and hard-working stage. It empties communities  impedes the processes of democracy and generates unfavourable conditions because of which this wonderful working force is compelled to leave.  Migration is a very complex and contradictory social phenomenon that deserves serious scientific treatment  beyond simple emotions and feelings. Immigrants are people who are simply looking for better market opportunities in order to sell the only thing they have: their power to work  their energy  and their boundless desire to overcome their poverty and set out on the road to prosperity and well-being  which are basic elements of life. They are human beings who deserve to be treated as such and to enjoy the basic respect that humans should enjoy. They want us to recognize their rights and to give them responsibilities  to value and consider them in what they represent  and to see them for what they are: a productive and mobile human force that is vital and beneficial both to the economy that they serve and to the economy of their country of origin.  I propose that we provide a legal basis  a fair and legal international framework to ensure that immigration becomes an ordered phenomenon beneficial to all. I propose that we seek consensus  reach agreement and establish the necessary international cooperation. Our world needs immigrants and I implore its representatives  in the name of mercy and justice  to help stop the shameful persecution of immigrants. We must apply the law of family reunification. It is God's will that the families of immigrants be reunified.   All of us in Central America  Mexico and Latin America deeply regret the fact that we have seen no progress on the corresponding legislative initiative that the President of the United States submitted to the United States Congress. We know that he did so with the best of wills  and we therefore believe that President Bush should not falter in promoting that proposal. The construction of a wall can only separate us. We must find other mechanisms to resolve the problem. Halting the mass deportations and reunifying families would be a gesture highly appreciated in national and international public opinion. We also recognize the work of various Governments  in particular the efforts of President Rodríguez Zapatero of Spain  who has reached immigration agreements and quotas with various countries.  Just as the Kyoto Protocol protects biological life on the planet  the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantee life and peace in our societies. Let us ensure that they are implemented.   We express solidarity with peoples who are fighting for their identity  and reaffirm our support for the Republic of Taiwan in its efforts to achieve recognition in this forum of nations  in its fight for independence  and in its constructive and faithful dedication to the many development processes under way in Central American countries.   Central America and Honduras  El Salvador  Guatemala  Nicaragua  Costa Rica  Panama  Belize and the Dominican Republic are united by the dreams of Francisco Morazán  the champion of Central America  a region of leaders in contemporary continental thought and artists of stature throughout Latin America and the world  the belt of the Americas and a bridge to the world  in the words of General Omar Torrijos. Through me  they offer a fraternal and united invitation to visit. We have every facility. We have the most beautiful places on the planet  with great potential in such areas as tourism  bio-energy  telecommunications  agriculture and the environment.  We cannot remain passive or inactive in the face of social despair. Our lives are replete with dreams. We must  where necessary  overcome the neglect to which the developing world is subject. Our great poet and thinker  Alfonso Guillén Zelaya  said that we certainly cannot control fate. Prometheus always has to find someone to liberate him if civilization is to move forward. It is not possible for humankind to come to an end of its history without first giving the most disadvantaged peoples of the world the opportunity to live.   We trust in the future. Humankind knows that hope is not lost and has full confidence in the principles of the infinite god of love who guides us  and not in the god of violence  whom we reject. Before this Assembly  we express the fervent wish for peace in the world  a new dawn for humankind in which everything would be different and our energies would focus on serving human beings and not on trade. "
"73",3031,"HRV",62,2007,"When I first took the floor seven years ago to address the representatives of the States of the world on behalf of the Republic of Croatia  I started off with the words “time is running out”. At the time  I did not even imagine that I would have to repeat those very words seven years later  but with a greater sense of urgency. However  current circumstances  the problems facing us and our inability or inadequate ability to deal with them compel me to repeat  here and now: Time is running out.  When we attended the millennial session marking the beginning of the new century and the new millennium  we also formulated our millennial goals. Quite appropriately  we identified our tasks and our aspirations. However  what is not appropriate is the fact that the implementation of the Millennial Goals is not proceeding at the proper rate or in the proper manner if we want them to be meaningful.  We are running late; hence my warning: Time is running out. Among all global organizations  the United Nations is that which has been most sympathetic to the problems of developing countries and where loud and justified requests have been voiced to stop the stratification of the world into the haves and the have-nots. I have also attended sessions and conferences dealing with the issue  and I have repeatedly drawn attention to underdevelopment as a generator of global terrorism  along with inequality in international relations and unresolved regional crises. Nevertheless  underdevelopment and poverty still weigh upon a substantial part of humankind  and the preferred methods for fighting terrorism have so far been shown to be less than efficient  and sometimes even counterproductive. We are also running late in that regard  and time is running out here  too.  We have wanted and still want this Organization  our own Organization  to be fit for better and more functional action in current conditions. In other words  we want to reform the United Nations; we want to transform the Organization from a reflection of a world long gone into an instrument for safeguarding peace  establishing stability and ensuring development in the contemporary world and the world of future generations.   By declaring its candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council  Croatia wishes to affirm its commitment to the global Organization and its readiness to take part in its reform. I do not want to misuse the time at my disposal to lobby for that candidacy. Our deeds say more than our words  and our deeds include a successful struggle for national independence  despite an imposed war; the peaceful completion of that struggle through cooperation with the United Nations; a courageous confrontation of the past and of the truth about that past; the establishment of good relations with all our neighbours  including those that waged war against us; the promotion of the peaceful resolution of conflicts  always and everywhere; current participation in 15 United Nations peacekeeping missions  which puts Croatia at the very top of those countries whose soldiers are today maintaining peace under the blue flag. Let me emphasize that they are participating only in those missions that are under a United Nations mandate. In short  we are putting forward our candidacy as a mature European democratic country committed to the goals of the United Nations  and there is nothing more to be said about it.  As I have already said  we demonstrate our commitment by supporting the reform of the world Organization  but even in the realization of that noble and certainly unavoidable goal we are running late. Even among us  there are voices suggesting that we renounce the United Nations. There is less and less time for action. Even in that context  then  I must reiterate: Time is running out.  In recent decades  this Hall has heard many debates on the need to establish new political and economic international relations. Such new relations can be based only on equality. It is true that the high and the mighty have a greater responsibility  but it is also true that no one   no one at all   can or may have greater rights  much less usurp such rights by force  just as nobody’s rights can be denied by force. That holds true for global and regional developments alike. Unfortunately  force is still present in international relations  and on the European continent we are witnessing dangerous signs of a possible renewal of the arms race. Such a trend should be stopped and such conditions changed. There is not much time. Once again  time is running out.  By complying with the requirements of often uncontrolled development   and not only in the most developed countries   and by giving in to the aggressive needs of capital  guided exclusively by interest and never by social factors  we have agreed to condemn millions of people to death by starvation and for lack of basic medical care  and hundreds of millions to bare survival in poverty  with no prospects. However  by destroying nature  we have also jeopardized everyone’s survival. Climate change and global warming are only two indicators  albeit the most evident  of the situation to which I am referring. The summit on climate change proved that we are all aware of the danger we are facing. Those who underestimate and even deny that real danger will simply have to face the truth. We are already living that truth; fast  coordinated and responsible action is called for. That action must serve the interests of all  even if it may momentarily run against the interests of some  because time is running out dangerously.  We have not met yet again in the General Assembly in order to describe our world and our environment from our individual perspectives. Our mandate is not mere diagnosis. Our mandate involves healing  changing and improving. With a foreign policy based on the value of the European Union  which it will enter soon  and with its desire to develop good relations with everyone willing to reciprocate  the Republic of Croatia has shown by deeds that it is aware of the fact that there is no time to be lost. It has also shown the capacity to act and to get things going in a positive direction  both in its own interest and in that of others.  We have only one world. Its destiny is in our hands. There is room for everyone in this world  but this world can  may and must be only a world of equals  of people enjoying not only equal rights but also equal opportunities  knowing that nobody  however big and strong  can live alone and only for his own sake  and that together we can change our world. Even more importantly  however  together we can save and preserve it for future generations. But let us not forget: time is running out. "
"74",3076,"HTI",62,2007,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. There is no doubt that his deep familiarity with the academic world  tied to his experience in the political world and in business  is a major asset that will help him to lead us confidently in the Assembly’s work. I sincerely hope that our debates will be fruitful and lead to the adoption of relevant resolutions.  Allow me also to welcome our new Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who recently honoured us with his first visit to Haiti in August. We are firmly convinced that the new Secretary-General will rapidly bring to bear his experience of the United Nations system  his vast learning and his broad open-mindedness in carrying out the reforms that most Members of our Organization know to be necessary.  Despite its difficulties  our Organization remains the principal forum offering all States  large and small  the same space for dialogue to address the fundamental issues surrounding our coexistence and future on this planet. May the Secretary-General be assured of the support of the Haitians in his efforts to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations and to enable it to achieve its full potential.  I am speaking here on behalf of a people that has endured great suffering over the past 200 years: material deprivation of all sorts  vulnerability to natural threats and disasters  poor access to health care and education  the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children from malnutrition  and a very young population   65 per cent below the age of 25   denied any true opportunity for employment.  I speak on behalf of a people that seems to be depopulating itself as its most competent professionals forsake a life of difficulties to the benefit of other countries or businesses  and as its children  women and senior citizens  weary of living what seems to be a hopeless existence  take to the open seas on makeshift boats  seeking a better life under other skies.  I speak on behalf of a State whose neighbours  including the most powerful among them  sometimes portray it as a threat to regional security because Haiti appears too frequently on the agenda of the General Assembly or the Security Council  with a burdensome array of problems of insecurity or political unrest.  I speak on behalf of a country that analyses somewhat prematurely describe as a failed State because it has trouble making its institutions operational and organizing a way of life appropriate to the majority of its citizens  and because the State itself  unfortunately  often finds itself waging an endless war against its own children.  Haiti is on the way to bidding farewell to that State   slowly  patiently  yet resolutely. The organized armed gangs responsible for violence against innocent people have been dismantled and there is no longer any forbidden zone for peaceful citizens anywhere on our territory.  The management of our economy has improved considerably. We have stopped printing money. That has reduced the inflation rate   which had run rampant for several years and which just a few months ago reached 40 per cent   to less than 10 per cent. Our gross domestic product has seen moderate but sustained growth  after having been negative for more than 10 years.   We have worked patiently to establish an atmosphere of calm and collegiality within the political class  which is a condition essential for enabling the political forces to put an end to their perpetual factional disputes and to mobilize around genuine national reconstruction plans.   The Security Council will soon extend the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) for another year. Such an extension would be most appropriate. This reminds us that our victory over insecurity  the holding of democratic elections  the improvement of governance in the country and the strengthening of our judicial system were possible thanks in large part to the efforts of United Nations forces within the framework of the Organization’s peacekeeping programme. Certainly  the members of our national police  although young  inexperienced and underequipped  have proved to be courageous and determined in the fight against insecurity  but MINUSTAH’s support at their side has been greatly appreciated. Let me take this opportunity to express once again our thanks to the Organization  to the Security Council and to the friendly countries that mobilized their own resources and citizens to come to the assistance of Haitians at this difficult time in their history.  Haitians  recalling that they belong to a people who fought for their freedom and carried the torch of liberty to many other shores of the continent  continue to see the presence of foreign armed forces on their soil as a wound to their national sovereignty. Practically speaking  however  that is the only realistic formula currently available that is enabling Haitians to regain freedom and live in peace.  It is now up to Haitians to benefit from this period of calm by pulling themselves together  reconsidering their fate with a positive vision of the future and returning to daily life as a disciplined  hardworking and law-abiding people while our State strengthens its internal cohesion  modernizes its judicial system and improves its governance and its capacity to intervene  so that it can create and maintain an environment conducive to economic recovery and genuine sustainable development.  The adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was an act of awareness. Nevertheless  halfway towards the deadline set for achievement of the Goals  it seems clear that many of us   including my country   will not meet the 2015 targets  despite the considerable progress made in various areas. Mobilizing resources to support the pursuit of the MDGs is a difficult but essential task. It is not only necessary for ethical reasons or because the international community must honour its commitments. Problems that cannot be resolved in a poor State will spill over to richer States  which will thus be forced to revisit problems that they had already overcome by themselves at the national level.  The General Assembly has included in the agenda for the present session an item relating to cooperation in combating the activities of transnational organized crime. In that connection  I should like to highlight my country’s efforts to fight against corruption and illicit drug trafficking. In Haiti  we are currently developing ways to deal with corruption. We have begun to work to strengthen State structures and to plan legal and regulatory reforms to be established to ensure that that endemic evil disappears from our institutional practices  both in politics and in business.   But the fight against drug trafficking is of another scale entirely  because it sets us squarely against sophisticated and well-organized adversaries who have access to powerful international networks in both drug-producing and drug-consuming countries. We are sensitive to the human suffering and social upheaval attributable to drug abuse  and we are aware of the efforts being made to treat and rehabilitate addicts  primarily in the major drug-consuming countries. However  trafficking also has harmful effects on the economic  social and political structures of small States such as mine and poses a serious threat to their sovereignty and security  even if they are only transit States. The approach that has emerged from various international conferences focuses on prevention and demand-reduction in consumer countries first and then to reduce supply in producing countries and suppress trafficking networks.  Haiti and the Dominican Republic are on the trade route of one of the most intense flows between the producer countries of South America and the consumer countries of North America. We are firmly committed to helping the countries of the North eliminate the drugs that arrive in their countries by way of our territory as a place of transit. But we cannot deal with this scourge alone  and our efforts to improve the monitoring of our land  sea and air borders and strengthen our institutions come up against the power of the networks put in place by the traffickers.  The solutions developed to deal with these problems will clearly yield no results if we do not urgently address the issue of economic development  because  as has been eloquently stated in reports of the Secretary-General  development is another name for peace.  It follows from that observation that we need a new culture of international solidarity based on a comprehensive and coordinated approach in which the fight against poverty goes hand in hand with sustainable development. It is an approach in which development assistance and the fight against insecurity are supported by the efforts of more developed countries to open up their markets  to encourage flows of foreign direct investment and technology transfers and to support the private sector and entrepreneurial initiatives: a comprehensive approach in which rich and poor understand that they are co-owners of this planet and that its fate is in all our hands."
"75",3122,"HUN",62,2007,"Allow me first of all to warmly congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am pleased to see you  a high-ranking official from the rather underrepresented Eastern European Group  assuming that prestigious post of the United Nations. In fulfilling your challenging tasks during this session  you may be assured of the support and cooperation of the delegation of Hungary. I would also like to pay tribute to your predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa.  During the sixty-first session  Member States worked hard to come to agreement on the proposals made at the 2005 Summit meeting  but we still need to do more to ensure that the United Nations system is managed coherently and effectively. I believe that the world needs  more than ever before  effective multilateralism  which is still a key word for the future. We should make progress on management reform  mandate review and disarmament  and define further concrete steps towards a renewed Security Council.  Hungary would have preferred for the issue of Security Council reform to have seen more progress during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. The impasse was certainly not due to the lack of effort on the part of the President of the General Assembly or to a shortage of creative ideas. We believe that the best solution would still be a balanced increase of seats to better reflect the political realities of today. The enlargement process should be combined with tangible improvement of the Council’s working methods.  We welcome the adoption of the new resolution on the revitalization of the General Assembly. It is up to each Member State to make the work of the Assembly meaningful and to ensure that the Assembly takes up issues of genuine concern and takes decisions that have a real impact on the political process.  Let me now turn to Geneva  where important reforms have taken place as well. The Human Rights Council has finally started its work  in an atmosphere of high expectations. The consensus over the universal periodic review mechanism sends a clear message that all countries will have their human rights records examined at regular intervals. Thus  no country will be immune from international scrutiny. However  in order to make it truly meaningful  we have to build a credible and robust mechanism. Special procedures and contributions to the review from treaty bodies and non-governmental organizations will prove to be essential in that regard.  In order to better protect human rights and fundamental freedoms  the system of special procedures   a unique web of protection   has continued to provide effective action for the benefit of victims of human rights abuses. Special rapporteurs and independent experts have continued their work  giving a voice to the voiceless  even at times when the Council was focusing mainly on the task of institution-building.  We are thoroughly convinced that both thematic and country-specific mandates remain valid  given the numerous human rights violations still occurring on a daily basis. In that regard  we concur with the Secretary-General  who has emphasized the need to consider all situations of possible human rights violations on an equal footing. Not having a special rapporteur assigned to a particular country does not absolve that country from its obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other human rights instruments.  I should now like to share some thoughts about an issue dear to my country. We welcomed with great satisfaction the recent decision of the Human Rights Council to establish a forum on minority issues. I am confident that the forum will provide a useful platform for dialogue and exchange of views between minorities  Governments and other stakeholders on issues related to national or ethnic  linguistic and religious minorities.  Allow me to place special emphasis on the empowerment of women. We firmly believe in the need for the effective involvement of women in the decision-making processes at both the national and the international levels. In that regard  Hungary supports the ongoing debate on the future of the strengthened gender equality architecture. We welcome the steps taken towards achieving effective gender mainstreaming throughout the entire United Nations system.  On 30 March  we witnessed the signing ceremony of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. That new international instrument will improve the living conditions of almost 650 million persons with disabilities all over the world  ensuring equal opportunities for them in all aspects of life. As the second State party to ratify the Convention and its Optional Protocol  we hope that they will enter into force soon.  Seven years ago  our Governments made a remarkable promise to the world in adopting the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). Although there has certainly been some progress in achieving its objectives  there will be regions of the world where the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will not have been met by 2015 if we do not intensify our efforts. In the meantime  we must also emphasize the central role of national policies and development strategies in achieving the Goals. The sustainability of development depends heavily on national ownership and leadership. At the global level  the United Nations has a comparative advantage in providing technical assistance in the preparation and implementation of national development plans. We fully support the recommendations of the High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence to improve the operational effectiveness  inter-agency cooperation  predictability and accountability of the United Nations system.  The Millennium Development Goals represent the global commitment to fundamental rights  which must be guaranteed if we genuinely seek to strengthen our democracies. Democracy should also mean creating the conditions for sustainable economic development that provides people with access   through decent jobs   to opportunities to achieve full personal development.  We are particularly pleased that Hungary can share its transitional experiences  both as a member of the Advisory Board of the United Nations Democracy Fund and through the International Centre for Democratic Transition  which is based in Budapest and which has a partnership agreement with the Democracy Fund. The United Nations has a special responsibility to address challenges related to institution-building and to promote democracy. As Amartya Sen  the Nobel Prize winning economist has said  countries need not be fit for democracy; they need to become fit through democracy.  Hungary  as an emerging donor  is determined to meet the obligations set out in the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals. We are ready to increase our official development assistance and to carry out our efforts in line with the European Consensus on development and the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. However  we are convinced that scaling up the volume of aid in itself will not necessarily lead to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It is also important to emphasize the need for better complementarity  coordination and coherence in development cooperation.  Having been fully integrated into the European Union (EU) and NATO structures  we are committed to carrying out qualitative change in the outreach of Hungarian foreign policy. We want to make our policy and our presence more visible in all parts of the world: an active development cooperation and assistance policy coupled with an increased presence in United Nations bodies. We are resolved to attach special attention to creating more balance in the geographical scope of our cooperation policy in order to include African  Asian and Latin American countries. Stepping up our outreach efforts and developing not only assistance activities but also economic ties with Africa will mark the beginning of a new era in our relationship with that continent.  We are also ready to assume more responsibilities in various international forums. Our ambitions are best embodied in our application for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2012-2013. We view our potential membership as an opportunity to engage in constructive cooperation with all our partners in order to achieve our common objectives on the basis of shared interests and values.  Let me now focus on some of the most urgent foreign policy issues of our day.  Peace and stability in the Balkan region is of paramount importance to my country  and to Europe as a whole. While the question of the future status of Kosovo has drawn international attention  we are aware that the issue of Kosovo is a challenge that needs to be primarily tackled by Europe. Nevertheless  the United Nations has played a pivotal role in the process to date. Our hope is that that will continue to be the case until a proper solution is found.  There is no doubt that there is a significant role to be played by the EU in facilitating a satisfactory solution for Kosovo. One thing is certain among all the uncertainties: the status quo is not a solution. More than ever  the region needs stability  economic development and inter-ethnic reconciliation. The European Union has invested much in the region in terms of material  political and military assistance. It has also offered the countries of the region prospects for joining the European Union.  With regard to Serbia  we are convinced that reinforcing the prospects for future membership of the EU may facilitate finding a solution to the question of Kosovo. Hungary therefore looks forward to a successful outcome to the new round of negotiations facilitated by the EU-United States-Russia Troika  which the parties should approach in a constructive and frank manner. We hope that the encouraging signs of trust and a constructive approach will prevail in the course of the entire process  and that the parties will be able to come to an agreement endorsed by the Security Council. We are following with great attention the work of the teams set up recently by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to negotiate core issues related to a permanent solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We welcome the initiative of the President of the United States to convene an international conference in November.  Hungary is firmly committed to the reconstruction of Afghanistan. As a State member of the North Atlantic alliance  we have been involved in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force since 2003. On 1 October 2006  we took over the leadership of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Baghlan province. I am proud of the successful work done by Hungary’s military contingent and by Hungarian teams of aid workers. Moreover  I can confirm our future commitment in Afghanistan  which enjoys broad political consensus among all the parties represented in the Hungarian parliament. Nevertheless  we must not forget that the primary responsibility for the stabilization and development of Afghanistan lies with the Afghan people themselves. We are concerned about the security situation and the attacks carried out by Taliban and anti-Government forces  and we firmly condemn all hostage-taking actions. Drug production and trafficking continue to be a major source of instability  and we note the increase in opium production with grave concern. We encourage the Afghan Government  working in close cooperation with the international community and in particular with its regional partners  to take effective measures to stabilize the whole region.  The stabilization of Iraq is one of the major challenges in the Middle East. We appreciate the results that have been achieved so far in the course of the country’s democratic transformation. However  the Iraqi political class needs to overcome the present state of deep division and start to walk down the path of reconciliation and cooperation in order to bring peace and stability to the country. As a precondition for a long-lasting settlement of the conflict  the international community must enable Iraqi leaders to assume ownership and govern their country in an independent way.  Hungary is very concerned about the acts of violence perpetrated by the security forces of the Burma/Myanmar Government. We are committed to respecting human rights and democracy  and we therefore strongly condemn the brutal physical attacks against peaceful demonstrators. I reiterate our previous call on the Government of Burma/Myanmar to fully respect human rights and the norms of democracy  in particular the rights to peaceful assembly and to the free expression of opinions.  Due to one of the most worrisome conflicts on the African continent   the one raging in Darfur   the situation in the Sudan and nearby countries is still unpredictable and explosive. Hungary welcomes the renewed momentum in the efforts to resolve the Darfur conflict  in particular the agreement reached on the deployment of the African Union-United Nations hybrid force and the subsequent adoption of Security Council resolution 1769 (2007). We consider it essential that the Hybrid Operation be launched  and that troops be fully deployed in the full number authorized  as soon as possible. I would like to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on having made resolving the Darfur conflict a priority  as well as on his visit to the Sudan. It is in that context that I reaffirm our support for the peacebuilding and peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations.  Hungary welcomes the fact that the Peacebuilding Commission has started its work and has met in a country-specific format to consider the cases of Burundi and Sierra Leone. We look forward to the first report on its work. We consider the Commission to be an important instrument to enhance the capabilities of the United Nations to support countries emerging from conflict.  We are fully aware of the need to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to mount and sustain complex and multidimensional peacekeeping operations. Hungary commends the efforts made by the Secretary-General to achieve that purpose and welcomes the General Assembly’s decision to establish the Department of Field Support. My country’s track record in the field of peacekeeping demonstrates that we are willing to actively support the Security Council’s decisions. Hungarian military and police personnel are present in many of the peacekeeping missions of the United Nations  namely  in Cyprus  Georgia  Kosovo  Lebanon and Western Sahara.  My recent participation at the fifty-first General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and my talks with Director General Mohamed ElBaradei reaffirmed my conviction that questions relating to nuclear safety and non-proliferation should remain high on our agenda.  Hungary shares the concerns of the international community over Iran’s nuclear programme. We deplore Iran’s failure to take the steps required by the IAEA Board of Governors and by Security Council resolutions  steps necessary to re-establish international confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. We welcomed the adoption of Security Council resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1747 (2007)  and we fully comply with the obligations set forth therein. We hope that Iran will soon realize that a diplomatic and negotiated solution is possible and that compliance has many benefits.  Hungary continues to support the process aimed at achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful manner and welcomes the first promising results of the Six-Party Talks. Developments related to the North Korean nuclear issue have underscored the importance of the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.  Hungary supports all multilateral  regional and bilateral efforts that contribute in an effective manner to our common goal of achieving disarmament and curbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Such efforts must also aim at upholding and strengthening key international treaties and export control regimes. In that context  one of the most important challenges is to ensure compliance with the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Moreover  Hungary welcomes the entry into force of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism  which we ratified in April.  An urgent issue in the field of counter-terrorism is the full and earliest possible implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. In that regard  the main responsibility lies with Member States  which should all also actively participate in the upcoming implementation review. The conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism remains another high priority for Hungary.  Fifteen years after the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  the Rio Summit  it is evident that  at the current pace  our efforts will not be sufficient to halt the emerging global threats  in particular that of climate change. The European Union has a clear position in that regard  and it has proposed to speed up the drafting of a new global compact. As a member of the EU  Hungary fully agrees with the urgency of the matter. We hope that the ongoing deliberations on the future of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and of the Kyoto Protocol will lead to concrete results within two years. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the efforts made by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to raise awareness about climate change in the international community.  On behalf of my country  I would like to reiterate Hungary’s commitment to upholding the rule of international law  to giving priority to effective multilateralism  to spreading the culture of cooperation and the peaceful settlement of international disputes  and to making every effort to preserve a sustainable environment for future generations.  In conclusion  Hungary is strongly committed to working with you  Mr. President  during the sixty-second session of the General Assembly to achieve the objectives set out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome. "
"76",3169,"IDN",62,2007,"Let me begin by stating how much I welcome and support the theme of this year’s sixty-second session of the General Assembly  which is “Responding to climate change”.  I stand here representing the good people of Indonesia  who are very eager to welcome representatives to the Bali conference in December this year. When they come to our country  they will see a great nation whose multi-ethnic and multi-religious people live in harmony with one another and in harmony with mother Earth  the way they have for thousands of years.  Indonesia is a country that has felt and suffered the effects of climate change. In recent years  we have been hit by a series of natural disasters in the form of floods  drought  forest fires  El Niño  tsunamis and earthquakes. The issue of climate change has made us see interdependence in a completely new light. When it comes to global warming  we are much more interdependent than we thought in terms of the causes  symptoms and solutions.  We must uphold the principle of common and differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities  but there is always room for every country  every community and every individual to be more flexible  more innovative and more inclusive.  A persistent theme in our discussions on climate change yesterday was the need for urgency  which means the need for action and the need to think outside the box. I count myself as an optimist who sees today a larger window of opportunity to strike a global consensus to tackle global warming.  We will have that chance in Bali. The Bali conference must yield a new road map on climate change  and that new road map must spell out what must be done by both the developed and the developing worlds to save humankind and its planet from the looming tragedy of climate change. It must link the solution to the problem of climate change with sustainable development   the conquest of poverty. It must produce an outcome and timeline that will be more comprehensive and more ambitious in achieving its practical objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  We developing countries must protect our natural resources while using them wisely for development. Among the most valuable of our natural resources are our forests. From them  we extract economic wealth; through them  we store an immense volume of carbon that would otherwise pollute the atmosphere.  On that basis  yesterday Indonesia took the initiative of launching a special leaders’ meeting of tropical rainforest countries. At that meeting  we leaders of the countries having custody of a great portion of the world’s rainforests decided to intensify our cooperation in forest conservation and reforestation.  We also believe that countries that seek to enhance their carbon sinks   through forestation  afforestation and avoided deforestation   should be given incentives and rewarded fairly for doing so.  Throughout our deliberations on climate change  let us always keep an eye on the requirements of development. That means we must not lose sight of the imperative to conquer poverty as a basic problem of the human condition.   In Indonesia we have a national dream  which is reflected in our 1945 Constitution. We dream that we and our future generations can enjoy the blessings of peace  freedom  justice and prosperity. And we dream of seeing to it that the same blessings are enjoyed by the rest of humankind. Poverty can kill that dream.   That is why the new Indonesia of today is fully dedicated to the fight against poverty. For that purpose  our national economic policy is focused on the development of rural areas  where the vast majority of our people live and where they wage a daily struggle against the ravages of poverty. That is why we are so intent on making the national business climate friendly and attractive to foreign direct investment  so that jobs will be created for our millions of unemployed people. That is why we are so intent on eradicating the taint of corruption from our society. And that is why our foreign policy addresses the need for a truly functioning global partnership for development  because only such a partnership can ultimately conquer the basic problem of poverty.  Peace in the Middle East is crucial to long-term global stability. But there can be no peace in the Middle East unless there is justice  especially justice for the Palestinian people. A divided Palestinian nation cannot secure justice. Hamas and Fatah must therefore engage in dialogue and reconcile their agendas. The Arab initiative must catalyse political change in the region.  Indonesia has a long history of participating in United Nations peacekeeping operations that dates back to the Suez conflict  in 1956. We are taking part in the operation in Lebanon today. We are determined to maintain that proud tradition of involvement in global concerns. That  I believe  is what humankind needs most today  namely  the involvement of everyone. There must be a global partnership at work. Developed and developing countries must work together with a greater sense of partnership and of urgency.  Therefore  to solve the problem of climate change the Bali Conference must set the stage for a genuine partnership between developed and developing countries and all other stakeholders. Developed countries must extend support while developing countries strive to protect and enhance their environment and its biodiversity. They must lighten the burden of developing countries in carrying out that immense task   through incentives and the transfer of environmentally sound technology.  While developing countries are in hot pursuit of their Millennium Development Goals  the developed world can greatly help ensure the success of the Doha Development Round. Developed countries must ensure sufficient flows of financing for development through foreign direct investment and official development assistance. They must facilitate the transfer of technology for development.  We in the developing world  on the other hand  must prudently manage our natural and human resources. We must practise good governance. We must fight corruption at all levels so that our resources will not be wasted. We must see to it that the human rights of our citizens are promoted and protected.  No partnership works without teamwork  and no teamwork is possible without constant effective communication. That means dialogue. After all  dialogue is the best way to exercise soft power. Dialogue and soft power can greatly advance the cause of disarmament and non-proliferation. Dialogue and soft power have helped resolve various intra-State conflicts   including in Aceh  where two years ago we reached a peaceful political settlement that permanently ended the conflict. Dialogue and soft power can also be a major instrument in addressing the root causes of terrorism.   That is why I am a firm advocate of dialogue among faiths  cultures and civilizations. I urge that the dialogue in the Alliance of Civilizations be fully integrated into the work of the United Nations. Sincere dialogue can lead to the formation of an effective global partnership on climate change  which is also a partnership for sustainable development. I look forward to such a dialogue taking place at the Bali Conference this coming December. That will be a vitally important dialogue  for it can set off a chain of events that will lead to the fulfilment of the dream of billions for a safer  better life. It will certainly add sheen to the national dream of Indonesia   our common dream   for a better world of peace  social justice and equitably shared prosperity. "
"77",3216,"IND",62,2007,"Kindly accept my congratulations  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. My delegation assures you of its full cooperation as we address issues identified in the annual report of the Secretary-General (A/62/1) and as we responsibly and creatively move forward with pending reforms of the Organization.  At the outset I would like to express India’s deep gratitude to all Member States for the recent unanimous adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 61/271  deciding to annually observe the International Day of Non-Violence  on 2 October  the anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi. I also look forward to participation by Member States in the informal plenary meeting of the General Assembly and other functions being organized tomorrow at the United Nations to mark the first International Day of Non-Violence. A central topic for this year’s debate   responding to climate change   is both timely and relevant. India’s views on it were recently set forth at the high-level event on climate change  which took place here on 24 September. Combined with the exchange of views in the general debate  it will no doubt provide a useful backdrop to the meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held later this year in Bali  Indonesia.   The impact of climate change and environmental degradation falls disproportionately upon developing countries. Developing countries are the most vulnerable to it  and also lack the means to tackle it. Measures to address climate change must be based on mitigation and adaptation strategies with fair burden-sharing and measures to realize sustainable patterns of consumption and production. The process of burden-sharing must also take into account where the primary responsibility for the present state of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere rests and not foreclose rapid and sustained economic development for the developing world  which  in any case  is an imperative for adaptation.  Technology is the other key area that needs to be addressed. It is important that critical clean technologies be made available and affordable to developing countries. The intellectual property rights regime must balance rewards for innovators with the common good of humankind. Concerted international action to address climate change  in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities  as well as national circumstances and social and economic conditions  is the need of the hour. India  for which energy security is a national imperative  has a very small individual carbon footprint  with per capita carbon dioxide emissions at just about a quarter of the world’s average. Even so  we are determined that  as we pursue economic growth  our per capita greenhouse gas emissions will not increase beyond those of the industrial countries.  Poverty and underdevelopment are amongst the central challenges of our times. The overarching requirement is for sustained economic growth to eradicate poverty in developing countries. However  economic growth must also be measured against the template of social inclusion. Growth alone is not enough if it does not produce benefits that are sufficiently dispersed  not only in terms of increased income and employment  but also for improved health  nutrition and education for all.  I affirm India’s resolve to achieve the internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals. The Government of India accords the highest priority to inclusive growth  including the political  legal  educational and economic empowerment of women  effective and affordable public health  and enhanced access to educational opportunities  especially for all those who are disadvantaged.  It is apparent that progress in the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals has been tardy. The international community  through the United Nations system  must more effectively support the efforts of developing countries to achieve the development goals. A comprehensive reform of the international financial architecture is a key ingredient in that process. The United Nations must play an important role in overseeing the reform of the international financial architecture. That should include measures to ensure a greater voice for and participation by developing countries in the Bretton Woods institutions. The process of reform must be carried to its logical conclusion if the credibility of those institutions is to be enhanced.  We must also address as a priority the regrettable inversion of global resource flows. Today  instead of the urgently needed inflow of resources to developing countries to buttress their national economic development plans  we are confronted with a net outflow from them. Official development assistance (ODA) showed a marked fall during 2006 and remains well below the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product. It is primarily being used to finance debt relief. That this is happening after so many years of liberalization and globalization highlights our collective failure. Perhaps we should be considering mechanisms  such as an international debt commission  to redress the problem of developing country debt.   The least developed countries  which are particularly hard hit by rising energy costs  find themselves in an even more difficult situation. Enhanced and predictable resource flow to developing countries remains a key objective of the global partnership for development. India will continue to do what it can to help with capacity-building in other developing countries and to assist them through ODA within the limits of its capacity. By the end of the year  imports from least developed countries into India will face a zero-tariff regime.  Early and substantive progress at the Doha Round of trade negotiations  based on the primacy of the development dimension  is another imperative. We must return to the negotiating table with a redoubled sense of urgency  while recognizing that adherence to the existing mandate remains critical. Nor can the interests of subsistence farmers be ignored or equated with those of other sectors. An illogical linkage between agriculture and non-agricultural market access will only complicate the development impact of the Round. The overarching principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries remains a categorical imperative.  As part of India's commitment to the achievement of human rights for all  and as a member of the Human Rights Council  we remain actively involved in developing the institutional framework of that body  including the universal periodic review mechanism  based on effective international cooperation as a central principle in the Council’s methods of work. India will work towards developing an international normative framework for the promotion and protection of human rights. India is honoured to be one of the first signatories of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Earlier today  I also had the honour of depositing India’s instrument of ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.   As the largest democracy in the world  India has developed a system of local self-government with democratically elected institutions of representative Government at all levels   the village  the district  the State and the nation. The effort to make participatory democracy more meaningful to every Indian citizen underpins what is perhaps one of the greatest social experiments in the world today  namely  the transfer of decision-making power to nearly one million elected women local Government representatives. As a result  women are not merely the beneficiaries of change in India  but are its instruments.  As the world’s largest democracy  it was also natural for India to support the establishment of the United Nations Democracy Fund. We made an initial contribution of $10 million to the Fund and remain actively and constructively involved in realizing the objectives for which it was set up. As a small token of our commitment to that laudable initiative  I have the privilege of announcing a further pledge of $10 million to the United Nations Democracy Fund.  The international system cannot be reordered meaningfully without a comprehensive reform of the United Nations. If the Organization is to remain the cornerstone of the international architecture in this century  it cannot remain mired in the realities of the 1940s. Despite substantive implementation of the United Nations reform agenda that emerged from the 2005 World Summit Outcome  such reform will inevitably remain incomplete without comprehensive reform and expansion of the Security Council and revitalization of the General Assembly. Elements and ideas on the reform of the Security Council have been discussed for well over a decade in numerous reports and interminable consultations. It is now time for intergovernmental negotiations to commence in order to make the Security Council more democratic  representative and responsive.   We  together with partners from Africa  Latin America and Asia  tabled a resolution on 11 September 2007  spelling out the principles on which reform ought to be based if it is to be meaningful. These principles are expansion in both permanent and non-permanent categories of membership; greater representation for developing countries and representation for developed countries that is reflective of contemporary world realities; and comprehensive improvement in the working methods of the Security Council  including ensuring greater access for island and small States. We welcome recent statements from this podium by President Bush of the United States of America and other world leaders on the need for Security Council reform in both the permanent and non-permanent categories. It is high time that we collectively bring these ideas to implementation.  Reform of the United Nations would also be incomplete without revitalization of the General Assembly. The central goal of such revitalization must be the restoration and enhancement of the role and authority of the General Assembly as originally envisaged in the Charter.  Given the significance of developmental activities for the developing world  India sees a corresponding need for the reform of United Nations operational activities in favour of development. Since these activities are aimed at supporting the work of Member States  it follows that Members must determine their direction and shape through an intergovernmental process. The litmus test for any reform proposal is whether it improves the support extended by the United Nations to the efforts of programme countries. India would therefore judge reform proposals by their impact on the ground  by the resultant improvement in the effectiveness of the system and by the impact on transaction costs for the United Nations development system.  Steps to achieve the complete elimination of nuclear weapons have also only made limited headway. Despite some progress  the world remains far from achieving the objective of total elimination of nuclear weapons. India’s long-standing commitment to universal  non-discriminatory and comprehensive nuclear disarmament is embodied in the vision of late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for a nuclear-free and non-violent world. This vision was put forward nearly two decades ago. It remains undiminished today.   Indeed  it is all the more relevant today  given the fact that peaceful uses of nuclear energy can address the inexorably growing demand for new and  non-polluting sources of energy to fuel economic development. We will be bringing proposals to Member States and this Organization to see how we can refocus on general and complete disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament. Disarmament is our agreed goal  and it subsumes arms control and non-proliferation.  It is well known that India has an impeccable record in preventing the proliferation of sensitive technologies. That is in keeping with our commitment to being a responsible nuclear Power. India is ready to work with the international community to develop a new international consensus on non-proliferation. The international community needs to intensify the effort to address the very real threat posed by the link between the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and related materials and technologies and the ability of non-State actors to acquire them. The risk posed by the intersection between proliferation and terrorism is real and serious. The central objective must be to ensure that our solidarity in words is translated into action.  The adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy last September was a noteworthy development  signalling the will of the international community to combat this menace in a holistic and coordinated manner. Welcome as the Strategy is  there is much more that needs to be done to combat the menace that international terrorism has become. India is convinced that without the early adoption of a comprehensive convention against international terrorism  the global struggle against terrorism remains incomplete and likely to succeed only partially. We must ensure that there is zero tolerance for all forms of terrorism.  In conclusion  I would express the hope that our deliberations in the year ahead will lead us to enlightened action. With maturity and resolve we will successfully overcome the many challenges before us. "
"78",3262,"IRL",62,2007,"First of all  Mr. President  may I congratulate you on your election and wish you well in the months ahead.  Upon its formation earlier this year  the Irish Government set itself the goal of becoming a model Member State of the this great Organization. We have set out an ambitious programme to be a world leader in development assistance  rapid response to humanitarian disasters and conflict resolution.  This is because our own history shows that there is a path from famine to plenty and from conflict to peace. And from that history has grown a determination  in ordinary Irish men and women  to stand in the vanguard of the fight against conflict  hunger and the denial of human rights  a fight best fought by a strong and equally determined United Nations   a fight we cannot afford to lose.  It is also because after six decades  the core goal of the United Nations   universal peace and security   unfortunately still eludes us. Today  in spite of all our efforts  violent conflict remains all too common.  The causes of conflict are many. But very often  it is in the persistence of poverty and in the denial of human rights that we find the causes of conflict  the enduring results of conflict and the seeds of future conflict. In making peace  we must be as creative and as determined as those waging war.  The range of instruments now available strengthens our collective capacity to resolve conflict. We must use that full array with determination now. We must ensure that the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission and Peacebuilding Fund are organized and resourced to fulfil their important mandate. We must maintain our support for United Nations-mandated peacekeeping operations  which today are at an all-time high in terms of their size  scope and complexity. We must also support strengthened United Nations efforts in the fields of conflict prevention and resolution. We in Ireland will play our part.  My Government has decided to significantly increase its commitment to conflict resolution  including through the establishment of a designated unit in the Foreign Ministry  the creation of an academic Centre for Conflict Resolution  a system of roving ambassadors to affected regions and an annual fund of €25 million to assist conflict resolution in the developing world.  In the years ahead  we will also work to strengthen the capacity of the African Union and subregional organizations to make and build peace for themselves. We will focus our efforts on peacemaking during conflict and peacebuilding after conflict. We will also work on identifying  distilling and sharing the lessons of conflict resolution. We will be particularly active in Africa  including through working with our partner Governments under our Irish Aid programme. We will explore the links between climate change and conflict  because climate change directly threatens not only the most vulnerable but all of our shared goals of progress  peace and development.  The focus of our foreign policy on rights  development and now conflict resolution underlines once again Ireland’s commitment to the global agenda of the United Nations. But this convergence is also underscored by our own national experience of peacemaking. Speaking here in New York in April 1969  before the appalling escalation of violence in Northern Ireland  one of my distinguished predecessors  Frank Aiken  said “I think there is sufficient wisdom if it can only be energized in our section of the world  in these islands off the North West of Europe  to settle the problem.” For far too long that sufficient wisdom eluded us.  For almost 40 years it has been my duty and that of my predecessors as Minister for Foreign Affairs to brief this Assembly on the search for peace on the island of Ireland. I am particularly delighted to report that perhaps  save for general updates on progress  this will no longer be necessary.  The conflict in Northern Ireland lasted for more than three decades and was made apparently insoluble by issues of national  cultural and religious identity  contested historical narratives and claims of sovereignty  all hardened by the direct experiences of division  inequality and violence.  Since the ceasefires of the mid-1990s and the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998  there has been much better news to report. But the final steps to the full implementation of that Agreement were not completed until earlier this year. With the formation of the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive  bringing together historic opponents from across the political divide  we have opened an extraordinary new chapter in the history of the island of Ireland.  Legacies of separation and distrust remain  and the inevitable challenges and difficulties of normal politics will need wise and sensitive management. But there is an overwhelming consensus that this new beginning can be nurtured and sustained.  The task is no longer to find peace  but to maintain and build on the peace we have found. I do not believe our success offers a universal  transferable formula  but I do believe that our experience of failure and then success over 40 years provides insights and lessons worth sharing. One of the specific tasks of our conflict resolution initiative is to codify those insights and lessons. But today I will offer just a few.  First  in the end  those who are part of the problem must be part of the solution   not because we approve of their actions or beliefs  but because without them it is all too easy for an agreement among others to be destroyed.  Secondly  inclusive dialogue must  however  take place on the basis of clear and guaranteed principles. In Ireland  these were consent  non-violence and parity of esteem.  Thirdly  partnerships between Governments and involving sympathetic third parties   in our case the United States and the European Union   can develop comprehensive frameworks within which enduring settlements can be reached.  Fourthly  it is often necessary to take risks for peace   but those risks must be carefully calibrated. Timing is of the essence and so is patience  and there are times when contacts must be private and at arm’s length.  Fifthly  our experience demonstrates the need to address all issues  all of the causes of conflict  comprehensively  no matter how difficult and intractable they may be  and even if they have to be resolved in different time frames.  Sixth  popular endorsement of an agreement through the ballot box makes it immensely more legitimate and durable.  Finally  without effective and faithful implementation  again often with external assistance  an agreement’s viability and credibility can quickly ebb away.  On a more practical and operational level  we have devised and implemented innovative arrangements for dealing with many of the issues that dominate peacemaking and peacebuilding in our case: constitutional change  power sharing  cross-border cooperation  transitional justice  policing and security reform  equality and human rights  conflict over symbols  arms decommissioning and prisoner release.  In our own process  we have learned much from others  particularly from the instance of South Africa. Together  I hope we can  in Frank Aiken’s term  develop both sufficient wisdom and sufficient will to resolve enduring and complex conflicts.  Working with a strengthened United Nations and sharing lessons with one another  I passionately hope we can advance the day when political leaders from other regions of the world blighted by conflict can announce in this forum that peace has come to them too.  Northern Ireland has been added to the list of conflicts resolved. But the road to universal peace is still blocked by conflicts old  new and threatened.  Today  across the world we stand with the people of Burma. The courage of the Buddhist monks and nuns and their supporters has won universal admiration. The efforts of its regime to conceal its brutality behind a wall of silence have failed. It has been rightly condemned for its violent response. I call on its leaders at long last to respond constructively to the wishes of the people  to stop their violence and to release Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners. The process of national reconciliation and democratization must begin in earnest  and we hope that the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy will be able to report progress on his return here in a few days.  We look to the Security Council to respond effectively to the compelling calls of the international community. It is neither acceptable nor true to argue  as some of its members have  that the situation in Burma is not a question of international peace and security. The potential regional consequences of the crisis are evident to all. This places a particular onus on the Governments of China  India and of the countries of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). I welcome the encouraging recent signs of positive and concerned engagement and urge them to redouble their efforts.  Within the European Union  Ireland has long taken a strong and principled position on Burma. We are looking urgently at how to increase the pressure on the regime  including through further European Union restrictive measures  without harming the ordinary people  whose suffering is already so great.  As it is for people across the world  Darfur is a matter of grave concern in Ireland. We have made it a priority for our diplomacy and our Irish Aid programme. We must solve the humanitarian and security crisis while simultaneously establishing the foundations for longer-term peace and development. We urge the full  effective and speedy deployment of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. Khartoum must actively cooperate and at last desist from all obstruction. Rebel groups must also play their part. The recent attack on peacekeepers in Darfur was an outrage and was rightly condemned here. I would like to express my sympathies and those of the Irish Government to the families of those killed.  In keeping with our proud tradition of peacekeeping  Ireland expects to make a substantial contribution to the United Nations-mandated mission to Chad and the Central African Republic to help aid refugees and address the regional dimension of the Darfur crisis.  All those who are party to the conflict must commit to the political talks in Libya next month. I welcome the Secretary-General’s establishment of a trust fund to support these talks  and I pledge Ireland’s support in that respect. If commitments are not fulfilled and progress does not materialize  Ireland will support further sanctions against non-cooperating parties.  I am particularly and gravely concerned at the increasingly serious humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. The current Southern African Development Community initiative  led by President Mbeki  offers the best hope for progress and I would encourage all those involved to redouble their efforts to agree on a new political dispensation offering real political reform and economic recovery for all Zimbabweans.  The situation in the Middle East is always high on our agenda. There has been a collective international failure to establish a credible political process leading to a two-State solution. But today there are possibilities for change. The outlines of a viable settlement are clear to everyone  even if it will require difficult and painful compromises. Ireland strongly supports the dialogue between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas. We are also encouraged by the determination of the Arab States to pursue the historic Arab Peace Initiative. We share the hope that the international meeting now in preparation under Secretary Rice’s leadership will indeed be serious and substantive and set in train a transformation of the political landscape and the lives of its people.  Ireland’s historic commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation continues. We are also active in seeking a comprehensive response to the curse of cluster munitions  the appalling effects of which are all too evident in Lebanon and elsewhere. As a contribution to the collaborative effort launched in Oslo last February  Ireland will host a diplomatic conference in May 2008  which we hope will finalize the first-ever international agreement on cluster munitions.  The establishment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) spurred our efforts to tackle poverty and its consequences. I greatly welcome the Secretary-General’s establishment of the MDG Africa Steering Group to lead a determined push to achieve our targets for 2015.  Ireland is doing its part. We are currently spending more than 0.5 per cent of our gross national product on overseas development aid and will reach 0.7 per cent by 2012. We have substantially increased our support to humanitarian relief operations and to tackling HIV/AIDS. But we know that more needs to be done. The donor community is failing the test set by the MDGs. Overseas aid has fallen by 5 per cent in real terms. It is not acceptable in today’s world that there are still 980 million people living in abject poverty  that half of the developing world has no access to basic sanitation or that half a million women will die in pregnancy or childbirth each year. Perhaps the most damning fact is that one in seven people on this Earth today do not get enough food to eat to have a healthy and productive life. That figure jumps to one in four in sub-Saharan Africa.  To help meet that most basic of challenges  Ireland has established a Hunger Task Force to examine the root causes of that enduring source of misery  disease and death. It will help us contribute to the MDG goal of halving hunger and poverty. I am delighted that the experts on the Hunger Task Force include Jeffrey Sachs  the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the MDGs.  Ireland will maintain and increase its commitment to the work of the United Nations in the fields of peace and security  development and human rights. There is no mystery to the challenges facing us  even if they are formidable. Our generation is uniquely equipped to know what it will take to deal with them. We have the scientific knowledge  the experience  the resources and  through this Organization  the mechanism for cooperation to rise to these challenges. We must summon sufficient wisdom and will to do so. "
"79",3309,"IRN",62,2007,"I am pleased and  grateful to the Almighty to have the opportunity once again to attend this important universal forum.  In the present tumultuous world  loud outcries  threats and tensions predominate. The big Powers are unable to solve present problems  and mistrust in regional and international arenas is on the rise. The psychological security of societies is targeted by an onslaught of political and propaganda designs; disappointment prevails with regard to the efficacy of the policies and actions of the international organizations in the establishment of durable peace and security  and the protection of human rights is being weakened. I plan to touch upon and explain the roots of and solutions to these predicaments and some of the principal challenges facing our world. I will also speak to you about the need to remedy the present situation  about prospects for a brighter and a more hopeful future and about the appearance of the sublime  about beauty  compassion and generosity  about justice and the blossoming of all God-given human talents and about the prominence of faith in God and the realization of the promise of God. I will then submit for your judgement the question of Iran’s nuclear programme as a yardstick for the measurement of honesty  efficacy  steadfastness and accomplishment. In the closing part of my statement  I will offer my proposals.  As you are all aware  mankind is currently facing important  numerous and diverse challenges. I will refer to some of them.  First  organized attempts to destroy the institution of family and to weaken the status of women. Family is the most sacred and valuable human institution. It is the centre of the purest mutual love and affection between mothers  fathers and children  provides a safe environment for the nurturing of human generations and serves as a fertile ground for the blossoming of talent and compassion. This institution has been respected in all times by all peoples  religions and cultures. Today we are witnessing an organized attack by the enemies and plunderers of humanity  who are trying to destroy this noble institution by promoting lewdness and violence and by crossing the boundaries of chastity and decency.  Womanhood  as the manifestation of divine beauty and supreme kindness  affection and purity  has been heavily exploited in recent decades by the holders of power and the owners of media and wealth. In some societies  womanhood has been reduced to a mere instrument of publicity  and all the boundaries and protective shields of chastity  purity and beauty have been trampled. That is a colossal betrayal of human society and of future generations  and it is an irreparable blow to the pillar of social coherence  the family.  I now turn to the issues of widespread violations of human rights  terrorism and occupation. Unfortunately  human rights are being extensively violated by certain Powers   especially those who pretend to be their exclusive advocates. Setting up secret prisons  abducting persons  carrying out trials and secret punishments without any regard for due process  conducting extensive tapping of telephone conversations  intercepting private mail and issuing frequent summonses to appear at police and security centres have become commonplace and prevalent. These Powers prosecute scientists and historians for stating their opinions on important global issues.  They use various pretexts to occupy sovereign States and cause insecurity and division  and then use the prevailing situation as an excuse to continue their occupation. For more than 60 years  Palestine  as compensation for the loss that it incurred during the war in Europe  has been under the occupation of the illegal Zionist regime. The Palestinian people have been displaced  are under heavy military pressure or economic siege or are incarcerated under abhorrent conditions. The occupiers are protected and praised  while the innocent Palestinians are subjected to political  military and propaganda onslaughts. The people of Palestine are deprived of water  electricity and medicine for the sin of asking for freedom  and the Government that was freely elected by the people is targeted. Terrorists are being organized to attack the lives and property of people with the blessings of the politicians and military officials of the great Powers.  The brutal Zionists carry out targeted assassinations of Palestinians in their homes and cities  and terrorists are decorated with medals of peace and receive support from the great Powers. On the other hand  they attract a number of Jews from various parts of the world by using false propaganda and by promising to provide them with welfare  jobs and food  and then settle them in the occupied territories  exposing them to the harshest restrictions  psychological pressures and constant threats. They prevent these people from returning to their homelands and  by coercion and propaganda  incite them to malevolence towards the indigenous Palestinian people.  Iraq was occupied under the pretext of overthrowing a dictator and the existence of weapons of mass destruction. The Iraqi dictator  who had been supported by the same occupiers  was disposed of  and no weapons of mass destruction were discovered  but the occupation continues under different pretexts. No day passes by without people being killed  wounded or displaced  and the occupiers not only refuse to be accountable for and ashamed of their military adventure  but speak in a report of a new market for their armaments as a result of it. They even oppose the Constitution  the National Assembly and the Government established by the vote of the people  while not even having the courage to declare their defeat and to leave Iraq.  Unfortunately  we are witnessing the bitter truth that some Powers do not value any nation or human being and that the only things that matter to them are themselves and their political parties and groups. In their view  human rights amount to profits for their companies and their friends. The rights and the dignity of American people are also being sacrificed for the selfish desires of those holding power.  I shall now discuss aggressions against indigenous cultures and national values. Culture is the manifestation of identity  the key to the survival of nations and the foundation for their interaction with others. In an organized movement  indigenous cultures that are messengers of monotheism  love and fraternity are being subjected to broad and destructive aggressions. National customs and values are being humiliated  and the self-esteem and character of nations are being ridiculed and defamed. The purpose is to promote blind emulation  consumerism  scepticism towards God and human values and the plundering of the peoples’ wealth by great Powers.  With regard to poverty  illiteracy  health-care issues and the gap between the rich and the poor  I should like to say that  while a major part of the natural environment in Asia  Africa and Latin America is being plundered by the political and economic domination of certain Powers  the situation of poverty and deprivation is alarming.   Let me draw the attention of the Assembly to some data issued by the United Nations. Every day  nearly 800 million people go to bed hungry and about 980 million suffer from absolute poverty  having less than a dollar a day in purchasing power. People in 31 countries   equivalent to 9 per cent of the world’s population   have an average life expectancy of 46 years  which is 32 years fewer than the average in developed countries. The gap between the rich and the poor in some parts of the world has increased by 40 times. In many countries  the majority of the people are deprived of access to education and schooling. In developing countries  the rate of maternal mortality during pregnancy is 450 per 100 000; that figure is 7 in the richer nations. The infant mortality rate is 59 per 1 000 live births for the developing countries and 6 for the richer nations. One third of the deaths throughout the world   or 50 000 deaths daily   result from poverty. I believe that those data clearly demonstrate the tragic situation dominating economic interactions in the world.  Next  I shall take up the forsaking of noble values and the promotion of deception and lies. Some Powers sacrifice all human values  including honesty  purity and trust  for the advancement of their goals. They propagate scepticism and deception in the relations between States and peoples. They lie openly  level baseless charges against others  act in contradiction to legal norms and damage the atmosphere of trust and friendship. In their relations with others  they openly abandon morality and noble values  forsaking justice  respect for others  love  affection and honesty for selfishness  supremacy  enmity and imposition. They sacrifice all the good things of life  including the sublime  for their own greed.  I now turn to violations of rules of international law and disrespect for commitments. Some  who themselves have drafted international law  openly and easily violate it and apply discriminatory policies and double standards to others. Having drafted disarmament regulations  they daily test and stockpile new generations of lethal weapons. Having helped to frame the Charter of the United Nations  they show disrespect for the right of sovereign nations to self-determination and independence. They conveniently abrogate their formal treaties and do not yield to laws concerning protection of the environment. Most of the violations of international obligations are committed by a few global Powers.  I will now talk about an escalation of threats and the arms race. Some Powers  whenever their logic fails  simply use the language of threats. The huge arms race casts its menacing shadow over the entire globe. The nations of Europe were the victims of two world wars and a number of other devastating conflicts and were subjected to the consequences of the cold war for many decades. Today  Europeans are living under threat and their interests  security and lands are endangered because of the arms race carried on by certain big Powers.  A bullying Power arrogates to itself the right to set up a missile system  poisons the life of the peoples of a continent and lays the ground for an arms race. Some rulers who superficially appear to be powerful actually believe that the tools they have at hand can be used at any time and for any purpose and  consequently  threaten others and cast the shadow of insecurity over nations and regions.  International organizations and mechanisms clearly lack the capacity to overcome problems and challenges  to put in place fair and just relations and peace  fraternity and security. There is hardly a Government or nation that really trusts these mechanisms to secure its rights or defend its independence  territorial integrity and national interests.  There are many more challenges besides the ones I have enumerated. I know that I could have introduced more had I wanted to touch upon them  but I chose to confine myself to the ones I have stated. Now  the important and decisive question concerns the roots and causes of these challenges. A scientific and careful analysis shows that two fundamental factors account for the present situation. Without a doubt  the first factor is the relations arising from the consequences of the Second World War. The victors of the war drew the road map for global domination and formulated their policies on the basis not of justice but of safeguarding the interests of the victors over the vanquished nations. Therefore  for 60 years now  mechanisms arising from this approach and related policies have been incapable of finding just solutions for global problems. Some big Powers still behave like the victors of the World War and regard other States and nations  even those that had nothing to do with the war  as the vanquished. They humiliate other nations and make extortionate demands. Their condescending ways are reminiscent of medieval times and the old lord-serf relationship. They believe that they should have more rights than others and that they are not accountable to any international organization.  Unfortunately  among all the ineffective bodies  the United Nations Security Council ranks first; owing to circumstances in which some Powers with an exclusive and special right to the veto in the Security Council act as prosecutor  judge and executioner. It is natural that countries that have been subjected to those Powers’ infringements of their rights have no hope of getting what they deserve from the Council.  Regrettably  humanity has witnessed that in all long wars   like the Korean and Viet Nam wars  the war of the Zionists against the Palestinians and against Lebanon  the war of Saddam against the people of Iran and the ethnic wars of Europe and Africa   one Security Council member was one of the belligerents or supported one party  usually the aggressor  against the other  or the conflict itself.  Let us take a look at Iraq. They first occupied the country and then received authorization from the Security Council   the same Council in which the same occupiers have the right of veto. Whom should the people of Iraq complain about  and where should they take their complaints  in the hope of securing their rights?  We saw in Lebanon that some Powers  for 33 long days  prevented the Security Council from taking any action against the Zionist regime with the hope of giving it time to achieve victory. Then  when they became disappointed at seeing their hopes unfulfilled  they decided to put an end to the hostilities by adopting a resolution. But the duty of the Security Council is to prevent the expansion of conflicts  to put ceasefires in place and to promote peace and security. To whom and to what organization should the people of Lebanon complain?  The presence of some monopolistic Powers has prevented the Security Council from performing its main duty  which is the maintenance of international peace and security based on justice. The credibility of the Council has been tarnished  and its efficacy in defending the rights of United Nations Member States has been undermined. Many nations have lost their confidence in the Council. Some other mechanisms  such as monetary and banking ones  are in the same undesirable situation and have been turned into tools that enable some Powers to impose their will on other nations. It is evident that these mechanisms are not capable of responding to current needs  solving challenges or establishing fair and sustainable relations.  Again  there is no doubt that the second and more important factor is that some big Powers disregard morals  divine values  the teachings of the prophets and the will of the Almighty. They allow the rule of the incompetent. How can the incompetent  who cannot even manage themselves and conduct their own affairs  govern humanity and arrange its affairs? Unfortunately  these people have put themselves in the position of God. They are in servitude to their own whims  and they desire to have everything for themselves. For them  human dignity and the lives  property and territories of others are no longer respected. For centuries  humanity has had a deep wound inflicted on its tired body by impious Powers. Today  the problems that people around the world face are mainly rooted in disregard for human values and ethics  as well as in the rule of the selfish and the incompetent.  The only sustainable approach to the betterment of humankind is a return to the teachings of the divine prophets  monotheism  respect for the dignity of humans and the flow of love and affection in all relationships  ties and regulations  and the reform of present structures on this basis. To fulfil this objective  I invite everybody to form a front of fraternity  amity and sustainable peace  based on monotheism and justice  under the name of the Coalition for Peace  to prevent incursions and arrogance and to promote the culture of affection and justice. I hereby announce that  with the help of all independent  justice-seeking and peace-loving nations  the Islamic Republic of Iran will be heading down this path.  Monotheism  justice and compassion for humans should predominate in all the pillars of the United Nations  and this Organization should be a forum for justice  where every member should enjoy equal spiritual and legal support. The General Assembly  representing the international community  should be considered the most important pillar of the United Nations and should  free from any pressure or threats by big Powers  take the required measures for the reform of the other United Nations structures including especially the reform of the Security Council. It should define new structures based on justice and democracy  with a view to becoming responsive to present requirements and settling existing challenges  thereby bringing about enduring stability and security.   The nuclear issue of Iran is a clear example of how such mechanisms perform and of the prevailing thoughts behind them. Members are all aware that Iran is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and has always observed its rules and regulations. It has had the most extensive cooperation with that Agency in all areas. All our nuclear activities have been completely peaceful and transparent.  According to the Statute of the IAEA  every member has a number of rights and obligations. In fact  all members have to stay on a peaceful path and  under the supervision of the Agency  assist other members  and they are entitled to be supported by the Agency and have access to the fuel cycle with the help of the Agency and its members.  Thus far  Iran has fulfilled all of its obligations but has been deprived of other members’ technical assistance and  even at times  of the Agency’s support. For about five years  some of the aforementioned Powers have  by exerting heavy pressure on the IAEA  attempted to prevent the Iranian nation from exercising its rights. They have derailed Iran’s nuclear issue from its legal tracks  and have politicized the atmosphere to impose their wishes through taking advantage of all their potential.  The Government of Iran spared no effort to build confidence  but they were not satisfied with anything short of the complete halt of all activities  even those related to research and university fields. They only sought to deprive the Iranian people of all their inalienable rights  even to the extent that centres not involved in the fuel cycle or not in need of supervision by the Agency were closed.  After three years of negotiations and attempts to build confidence  the Iranian nation came to the firm belief that the main concern of these Powers is not the possible deviation of Iran’s nuclear activities  but is to prevent its scientific progress under that pretext. If this trend continues  there will be no possibility for Iran to enjoy its rights  not even in the next 20 years. Therefore  Iran decided to pursue the issue through its appropriate legal path  one that runs through the IAEA  and to disregard unlawful and political impositions by the arrogant Powers.  In the past two years  abusing the Security Council  the arrogant Powers have repeatedly accused Iran and have even made military threats and imposed illegal sanctions against it. However  by the grace of faith in God and national unity  Iran has moved forward step by step  and now our country is recognized as one with the capacity for industrial-scale fuel cycle production for peaceful uses. Unfortunately  the Security Council  in dealing with this obvious legal issue  was influenced by some bullying Powers and failed to uphold justice and protect the rights of the Iranian people.  Fortunately  the IAEA has recently tried to regain its legal role as supporter of the rights of its members while supervising nuclear activities. We see this as a correct approach adopted by the Agency. Previously  they illegally insisted on politicizing the Iranian nation’s nuclear case  but today  because of the resistance of the Iranian nation  the issue is back with the Agency  and I officially announce that  in our opinion  the nuclear issue of Iran is now closed and has turned into an ordinary Agency matter. Today  many important questions have been raised about the nuclear activities of certain Powers within the IAEA  which should be dealt with properly. Of course  Iran has always been  and will be  prepared to have constructive talks with all parties.  I would like to thank all the nations and countries that  during this difficult period  defended the legal rights of my nation and motherland. I also want to express our appreciation to the members of the  Non-Aligned Movement  our friends in the Security Council and in the IAEA Board of Governors  the committed and law-abiding experts of the Agency and its Director General for standing by the law. I would also like to announce that  unlike the monopolistic Powers  the Iranian nation is ready to offer to other members its experiences in the form of educational programmes  based on its obligations under the Agency’s Statute and under Agency supervision.  Now I would like to address those who have shown hostility towards the Iranian nation for some five years and who have offended and accused my people  who have contributed to the history and civilization of the world. I advise them to learn from history and their recent actions. They badly mistreated the great Iranian nation  but they should be careful not to inflict the same on other members of international organizations  and not to sacrifice the dignity of international organizations for the sake of their unlawful wishes. Today the nations of the world are wide awake and resistant. If those Powers reform themselves  the whole world will be reformed. Nations are inherently good and can coexist peacefully.  Those Powers should endeavour to serve their own peoples; others do not need them. Is it not high time for these Powers to return from the path of arrogance and obedience to Satan to the path of faith in God? Would they not like to be cleansed of their impurities  submit to the will of God and believe in him? Faith in God means believing in honesty  purity  justice and compassion for others. They can be certain that they will benefit from purity  honesty  justice and loving and respecting human dignity. They can also be certain that such values are  more and more  considered appropriate  valuable and beautiful by the nations of the world.  This is the invitation of all the divine prophets from Adam to Noah  Abraham  Moses  Jesus Christ and Mohammed  peace be upon him. If they accept this invitation  they will be saved  and if they do not  the same calamities that befell the people of the distant past will befall them as well. According to the holy Quran: One who does not answer the divine call should not think that he has weakened God on Earth; he has no companion but God and he is clearly engulfed by darkness”. They have nothing of their own and cannot escape from the dominion of the rule of God and his will.  At this important gathering  I have to remind them of the following words of the Almighty  which are mentioned in the Holy Quran:   Do they not look at the powers and Governments which came before them? If the people of the past had actually possessed something  they would have kept it and would not have let you possess it now. God destroyed them because of their sins  and nobody could protect them against the will of God.  These Powers have to know that thoughts and methods based on oppression and injustice are doomed to failure. Do they not see the signs of vigilance and resistance based on monotheism  philanthropy and the justice-seeking spirit of the nations of the world? Do they not notice that we are nearing the sunset of the time of empires? I hope that this invitation will have a practical answer.  Peoples and Governments are not obliged to obey the injustice of certain Powers. Those Powers  for the reasons already mentioned  have lost the competence to lead the world. I officially declare that the age of relations arising from the Second World War and of materialistic thought based on arrogance and domination is well over now. Humanity has passed a perilous precipice and the age of monotheism  purity  affinity  respect for others  justice and true peace-loving has commenced.  It is the divine promise that the truth will be victorious and the Earth will be inherited by the righteous. Those who are free  believers and the people of the world should put their trust in God. Those who crave lofty values  wherever they are  should try to prepare the grounds for the fulfilment of that great divine promise by serving the people and seeking justice.  The era of darkness will end  prisoners will return home  the occupied lands will be freed  Palestine and Iraq will be liberated from the domination of the occupiers  and the peoples of America and Europe will be free of the pressures exerted by the Zionists. Tenderhearted and humanity-loving Governments will replace the aggressive and domineering. Human dignity will be regained. The pleasing aroma of justice will permeate the world and people will live together in a brotherly and affectionate manner.  Striving in that way to surrender rule to the righteous and perfect human  the promised one  is indeed the final cure for the wounds of humanity  the solution of all problems  and the establishment of love  beauty  justice and a dignified life throughout the world. That belief and endeavour is the key to unity and constructive interaction among nations  countries  the people of the world and all true justice-seekers. Without a doubt  the promised one who is the ultimate saviour  along with Jesus Christ and other holy prophets  will come. In the company of all believers  justice-seekers and benefactors  he will establish a bright future and fill the world with justice and beauty. That is the promise of God; therefore it will be fulfilled. Let us play a part in the fulfilment of all that glory and beauty.  I wish for a bright future for all human beings  the dawn of the liberation of and freedom for all humans  the rule of love and affection all around the world  as well as the elimination of oppression  hatred and violence   a wish that I expect to be fulfilled in the near future.

"80",3356,"IRQ",62,2007,"I am  honoured to address the General Assembly as the first Prime Minister of a constitutionally permanent Government representing Iraq  its people  and its aspirations in cementing the foundations of democracy  peace  freedom and cooperation with the international community. I come carrying the concerns of the people of the Valley of Two Rivers who built the most ancient civilization and established the first laws  and who today offer humanity a lofty example in sustaining life  facing challenges  and persisting in protecting our young democratic experience.  The Iraqi people lived isolated from the world in the shadow of dictatorship for 35 years. There was no freedom of expression or belief  no multiple party system  no free elections  no democratic institutions  no communications systems  and no media except those that were controlled by the Government intelligence agencies. Millions of victims in Iraq suffered throughout that era in adventurous wars with two neighbouring countries  Iran and Kuwait. Genocidal mass murder was committed inside Iraq  such as during the al-Anfaal campaign and in Halabja. In addition  there were mass graves  horrific prison cells and detention camps  and the immense destruction that plagued the infrastructure of the various governmental institutions.  Today in the new Iraq  there are hundreds of parties active within 20 political alliances. There are more than 6 000 civil society organizations  hundreds of newspapers and magazines  40 local and satellite TV stations  as well as the offices of foreign correspondents from all over the world working without restrictions or conditions.  The new Iraq is being targeted today. Terrorism kills civilians  journalists  artists  intellectuals and professionals; it attacks universities  marketplaces and libraries; it blows up mosques and churches and destroys the infrastructure of State institutions. We consider terrorism to be an extension of the fallen dictatorship  although it may vary in its external form or in the gangs that carry it out. Terrorism seeks to abort the political process and to ignite sectarian strife as a prelude to hijacking Iraq back into the era of tyranny  oppression and backwardness.  Car bombs  explosive vests in public places and the display of decapitated heads on television are all messages of threat and intimidation that terrorists send to the world community  the bloody chapters of which were executed in Algeria  Spain  England  France  Lebanon  Turkey and here in New York. We are steadfast and determined to exterminate and defeat terrorism in Iraq so that it does not spread through the countries of the world  repeating the tragedy.  Iraq  which carries the greater burden in confronting terrorism  calls upon the nations of the world to help and join in its efforts to fight the scourge of terrorism. Our battle aims at providing security  stability and prosperity  and at protecting our democratic experience. We are determined to be victorious in our battle  which will be a victory for humanity. The fierce onslaught of terror against Iraq since the fall of the dictatorship has not stopped our people  through three epic elections  from laying the groundwork for a democratic experience unique in Iraq’s history and the region  in which  as a permanent Constitution was voted upon  a parliament was elected and a National Unity Government was established.  The new Iraq living through its nascent democratic experience is governed by constitutional institutions  in which freedom of opinion  belief and expression are respected. That Iraq will not retreat from its democratic option  for which our people have paid a very high price. Our position requires the support and cooperation of the world’s nations so that Iraq can build a modern State that guarantees justice  equality and respect for religious  intellectual  sectarian and ethnic pluralism.  Our people  who have enjoyed the taste of freedom after eras of tyranny and oppression  will continue on the road towards building a State of institutions  reinforcing the authority of law  respecting human rights  and the active participation of women in all areas. The national reconciliation and dialogue initiative that I launched upon assuming my responsibility as the Prime Minister of the National Unity Government did not come out of thin air. Its strength arises from the Iraqi people’s civilization and cultural heritage  which have made great contributions to humankind. Iraqis have lived in peace  brotherhood  forgiveness and tolerance since the dawn of history. Their religious  national  sectarian and ethnic diversity have been elements of strength  reinforcing national unity.  We think of national reconciliation as a life boat  a perpetual peace project and a safe harbour for the political process and the democratic experience. We also believe that national reconciliation is not the responsibility of the Government alone. It is a collective responsibility held by the political powers  intellectual leaders  religious leaders  the educated  civil society organizations and all the active powers in the Iraqi arena. National reconciliation is the strategic choice that has saved our country from slipping into the pit of a sectarian war that was planned by the enemies of freedom and democracy after they blew up the tomb of the two Askari imams in Samara.  National reconciliation is not a dinner party prepared between those in dispute  nor is it a dose of medicine  as some might think. It is a realistic vision that counteracts the burdensome legacy of the fallen regime in all areas. It lays the foundation for political  social and economic progress and the security that we strive for. Furthermore  it cements the principles of the new political system.  National reconciliation is the olive branch that blossomed into the formation of support councils in many of our provinces and Iraqi cities. It was also successful in leading some 28 000 citizens from Iraqi tribes to join our military efforts to combat terrorism. It has resulted in the restoration of security in our cities  villages and provinces  including in Al-Anbar province  which has been liberated from the Al-Qaida terrorist organization. The terrorists fled from there  only to face another defeat  this time in Diyala province. Thus  Al-Qaida is losing its safe havens  one by one.  Indeed  national reconciliation is stronger than the weapons of terrorism. It caused the reintegration of more than 14 000 people who had been members of armed groups that splintered off from Al-Qaida. Those fighters stood alongside our armed forces and the multinational forces battling Al-Qaida  dealing devastating blows to that terrorist organization.   The practical accomplishments that have been achieved through constant mobilization for national reconciliation are considered important successes  in contrast to the great challenges facing Iraq and the experiences of people who have suffered from dictatorships and civil and sectarian wars.  We emphasize that the acts of sectarian violence being committed in Iraq are not perpetrated by the main elements of society  but rather by extremists and fanatics belonging to various groups. We have been successful in largely containing this problem. The average number of sectarian killings has decreased and security and stability have been restored in many former hot spots. That has helped the return of thousands of displaced families to their homes. We are resolved to fight any and all outlaws  regardless of their sectarian or political affiliations. Our armed forces have been steadfast in establishing law and order and in instilling a sense of respect for the Government in many provinces whose residents have diverse religious  sectarian and ethnic affiliations.  The skills and capabilities of our security and military agencies have grown swiftly as they have confronted terrorist organizations  militias and organized crime groups. However  they need further training and development so that they can quickly take over from the multinational forces the responsibility for security throughout Iraq. Having proved our ability to provide security in eight provinces  we are prepared to assume full and swift responsibility for security so that we can protect the democratic achievements of our people. We shall work to ensure that our armed forces act in a professional manner and are loyal first and foremost to our country  not to an individual party  sect or ethnicity.  In addition to those achievements  the Government of National Unity has begun the process of reconstruction. We have voted on the largest budget in Iraq’s contemporary history. With the cooperation of parliament  we have adopted the investment law  which is considered a step forward that will stimulate the Iraqi economy and move it from a centrally based system to one based on free enterprise and a market economy. That in turn will help to fulfil our people’s aspirations to development  prosperity and well-being. In addition  the Government has finalized a draft law for oil and gas  which if approved by parliament will ensure fair distribution of wealth  since oil is considered the property of all Iraqis.  The Government also continues to adopt and implement other laws in various areas. We have taken practical steps to improve our people’s living conditions  to increase salaries and pensions  to combat unemployment and to expand the efforts of the social welfare network. The Government is determined that next year will be dedicated to promoting the service sector in order to alleviate the hardships and suffering of our citizens.   We understand that these promising steps do not fulfil all our aspirations and that we have a long way to go until we achieve our goal of a secure  stable and prosperous Iraq. We hope that the international community will support Iraq and help it to achieve that noble goal.   We believe that security is an integrated system. A secure and stable Iraq will be in the best interests of the region and of the world as a whole. We have warned all countries in the region that the relentless flow of weapons  money and suicide bombers and the spreading of fatwas that incite hatred and murder will only spell disaster for the peoples of the region and the entire world.  After the Government of National Unity was formed  we took the initiative to improve Iraq’s relationship with neighbouring countries. We also took pains to make our common borders peaceful and economically prosperous areas. The foreign policy of the new Iraq is based on our permanent Constitution  which does not allow our land to be used against our neighbours and prohibits foreign interference in our internal affairs. Today  we feel optimistic that countries in the region are aware of the danger of the terrorist onslaught against Iraq and that a weak Iraq is not in their interests. A strong and democratic Iraq will be a guarantee of security and stability in the region.  Because of its new policies  Iraq has become a place for negotiations and dialogue between feuding regional and international entities. We will take steps to reinforce that positive role  adopting a policy of improving conditions  defusing crises and banishing the spectre of war and conflict from the region. We firmly believe that tension and instability undermine security not only in Iraq  but throughout the region and the world.  Iraq  which in recent decades has been a hotbed of tension in the region  is now qualified  by virtue of its material and human resources  to serve as a platform for regional and international economic cooperation. That will contribute to the establishment of an economic system that will produce development and prosperity for the peoples and countries of the region.  We also wish to express our sincere desire to establish the best possible relationship with the international community. We believe that Iraq must be open to all countries  developing relationships and benefiting from the experiences of other democracies.  As I stand before leaders and representatives of the world’s nations  I must recall that the Iraqi people continue to pay the price for the reckless politics of the previous  fallen regime and to experience the consequences of international resolutions  especially those relating to its weapons programme and its invasion of the brotherly State of Kuwait. Those resolutions  which were exploited by the previous regime for political gain  have caused much damage to our infrastructure  service sector and education and health systems. Our people are looking to the international community for help in repairing that damage and lifting the heavy burdens of debt and reparation.   The Iraqi people will remember the countries that made sacrifices and stood alongside them in bringing down the dictator’s regime. They will remember those who helped them during the transition to a democratic and pluralistic federal system. Moreover  they will always respect and appreciate the countries and Governments that support their political process and participate in the reconstruction process.   Our efforts  in partnership with the international community  to achieve economic progress and social justice culminated in success with the signing of the International Compact with Iraq and the implementation of its provisions. That document represents a new stage in the development of balanced relationships between Iraq and other Governments throughout the world. It is a point of departure in the building of a democratic  pluralistic  federal Iraq where all citizens are equal and will benefit from fair distribution of wealth after the burdens of debt  unemployment  and administrative and financial corruption left over from the days of the former regime have been lifted.  We hope that the countries concerned will comply with the provisions of the International Compact with Iraq. That will help the international community and encourage it to play its role in reconstruction and development and in supporting national reconciliation and the democratic experience.  Many of the region’s problems and crises can be resolved through constructive and focused dialogue. In order to maintain peace and security  our region must abandon the path of war and adventure  which has led to increased harm and suffering for the people.  Within this framework  we call for recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people  for assistance to them in establishing an independent State  and for the return of occupied Arab lands in accordance with international resolutions. The elimination of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East will indeed guarantee a just and comprehensive peace.   We call for the intensification of national  Arab and international efforts to help Lebanon and its political authorities to transcend the state of division and to bar interference in its internal affairs so that Lebanon can regain its national unity and cohesiveness.   To forge partnerships and to achieve peace  stability and prosperity  we must bolster cooperation among all countries of the world and must work together to attain the noble goals of the United Nations. This also necessitates ensuring equal and balanced relationships among States and developing a more fair and just global order by helping economically disadvantaged developing countries and reducing the development gap between poor and rich nations.  We support an active United Nations role in the international arena  peacefully resolving crises once it attains all the elements and support that it needs to play that important role. We call upon the United Nations to adopt peaceful initiatives that can help defuse conflicts  save people from the scourge of war and establish international security and stability. That will guarantee the rights and interests of all nations and will reinforce partnerships and cooperation among them. It will also provide the necessary environment for solving the problems and crises that face the world in a fair and just way.   Finally  on behalf of the Iraqi people  I wish to congratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I also want to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who played an important role in the United Nations adoption of the International Compact with Iraq to help Iraq carry out its reform programme of political  economic and security reform. My deep appreciation goes also to all countries that signed the Compact. "
"81",3403,"ISL",62,2007,"First  allow me to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election. At the same time  I should like to pay tribute to the work of your predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa.  On this occasion I want to say how much my country has benefited from the existence of the United Nations. The universal values enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have given a context and perspective to our sovereignty and self-determination. Iceland’s story is testimony to the fact that it is through civilized coexistence within the community of nations that societies prosper. Within living memory  Iceland progressed from being one of the poorest countries in Europe to one of the most prosperous. We have had the good fortune to be able to build a Nordic welfare society on the sustainable harvesting of our natural resources.   As a small  dynamic State without a military  it is our natural inclination to look for the peaceful settlement of disputes within the international community. Our independence  which we achieved some 60 years ago  is built on more than our democratic institutions  fundamentally important though they are. Our freedom in the widest sense has been achieved through economic development as well as the guarantee of human rights and democracy.   In our experience  freedom is complex and multifaceted. All human rights are universal  indivisible  interdependent and interrelated. But it is evident that poverty  inequality and the lack of economic and social rights can make the exercise of political and civil rights difficult.   We are now about halfway to our deadline for the Millennium Development Goals. The year 2015 is around the corner and we will soon need to deliver on our promises. There has been some good news: it seems likely that the goal of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015 will be reached. However  progress on many human development goals  such as on child mortality  has been disappointing. Regional challenges remain  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. It is incumbent upon those who have the good fortune to be prosperous to join in solidarity with others to make these rights available to all. What is more  the security challenges that we face this century are such that they can only be addressed together  in solidarity with others. Climate change is a prime example.  Indeed  the phenomenon of climate change is already devastating the lives of millions across a broad swathe of Africa  among many small island States and widely in Asia. Every region and most countries can expect to feel the effects of climate change in the near future. How we address this issue as an international community is a test of our commitment to the fundamental values of the United Nations and our ability to act together in light of our shared responsibility. The discussions that took place earlier this week were an important step in identifying means and measures in this respect  and I thank the Secretary-General for his initiative. Although climate change is a global phenomenon  it tends to be the poorest in developing countries that are hardest hit   those that are least responsible for causing climate change. Climate change is thus a severe threat to poverty reduction.  It is important that the international community treats adaptation to climate change not as a stand-alone issue but as an integral part of our common efforts to attain the Millennium Development Goals. A comprehensive approach is needed if we are to see results. The Government of Iceland is committed to showing solidarity with the most vulnerable in adapting to the effects of climate change.  Iceland regards women’s empowerment and full participation at all levels as a fundamental issue for the new millennium. Whether in relation to peace and security  health  poverty or climate change  the empowerment of women is the key to success. Women and men need to be equally represented and listened to everywhere. I should like to reiterate Iceland’s support for the recommendations of the High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence regarding gender equality and women’s empowerment. The current United Nations structure and approach to gender issues is too fragmented. The excellent work of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) must be built upon and reinforced within the new structures. We firmly support the establishment of a new gender entity to strengthen the performance of the United Nations in this field of work. Establishing the post of Under-Secretary-General for gender equality issues should provide strong leadership and coordination  and it is my hope that this post will be quickly filled. Gender mainstreaming has to be addressed throughout the whole United Nations system in a more systematic manner. Let us use the current momentum to bring this process forward at this session of the General Assembly.  Official development assistance (ODA) plays a vital role in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Let me state clearly that Iceland views these Goals as common goals. We see development as mutually beneficial co-operation. Freedom for Iceland has been built through development and it is a vital element of freedom for all peoples. Donors need to deliver on their promises and accelerate their efforts in increasing development assistance. The Government of Iceland stands ready to shoulder its responsibility. Our ODA has doubled over the past four years and we aim to be among the top ODA contributors. Increased aid effectiveness is central to development results. The Government of Iceland believes that the United Nations should be at the forefront of such efforts. We support the follow-up of the report of the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence (A/61/583)  which in our view will make the United Nations more effective in delivering results on the ground.  ODA is of course not a panacea. We need to make progress in international trade negotiations. When I had the privilege of attending the meeting of the African Union in Accra this summer  I was made aware by colleagues of the tremendous potential that African countries see in closer integration across that continent. In a globalized world closer regional cooperation and integration  including trade relations  has  in our experience  been a step towards a better future  a joint investment of nation States in their common well-being.  Iceland pledges full political support to our common goal of halting global warming. Bearing in mind that there is now a window of opportunity  which may close within a decade  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommendation on halving emissions should be taken seriously. Iceland has set itself a long-term aspirational goal of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 75 per cent by 2050. The Kyoto Protocol provides a basis for effective action by developed nations  which must lead the way in controlling emissions. But Kyoto is not universal and it is not enough. Iceland believes that the Bali meeting should start a process leading to a comprehensive climate agreement  ideally to be concluded in 2009  the year of the summit in Copenhagen. This agreement would cover the post-2012 period.   There is no “silver bullet” solution to the problem of global warming. The issue of deforestation  especially the rain forests  must be addressed. The role of new technology is crucial  particularly in regard to alternative  sustainable and clean sources of energy. In the field of geothermal energy  where Iceland has considerable experience  there is wide scope for development. New technology must not  however  exacerbate the very serious problems we already face. It is  for example  a matter of grave concern that increases in the production of biomass-based energy sources could be raising food prices. New sources of renewable energy must also adhere strictly to long-term environmental demands. This is particularly relevant to the planned build-up of nuclear energy reactors. The creativity and research capabilities of universities  the commitment and inclusiveness of non-governmental organizations and the drive of business and industry must be activated in a broad and consistent effort. Governments cannot do this alone.  Iceland regards human security  as formulated for example by the 2005 World Summit  to be of fundamental political and conceptual importance when it comes to discussing and deciding on action concerning peace and security. A key instrument for ensuring human security is Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)  which needs to be thoroughly implemented. Millions of individuals experience assaults on their personal security. I am thinking of the brutality inflicted by some Governments on their own people and by terrorists or irregular forces on civilians.   In this context allow me to express deep concern over events in Myanmar where the democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been held in detention for years and where the peaceful expression of political dissent is at present being brutally repressed.   I am thinking of the attacks on the providers of humanitarian aid in many conflict regions. I am thinking of the failure of authorities around the world to ensure the protection of women and children from violence and trafficking. In this context I should also like to encourage other Member States to support the draft resolution on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty.  I wish to express appreciation for the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General  the African Union Commission Chairman  and the Security Council in finding a way forward towards alleviating the suffering of the people of Darfur. There is however still much to be done.   Crucial discussions are currently in progress to solve the decades-long situation in the Middle East. It is clear to me that most people in Israel and Palestine yearn for peace. Indeed  opinion polls bear this out. In particular  women from both sides voice their distress at the long-term effects of continued conflict on their children  who are the future of this region. The talks in progress at the moment  with the support of the Quartet  the efforts of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee  and  most important  the efforts of the Israeli and Palestinian Governments  give some hope. I encourage political leaders to ensure that the will for peace among a great many people on both sides is reflected in the political process. This requires political courage and true leadership. It requires restraint when restraint is most difficult. It requires a determination to outflank the spoilers on both sides who wish to sacrifice the real prospects for a peaceful and fulfilling life for millions to the distant mirage of some unattainable utopia. Final status issues  which are critical to the Palestinians and the Israelis  must be on the agenda for the peace conference that the President of the United States has proposed. The outcome must give both sides a clear view of a realistic and acceptable future for their children. Meanwhile  all who have it in their power  bear a responsibility to do their utmost to ensure the humanitarian needs of the civilian population.  Jordan and Syria  neighbouring States of Iraq  have made generous provision for hundreds of thousands of refugees from Iraq. Iceland is determined to contribute to alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people and has pledged funds to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for the provision of schooling for Iraqi children in Jordan. We also stand firmly behind United Nations-mandated efforts to assist in the stabilization and rebuilding of the country.   Clearly a major threat to human security as well as State security is the proliferation of arms. Iceland regrets the current situation in the fields of arms control  disarmament and non-proliferation. Despite sustained efforts by the majority of Member States over a number of years  only limited progress has been made  some of it outside the United Nations framework. Our failures in this area pose a constant threat to peace and security. Now is the time to renew our efforts. The conclusion of an arms trade treaty would certainly be a significant achievement. A number of projects launched by the United Nations Summit of 2005 have made steady progress  including the establishment of the Human Rights Council and of the Peacebuilding Commission. The 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) also gave the General Assembly the task of reforming the Security Council. The momentum for completing this work must be maintained so that the Security Council can be more representative of our world at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This would entail an increase in the number of elected and permanent seats.   Iceland has been an active and committed Member of the United Nations since 1946. In the light of the principle of rotation and the importance of all Member States sharing in the responsibility of serving on the Security Council  we announced in 2000 our first-time candidacy for a seat for the period 2009-2010 with elections to be held next autumn. This candidature  which is actively supported by the other Nordic States   Denmark  Finland  Norway and Sweden   reflects Iceland’s firm commitment to play an active role in cooperation with others in addressing the most pressing security threats of the twenty-first century. As a Nordic country we stand for a long tradition of active commitment to the United Nations and to the best interests of the whole. The Nordics have a reputation for being bridge-builders   trusted mediators in complex situations. Iceland seeks to shoulder the responsibility to exercise with fairness and firmness the role of a Security Council member. "
"82",3450,"ISR",62,2007,"Three thousand years ago  the people of Israel journeyed from slavery in Egypt to independence in the land of Israel. The Bible tells us that on their voyage to liberty they made a crucial stop and received the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai.  As the General Assembly gathers this year  the Jewish people recall that historic journey by marking the festival of Sukkot. And every year  at this time  our people remember that the long march to freedom requires the acceptance of humanity’s basic values.  For 60 years  since the rebirth of our State in our ancient homeland  with Jerusalem at its heart  we have not lost sight of this principle. The core values of tolerance  coexistence and peace that lie at the heart of every democracy must be protected within societies and promoted between them. This is the calling of our generation.  The conflict in our region is driven by those who reject these core values   those who seek power without responsibility  those whose aim is not to realize their own rights but to deny those rights for others. At its heart  this is a conflict not about territory  but about values.  There is  of course  a territorial dimension to our dispute. We know this and  as we have proven in the past  we are prepared for the territorial compromise that lasting peace entails. But we also know  especially after withdrawing from Lebanon and Gaza  that territorial withdrawal by itself will not bring peace unless we address the core clash of values that lies beneath the conflict.  Israel may be on the front lines of this battle  but it is not our fight alone. This is a global battle. The notion that this battle is a local one  limited to isolated regions  collapsed in this city with the twin towers on a September morning six years ago. Today  it is clear that the extremists are engaged in a bloody war against civilians and communities  against hearts and minds  in every corner of the world.  And it is clear  too  that the Middle East conflict is not the cause of this global extremist agenda  but a consequence of it. Yes  it is up to the parties in the Middle East to settle their political conflict  and Israel  for its part  desires to do so. But for success to be genuine and lasting  you  the nations of the world  need to be partners in a shared global struggle against the extremism and terror that feed conflict  for your sake  not just for ours.  It is in this spirit that I would like to speak today about resolving our particular conflict  but also about  the wider battle being waged today   the battle that affects us all. This battle is global  not just because it targets civilians everywhere  but also because the extremists have taken aim at the fundamental pillars of every modern society   namely  democracy  tolerance and education. These are the new battlefields of the twenty-first century  and it is in these arenas  more than any other  that the future of our world will be decided.  I believe in democracy. I believe in its extraordinary power to produce free and peaceful societies founded on respect for human rights. Democracy is a profound ideal  but it is also a vulnerable one.  Today  in different parts of the world  extremists  who are opposed to the very ideals of democracy  are entering the democratic process  not to abandon their violent agenda but to advance it. As a spokesman for Al-Qaida recently declared  “We will use your democracy to destroy your democracy”. This should be a wake-up call for all of us.  It is time to reclaim democracy  and this begins by rejecting those who abuse it. Genuine democracy is about values before it is about voting. No true democracy on Earth allows armed militia or groups with racist or violent agendas to participate in elections. But some demonstrate a troubling double standard. There are some who insist on high standards in their own country but forget them when they look abroad. Violent extremists who could never run for office at home are treated as legitimate politicians when elected elsewhere. As a result  we empower those who use democratic means to advance anti-democratic ends. And we strengthen the forces of those who not only undermine their societies but also threaten our own.  Today  from this podium  I call on the international community to adopt at the global level what democracies apply at the national one: a universal set of standards for participation in genuine democratic elections. We need a universal democratic code that requires that all those seeking the legitimacy of the democratic process earn it by respecting such principles as State monopoly over the lawful use of force  the rejection of racism and violence and the protection of the rights of others.  The goal of such a universal code is not to dictate our values or to stifle legitimate voices with which we may disagree. Its goal is to protect core democratic values from those determined to use the democratic system against itself; and to make clear that participation in the democratic process is not just a right   it is also a responsibility.  I know that the temptation to engage with extremists can be strong. It may seem to promise stability and quiet. We may hope that by feeding the beast we can gradually tame it. As free societies  we pride ourselves  rightly  on our respect for difference and diversity. But we do a disservice to diversity when  in its name  we tolerate the intolerant.  Bitter experience has shown that buying off extremists is a short-term fix for which we will pay dearly in the long run. Instead  groups such as Hamas and Hizbullah must be presented with a clear choice between the path of violence and the path of legitimacy. They cannot have both. And it is this same stark choice that must be presented to the radical regime in Iran.  No responsible State disagrees that Iran is the most prominent sponsor of terrorism. It is a major source of instability and conflict in Iraq  Lebanon  Palestine and across the entire Middle East; and it is the enemy of Arab-Israeli coexistence. No one disagrees that Iran denies the Holocaust and speaks openly of its desire to wipe a Member State   mine   off the map. And no one disagrees that  in violation of Security Council resolutions  it is actively pursuing the means to achieve this end.  But there are still those who  in the name of consensus and engagement  continue to obstruct the urgent steps that are needed to bring Iran’s sinister ambitions to a halt. Too many see the danger  but they walk idly by  hoping that someone else will take care of it. What is the value  we have to ask  of an organization which is unable to take effective action in the face of a direct assault on the very principles it was founded to protect?  It is time for the United Nations  and the States of the world  to live up to their promise of never again  to say enough is enough  to act now and to defend their basic values. It is also time to see this same kind of moral conviction in the Human Rights Council  so that it can become a shield for the victims of human rights  not a weapon for its abusers.  Israel has never tried to avoid genuine discussion of its human rights record. But so long as the Council maintains its wildly disproportionate focus on Israel  it weakens the moral voice of the United Nations  and the price of this blindness is paid by the victims of human rights atrocities in Darfur and Myanmar and throughout the world.  There is no more accurate forecast for the future of a society than the lessons we teach our children. Unfortunately  in our region  we see children’s television programmes in which Mickey Mouse puppets teach the glory of being a suicide bomber and a seven-year old girl sings of her dreams of blood and battle. Religion  rather than being a source of hope and spiritual healing  is abused as a call to arms  as God is dragged once again onto the field of battle.  It is time to reclaim religion from those who have made it a weapon rather than a shelter. It is time to reclaim education from those who use it as a tool of hate rather than an opportunity. As always  the most powerful form of education  and the hardest  is to teach by example. We cannot expect our younger generation to value what we are not prepared ourselves to protect and pay a price for. And there is a price to pay. From the leader who has to withstand public pressures. From the businessman who has to forgo economic opportunity. From the teacher and spiritual guide who must find the inner strength to teach truth and tolerance in a climate of extremism and hostility. At all levels of society  there is a price to be paid. But if we do not pay it today  we  and those who follow us  will face a far greater bill tomorrow.  These thoughts are in my mind as we seek  today  to advance the cause of Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation. Reconciliation is not about deciding who was right or who was wrong in the past; it is about sharing a common vision and a common responsibility for the future. In the last months  Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas have been engaged in a sincere and genuine effort to reach the widest possible common ground on political understandings. There is no substitute for the bilateral process. Failure is not an option  but it is for the parties themselves to define success. The foundation for true peace lies in the vision of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security. The world shares this vision  but it is also important that it clearly embrace the two core principles that emerge from it.  The first of these principles is: two States  two homelands. Just as Israel is homeland to the Jewish people  so Palestine will be established as the homeland and the national answer for the Palestinian people  including the refugees.  The second is: living side by side in peace and security. Just as a viable and prosperous Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza is an Israeli interest  so must a secure Israel be a Palestinian interest. The world cannot afford another terror State.  Guided by these principles  the parties can define a common border and turn the two-State vision from a dream into reality. To succeed  we must set our sights on a brighter future  while responding to the challenges of the present and learning the lessons of the past. As we make progress on concrete political understandings  it is just as important to change the reality on the ground   to show Palestinians and Israelis that the promise of peace exists in practice  not just on paper.  In recent months  Israel has taken tangible measures to create a better environment  and we are ready to do more. We know that Palestinian life is full of day-to-day hardship. We know also  and only too well  the burden of terror that Israelis bear and of our primary obligation to their security. Together  we can change this reality; we do not need to submit to it.  We are not naive. We can see the difficulties ahead and the enemies of peace that stand in our way. But practical progress is possible in those areas where there is an effective Palestinian Government that accepts the Quartet’s principles and implements  alongside Israel  the existing Road Map obligations.  As the parties take the risks for peace  we look to the international community and the Arab and Muslim world to offer support  not to stipulate conditions. This support comes in many forms. It comes through economic and political assistance to the new Palestinian Government committed to coexistence and seeking to build the foundations of a peaceful and prosperous State. It comes through the clear endorsement of any political understandings reached between the parties. It comes through enhancing and deepening regional ties and cooperation between the Arab world and Israel  while in parallel we advance towards Israeli-Palestinian peace. And  finally  it comes by confronting those determined to prevent us from succeeding.  We must stand up to those who have no respect for human life or human liberty  those who hold captive soldiers - Gilad Shalit  Udi Goldwasser and Eldad Regev - whose families are with us today and whose pain remains always in our hearts.  We must stand up to those who  after we withdrew from Gaza to give peace a chance  chose not to build but to destroy and who choose  on a daily basis  to target Israeli homes and kindergartens with their missiles.  And we must stand up to those who see democracy as a tool to advance hate  who see tolerance as a one-way street and who see education as a means of poisoning the minds of the next generation.  I believe that  despite all the obstacles  there is a new moment of opportunity and an alliance of interest that favours peace. Time is of the essence. We owe it to ourselves and to our children to find both the courage and the wisdom to make the right choices in the right way.  On this festival of Sukkot  Jews commemorate the journey from slavery to freedom by leaving their homes to live in fragile huts  like the shelters in which our ancestors lived on their way to the Promised Land. For 3 000 years  these temporary huts  open to the elements  have been a reminder that stability and security are ensured not only by the structures that we build but also by the values that we share. Perhaps it is for this reason that the Sukkah  this fragile shelter  has become the Jewish symbol of peace.  We turn to Jerusalem and say in our prayers every day: Spread over us the canopy of your peace. May it be in our days  and for all nations. "
"83",3497,"ITA",62,2007,"I wish to offer you my heartfelt congratulations  Sir  on your election to preside over this sixty-second session of the General Assembly. Your experience in international affairs and your first-hand knowledge of the Organization make you particularly suitable for this important post. At the same time I sincerely thank your predecessor  Ms. Haya Rashed Al Khalifa  for her wise and dedicated leadership of the Assembly.  I want to begin my statement where I left off last year  with Italy’s decision to defend human rights in the world and to oppose the death penalty. In recent months  Italy has worked very hard to enable the Assembly to adopt a resolution on a universal moratorium on the death penalty  with a view to its complete abolition. It has been a source of great satisfaction to see support for our initiative growing day by day in Europe and in every other region of the world. We have now reached a decisive moment.  I trust that we shall all be united in this battle  which is supported by Nobel laureates  statesmen and stateswomen  and free men and women throughout the world  and that the “growing trend in international law and national practice toward a phasing out of the death penalty”   to quote Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (Press release SG/SM/10839)   will be officially sanctioned by this General Assembly’s adoption of the draft resolution we are about to submit together with many countries from every regional group and from the European Union. If genuine politics means showing foresight  we shall perform a great political act through the adoption of that draft resolution. It will demonstrate that humankind is capable of making progress not only in science  but also in the field of ethics.  A United Nations resolution against the death penalty will prove that human beings are better today than they were yesterday  even in moral terms. An outcome with enormous consequences  heralding a more just future  and a society that has at last freed itself from the spiral of revenge  demonstrating that it has heeded the ancient admonition: if you want peace  you must work for justice.  Last year we welcomed the ceasefire in Lebanon and the launch of the new United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  which has been under Italian command for several months now. Today  thanks in part to our common commitment  Lebanon is in a better situation  although it has not yet solved its problems  as the brutal attacks of recent days have unfortunately demonstrated.  We must continue to support the Lebanese reconciliation process and help the country to regain its unity through the election of a new President. We must do this without ignoring the root causes of the conflicts afflicting the Middle East  first and foremost the Palestinian question. In short  we must continue to mobilize support for reconciliation among peoples and within a single people.  Restoring peace to the Middle East is the top priority of the international community  because if one day this region should find greater peace  freedom and prosperity  we shall all live in greater peace  freedom and prosperity. I am therefore delighted that the United States has promoted a new international meeting. We are ready to provide our input and we are already preparing it  knowing that the more countries in the region that are behind this meeting  the greater the possibility of success.  Italy will continue to play its part in the rest of the region too  beginning with dialogue. For it is through dialogue that the most difficult issues can be resolved. I have never seen a lasting solution to a problem when the solution was imposed from above or from outside.  Today’s challenges  such as bringing peace to the Middle East  are complex. If we wish to overcome them we must rise to their dimensions. In other words  we have to set aside all partisan interests in a world that is increasingly shaped by global processes.  This applies also to climate change  to which this session is most appropriately dedicated. As I said yesterday at the panel convened by the Secretary-General  Italy considers climate change a priority issue. We are among the European supporters of a unilateral 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. We have made similar commitments on energy efficiency  renewable energy sources and biofuels. In Europe we have already made various strategic decisions  but it is obvious that any post-Kyoto agreement can only be achieved within the United Nations  because when speaking about global warming we are speaking about the pre-eminent global problem of our day.   National approaches to solving the world’s problems no longer exist. The era of making and unmaking national borders is long over. It is only through multilateralism  by marshalling everyone’s energies  that we can hope to do good.  Our task today is to adapt the multilateral structures at our disposal to a changing world and to think of new forms of global governance  for there is no other way to manage global processes.   The challenge facing Europe today is not to become resigned to the world as it is  but to seek to improve it based on the values in which Europe believes: freedom  democracy  respect for others  and respect for the rules of peaceful coexistence. That is why we are adapting our founding treaties. That is why we are building a common foreign and defence policy. That is why we have invented a new citizenship  European citizenship  to which we are entitled by choosing to share certain values  not by virtue of kinship or nationality.   The European dream is thus the child of the universal dream of the United Nations. In the past year the United Nations has continued to play a central role in resolving international disputes. The cases of Lebanon and Darfur demonstrate that if Member States are willing to give the United Nations a strong central role  the Organization is today up to the task. We have to ask ourselves what the United Nations needs in order to fulfil its worldwide mission and to be equally effective in different crisis areas.  First and foremost  we need an Organization capable of renewal and adaptation. In the past two years the revival of the reform process produced its first positive results. One essential aspect of reform relates to the General Assembly  which remains the main decision-making organ of the Organization. I never tire of repeating that we have to restore the General Assembly’s central position  and exploit its political guidance potential and  above all  its universality.  The principles of democracy and the representation of every Member State underpin the United Nations system. That is why we are opposed to any concept of Security Council reform that would establish new permanent members. The growing contribution of a growing number of countries to the Organization should not be wasted by introducing elitist and selective reforms.  It is clear that reforming the Security Council means addressing one of the fundamental pillars of the global security architecture. The Council’s central role and its nature as the paramount source of international legitimacy impel us to seek shared political solutions.   Last year  in this very Hall  I advocated that negotiations be started to break the deadlock and help strengthen the Organization. I spoke of the need to start negotiations based not on imposing predefined models and positions  but rather on the search for solutions based on the widest possible consensus.  I am therefore delighted that  one year later  the General Assembly has decided to make every effort  through intergovernmental negotiations among others  to reach a general agreement on Security Council reform that we all hope will open a new chapter with a view to an agreed solution  a solution that I hope can include strengthening the presence of the leading regional stakeholders in the Security Council. My country is ready and will not fail to demonstrate commitment and to contribute ideas in this new phase of the Security Council reform process.   Reform is also intended to make the Organization more effective in the areas and on the issues where  by history and vocation  it can provide greater added value: Africa and development issues.  The United Nations is deeply engaged in Africa. Over two thirds of the Blue Helmets are deployed in Africa on peacekeeping missions. Italy will pursue this goal through the establishment of the African Peace Facility fund  which will complement its European counterpart fund. Darfur and Somalia remain two of our central concerns. But it would be a mistake to look only at the negative side and forget the many encouraging signs of development and unity coming from Africa. I am referring to the growth of the economy and to the hope that has arisen in many parts of the continent.  In Europe we are now preparing for the second Africa-Europe Summit. I hope that it will be held successfully before the end of the year. Italy is working above all to ensure that the Summit will spark a European policy for Africa that is worthy of the name.  That brings me to development. It is the responsibility of the United Nations to keep development at the top of the international agenda. It will take more than lip service to the Millennium Development Goals to achieve them. We all have to work for their attainment. I have already expressed my willingness to sit at a table next year for a progress report on the implementation of the commitments we made seven years ago.  We can no longer ignore the reality around us: one half of world trade and investment benefits 14 per cent of the world’s population; the 49 poorest countries in the world receive 0.5 per cent of the global product; and 90 per cent of the planet’s wealth lies in the hands of only 1 per cent of its inhabitants. Efforts are needed from everyone  particularly those who have more to give. The G-8 can play an important role in this area. Here and now I pledge to make this issue the centrepiece of the Italian presidency in 2009.  The principles of solidarity and cooperation underlying this Organization are as sound today as they were 62 years ago. The spread of democratic values and greater attention to the protection of human rights should not make us forget that these principles and values are still threatened and violated in far too many parts of the world. What is more  insecurity leads more and more people and countries to close themselves off.  The danger is that this sense of insecurity can cause societies to regress. Even the most free and democratic nations  if they feel they are under threat  may adopt measures that will undermine peace and with it  the civil and political rights of their citizens.  In the face of such risks  the principles and values of the United Nations are our beacons and our stars. They make it possible for us to navigate even by night and in rough waters. Staying on course is not just a political imperative. It is above all a moral imperative for all of us. "
"84",3543,"JAM",62,2007,"It is my great pleasure  Sir  to extend to you warmest and most sincere congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. The Jamaican delegation is confident that much will be accomplished during the sixty-second session under your able leadership. You can be assured of the support of the Jamaican delegation in that endeavour.  To your predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  the Jamaican delegation extends its appreciation for her unstinting efforts in advancing the work of the General Assembly during its sixty-first session.  Jamaica also wishes to pay tribute to the laudable efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who  since his assumption of office in January of this year  has moved forward in earnest to enhance the process of reform of the United Nations.  I am deeply honoured to be addressing the General Assembly at its sixty-second session on behalf of my country  Jamaica. Today  I especially restate my country’s firm commitment to the ideals and principles of the United Nations and underscore Jamaica’s strong support for multilateralism  which must underpin the core processes in the execution of the functions and responsibilities of the United Nations. In doing so  I am driven by our resolve for change  as well as by the need for unity and for the reinvigoration of the United Nations in order for it to effectively and efficiently achieve the fundamental purposes set out in its Charter.   As we begin this session  we must not lose sight of our strategic objectives and vision towards the maintenance of international peace and security; the development of friendly relations among nations; the achievement of international cooperation in the economic  social  cultural and humanitarian fields; and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.   Looking back at the record over the past year  it is disconcerting that the challenges we face at the global level have not seen much discernable change. From a security point of view  the world continues to be plagued by seemingly incessant and protracted conflicts  such as those in the Middle East  parts of Africa and elsewhere. Millions of innocent persons are the victims of civil strife or are displaced as a result of violence and armed conflict. Terrorism  transnational organized crime and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction continue to threaten international peace and security.   From the economic and social perspective  we cannot escape the fact that we live in a world characterized by high levels of underdevelopment and social degradation   a world where too many people live in dehumanizing poverty. It is a world in which human security is being threatened by environmental degradation. The experience of HIV/AIDS and the constant threat of new pandemics underscore our interconnectedness and interdependence  demanding universal cooperation and collective action.   All States  developed and developing  large and small  are vulnerable to those threats and must of necessity have a shared commitment to strengthening collective security and safeguarding world peace and security. No nation can address those challenges and threats entirely on its own. Sustained collective action and global cooperation are required to identify and shape a common vision and agreed objectives to deal with the complexities of our times. In recent years  we have renewed our commitment to the United Nations as the catalyst for effectively advancing the interests of our peoples in the areas of development  peace and security  and human rights.   Unquestionably  there have been pockets of success in global economic progress over the past decade. By and large  however  our commitments have not been matched by the desired implementation of the targets for meeting basic human needs  human security and sustainable development. It is clear that much more needs to be done if we are to achieve the development targets in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.   The Government of Jamaica fully accepts that each country has the primary responsibility for setting development priorities through sound governance and policies. We believe that the goals that were solemnly agreed seven years ago are not overly ambitious and are still achievable. In that context  my Government is committed to taking further measures to pursue the objectives of the MDGs and other internationally agreed development goals. We are committed to providing the necessary framework that will promote social inclusion  enhance productive capacity and employment  and facilitate investment and sustained economic growth.   But many developing countries  such as Jamaica  cannot do it alone. The realization of the development agenda is dependent not only on our own domestic capabilities  but equally on the genuine commitment of all Member States to pursue a global partnership for development  which is at the core of the strategy for development. We believe  therefore  that it is imperative that we move beyond the simple reiteration of principles and translate commitments into action. We must give life to the aspirations embodied in the outcomes of international conferences on the basis of mutual responsibility and mutual accountability  with a fair expectation that obligations  as agreed  will be fully undertaken.   In all that we do  we must recognize that progress and uplifting the poor benefits all of us. It can mean the difference between conflict and stability  between hope and despair. As developing countries strive to put in place practical national development strategies  developed country partners must support those efforts through greater market access  debt relief  private capital flows  technological transfers and improved global economic governance. Jamaica therefore calls for renewed focus  as well as the necessary political will  to honour the commitments made for development  and urges the fulfilment of all obligations that we have collectively embraced so that we may effect real change in the lives of millions of impoverished people around the world.   A critical role in that process is official development assistance  including the fulfilment by developed countries of the official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income. The High-Level Meeting on Financing for Development provides an opportunity to enhance collaboration with our partners towards achieving that goal.   The unique situation of middle-income developing countries  such as Jamaica  also requires special attention. That varied group of countries  with per capita gross domestic product spreading from $900 to $10 000  is by no means a homogeneous group and possesses its own particular vulnerabilities. Greater efforts must be made to address the needs of middle-income developing countries  in particular the high level of indebtedness that those countries face.   Globalization and economic liberalization have resulted in the increased exposure of developing countries to external economic forces over which they have little control. We should refuse to accept that globalization creates winners and losers. What we should strive for is a win-win and inclusive process in which the benefits and opportunities are more widely enjoyed across countries and regions.   An enabling international environment also requires a global trading system that is fair and equitable and that is conducive to development and integration in the world economy. A continued cause of grave concern to Jamaica is therefore the current impasse in the negotiations in the Doha Development Round  in spite of commitments to work expeditiously towards implementing the development dimensions of the Doha work programme. We must summon the necessary political will to reignite trade negotiations  with the development agenda as the centrepiece of the discussions as we seek to integrate developing countries in the multilateral trading system.   It is important that the creation of a viable and equitable trade regime also recognize diversity in the levels of development and size of economies. A one-size-fits-all model disregards the complexities and unique circumstances of countries. Jamaica will therefore continue to insist that new trading arrangements take account of that differentiation  especially as it concerns small vulnerable economies. The principle of special and differential treatment seeks only to level the playing field and to give developing countries a fair chance to participate meaningfully in global trade. At the same time  we will also join other developing countries in pressing for the removal of support for agricultural products by certain developed countries as a precondition for further market access for such products.   We call for and join in continuous and concerted international efforts to fight the spread of communicable diseases  including HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria and others  particularly bearing in mind that they are all preventable. The global impact of AIDS has been particularly devastating. The high prevalence in many countries  especially in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean  is cause for alarm. It should be noted that the pattern of high prevalence and high heterosexual transmission is strongly associated with poverty.   While noting the international response through the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria  we stress the need for increased funding to help support developing countries to fight the pandemic. We are particularly concerned that the countries of the Caribbean  including Jamaica  are placed at a disadvantage in accessing the necessary funding to curtail the spread of the disease owing to their assigned middle-income status.   Implementing a global response to climate change must remain a priority as we seek consensus for combating global warming beyond 2012  when the Kyoto Protocol expires. As we prepare for the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bali  Indonesia  we are encouraged that the recent High-Level Event on Climate Change and the General Assembly informal debate on climate change reinforced the urgency with which issues pertaining to environmental sustainability have to be tackled.   The principle of common but differentiated responsibility must be applied across the board. We are equally convinced that the international community must assist small island developing States in incorporating climate change adaptation and mitigation concerns in national sustainable development plans and assist them by improving access to environmentally sound technology related to climate change.   Jamaica and other countries in the Caribbean are all too familiar with the adverse effects of climate change and associated phenomena  including the rise in sea-level and the increase in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and other weather events that threaten the sustainable development  livelihoods and the very existence of small island developing States. In my own country  the onslaught of Hurricane Dean on 19 August resulted in the loss of life and extensive damage to infrastructure  property and the agricultural sector  as well as in the loss of livelihood for many.   The threat of terrorism transcends boundaries and has had a devastating impact on the economic development of States  whether directly or indirectly. It is imperative that we negotiate and conclude a comprehensive convention against terrorism. We must also invigorate disarmament and non-proliferation efforts.   There is a need to comprehensively address the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons  which have the capacity to kill and maim thousands of people. Jamaica has first-hand experience of high levels of gun violence and the unwarranted burden it places on our social and economic system. We urge the international community to give priority attention to this menace  including through the creation of a legally binding instrument containing stricter controls on the illegal trade in small arms and ammunition. Likewise  we support the proposal for the establishment of an arms trade treaty.   A major priority of the United Nations is not only winning the peace  but more importantly keeping and sustaining the peace. Jamaica fully supports the work of the Peacebuilding Commission  which earlier this year celebrated its first anniversary and whose groundbreaking work is assisting in post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction. As a member of the Commission  Jamaica looks forward to the continuation of the dialogue as we seek to build on the successes of the recent past  always mindful that the countries under consideration require swift action to implement priority projects as part of the rehabilitation and reconstruction process.   The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) continues to be seized of developments in Haiti. We reaffirm the importance of the continued engagement of the international community and  in this regard  welcome the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) to assist in the stabilization process. We also encourage support from the international community to meet the long-term social  economic and development needs of Haiti.   We must remain unwavering in our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and the rule of law. Much more needs to be done to ensure that the basic rights of individuals are universally protected and that transparent and accountable governance prevails at the local and international levels.   Jamaica is honoured to assume the Chairmanship of the Third Committee during the General Assembly at its sixty-second session  as part of our commitment to ensure that human rights are promoted and protected globally. In this regard  we are particularly keen to help guide the Committee’s work in promoting and protecting the rights of marginalized and vulnerable groups. Jamaica recognizes the importance of the protection of the human rights of women  which is critical to the international processes aimed at achieving gender equality and the development of women.   Late last year a significant milestone was achieved with the adoption by the United Nations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities with the distinction of being one of the most supported conventions at its opening for signature in March 2007. Jamaica is pleased to have been the first country to ratify the Convention and encourages others to accede to the Convention as a sign of their commitment to ensuring that the rights and dignity of the disabled are promoted and protected. We also welcome the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.   The deteriorating humanitarian situation in Darfur remains a matter of grave concern and preoccupation of the international community. Jamaica therefore welcomes the recent unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 1769 (2007) for the deployment of the joint African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur to the region. We are encouraged that by certain developments that indicate that this kind of cooperation has begun and urge that these efforts be intensified.   The process of reform of the United Nations seems prolonged and challenging  with little or no consensus in the various proposals put forward for improvements in the functioning of the United Nations and its main organs. We must redouble our efforts to revitalize the General Assembly  so that it can effectively carry out its role and responsibility as the chief deliberative and policy-making organ of the United Nations. We must also work towards a reformed Security Council that is more inclusive  more representative and more transparent.   This year marks the bicentenary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. Member States of the Caribbean Community are heartened by the overwhelming solidarity of the international community in marking the event at the special commemorative meeting of the General Assembly in March and other activities during the course of the year to memorialize the victims of this egregious period in our history.   A significant element of the commemoration is a plan to honour the victims of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery  through the erection of a permanent memorial in the halls of the United Nations. We are grateful to Member States that have contributed or pledged towards the permanent memorial account that has been established and look forward to your further support and contributions towards the erection of the memorial.   We are 192 Member States; we have the fundamental tools and the required level of expertise to effectively address the major challenges facing us today. It is now clear that we must also have a steadfast will and a shared commitment towards a radical change from the existing mindset in favour of positive action  if the United Nations is to successfully respond to challenges  which continue to hamper the attainment of its objectives for peace and sustainable development.   In calling for radical change in the existing mindset and in the way we discourse and take actions on international issues  we should be guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter. A change in our mindset will require a rethinking on the part of all Member States as we seek to promote world peace and achieve economic and social development. It will also require a deep search in the conscience of all States as we seek to adhere to our obligations under international law with due regard for the collective will of the international community.   This radical change in the existing mindset will necessarily require us to be more responsible as Member States of a united Organization  more responsible as citizens of this one world and more focused on the shared responsibilities that come with our membership in the United Nations.   Let us not falter in our obligation to ensure that the Organization not only remains responsive to the vast array of concerns and demands of its diverse membership  but that it is able to do so without compromising the noble ideals and principles on which it was founded.  This process begins with a conscious determination and political resolve to transform not only our modus operandi  but the thinking that informs it. Jamaica stands ready to play its part in this endeavour and calls upon all Member States to do likewise.  "
"85",3589,"JOR",62,2007,"Allow  me to congratulate the President on his assumption of the presidency of this session of the General Assembly and wish him every success in leading its deliberations. I should also like to extend my thanks to his predecessor Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her good management of the deliberations of the previous session. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his unrelenting efforts since he assumed his office to advance the work of the Organization and activate its role in the service of international peace and security.  The President returned to the Chair.  The Middle East region  of which Jordan is an integral part  continues to face formidable challenges stemming from the failure to make any progress towards solving its main regional issues. Jordan  however  has realized that these challenges should not become a justification for abandoning its national priorities regarding political and economic reform and for achieving the highest degree of openness and participation. Therefore  Jordan has adopted a national strategy that strikes a balance between continuing to effect reform and protecting its national security.  Jordan has also continued to deal with regional issues on the basis of its belief that it is necessary to reach just solutions by peaceful means and in a way that protects the rights of all concerned and that achieves regional stability. Jordan is firmly convinced that the use of military force and the imposition of unilateral solutions lead only to the aggravation of problems  increase the suffering of the people and threaten regional and international stability.  The Palestinian question  which is at the core of the Middle East conflict  is now at a decisive crossroads: either the regional parties and the international community succeed in making real and tangible progress and reach a just and lasting solution within a reasonable and agreed-upon time frame  or the entire region will be swept into extremism and anarchy  which will be a grave threat to world peace and security. Therefore  the international meeting scheduled to be held before the end of this year may be the last chance to make that progress. This makes it imperative for the United States  which called for that conference  the members of the International Quartet and the regional parties to prepare for it well  ensuring that final status issues between Palestine and Israel are seriously discussed and in a way that will allow real progress to be made on those issues and a lasting agreement to be reached and implemented quickly within a time frame agreed upon by the two parties.  The situation in the region cannot withstand the continuation of developments that do not allow for real progress. The holding of international and regional meetings and negotiations should not be an end in itself but rather a means to an end  namely reaching a real peace  accepted and preserved by the peoples of the region. Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been going on for a long time. The whole world knows that records of those negotiations contain alternatives that provide solutions for final status issues. What is needed now is the political will to reach an agreement instead of looking for pretexts and prolonging the negotiations.   Israel will never enjoy the security it seeks and the Middle East region will not enjoy stability unless the Palestinian people recover their national rights through the establishment of an independent  contiguous and viable Palestinian state in the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967  including East Jerusalem  and unless other Arab occupied territories are returned. The current situation in the Palestinian territories is not at all in harmony with the wish to achieve peace. In order to give the impression of honest movement towards peace  settlement activities must stop immediately  as must tampering with the status of East Jerusalem  including stopping all excavations in the Jerusalem holy sanctuary at Haram al-Sharif and putting an end to all practices that violate international law  in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Achievement of the desired progress requires a vast change to the tragic situation experienced by the Palestinians living in the occupied territories. There is an immediate need to revive the Palestinian economy in a manner that would lead to launching investment  creating vital projects and providing work opportunities. That revival will not materialize unless the Palestinians enjoy freedom of movement  which requires ending the closures  removing security roadblocks and stopping military operations. It is also imperative to enable the Palestinian National Authority  led by President Mahmoud Abbas and his legitimate Government  to rebuild its institutions so as to succeed in executing its national programmes  which deserve financial support from the international community.  A united and stable Iraq constitutes an essential component of balance and stability in the region. While Jordan welcomes the adoption of Security Council resolution 1770 (2007)  it supports the United Nations playing a central role in ensuring reconciliation and stability in that country. The preservation of any achievements on the security front will be accomplished only within an appropriate political environment  and this will necessitate real national reconciliation that will guarantee the participation of all segments of the Iraqi people in a political process based on reviving Iraqi nationalism rather than sectarianism and ethnicity. It must be founded on the basis of the unity of the State and the sole right of the State to maintain security and ban militias from encroaching on that exclusive right. Moreover  we must prevent any interference in Iraq’s internal affairs  whilst implementing what has been agreed upon  including a review of the Constitution and other laws and the building of national security and government institutions.  The fact that huge numbers of Iraqis have been forced to leave their country puts a tremendous burden on neighbouring countries  including Jordan. Jordan continues to host hundreds of thousands of Iraqis  with all the pressures that this imposes on Jordan’s economy  resources and infrastructure  with little help from the international community. While we call on the international community to stand by us in dealing with this huge burden  we believe that a lasting solution to this problem lies in restoring stability to Iraq  so that its citizens can return to their country and contribute to its reconstruction.   Jordan and the Arab Group condemn the assassinations that have taken place in Lebanon  the latest of which being the assassination of member of Parliament Antoine Ghanem  a few days ago. These assassinations reflect the dangerous situation in that country and highlight the need for the international community to take a firm stand in putting an end to these grave violations of Lebanese sovereignty and to take all measures to stop any foreign interference in its internal affairs. This will ensure that the Lebanese people will find appropriate solutions through their constitutional institutions so as to ensure internal legitimacy  including the holding of presidential elections in accordance with the Constitution and within the time frame provided therein.  Jordan is working today within the Group of Eleven  which was launched at the initiative of His Majesty King Abdullah II to establish economic cooperation and support the development process of lower-middle income countries. We look forward to working with other States and groups of States  including  in particular  the Group of Eight (G-8)  in order to establish cooperation that will enable the Group of Eleven members to preserve their economic accomplishments and achieve a breakthrough that will lead to success in attaining sustainable development.  Confronting extremism and terrorism requires more effective international cooperation as well as activating channels of cultural and religious dialogue  especially within the United Nations system. At the same time  there is an urgent need to refrain from Islamophobia and from inciting animosity against this tolerant divine religion. Today’s world requires a more effective United Nations role in addressing international challenges  such as human rights  armaments  climate change  terrorism  international crime  poverty  hunger  infectious diseases  and increasing factional  sectarian and ethnic conflicts. In this context  we emphasize the importance of building upon what has been achieved  and we call for advancing the process of reform of the United Nations and its agencies in order to enable them to enhance their performance. We view the reform process as vital and of the highest priority. Jordan will continue to play a constructive role in this area and will continue to offer reasonable and applicable visions  especially within the context of reforming the work mechanisms of the Security Council.  Finally  I assure the Assembly that Jordan will keep its commitments to the achievement of international peace and security. The size of the Jordanian forces participating in peacekeeping operations and their geographically wide deployment reflect the actual role of Jordan in the United Nations system and reflect also its political will to help accomplish the mission of the Organization. We take this commitment very seriously and place the resources  professionalism and discipline of our armed forces at the service of international peace and security. "
"86",3636,"JPN",62,2007,"First  let me join other speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I should also like to pay high tribute to Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her leadership during the previous session. My great appreciation goes as well to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dedication and initiative in addressing the many challenges confronting the United Nations.   In the face of new challenges  the United Nations needs to transform itself from forum to actor. The demands of the twenty-first century call for the creation of a United Nations that is proactive. I commend the Secretary-General’s determination to bring about this change. It is no coincidence that  given the current international environment  Japan also has embarked on a proactive foreign policy. With our approaches thus in harmony  Japan and the United Nations can and must work together. In my remarks this evening I will emphasize two areas in which the cooperation between the two actors may be optimized: climate change and African development. I will also touch on the need for United Nations reform  notably the reform of the Security Council  so that the United Nations may address those missions effectively.  In the era of globalization  the international community has come to face new challenges that reach across borders. In particular  climate change will be a crisis for all humanity  not only the people of today but also the generations of the future. Now is the time for all of us to take action for future generations  giving special consideration to vulnerable countries. Let us leave behind discord and division among nations and shift gears to combine our efforts in order to face this common challenge. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has indicated that the fact of global warming is unequivocal  so world leaders have the responsibility to make bold new political decisions to address this growing challenge. With such responsibility in mind  Japan presented a new proposal on climate change in May and has proposed that we collectively embrace a long-term vision for developing innovative technologies and building a low-carbon society. Japan has also called for a mid-term strategy for a new framework that includes all major emitters of greenhouse gases.   We need to tackle climate change without pause up to and beyond 2012. In this regard  I highly commend the political commitment expressed by world leaders at the high-level event held on 24 September under the initiative of the Secretary-General. Japan for its part will contribute to the negotiations for an international agreement through the Group of Eight (G-8) Hokkaido-Toyako Summit to be held next year  and will feed the results back into the United Nations process.  Japan has gained in international competitiveness by improving energy efficiency and decreasing oil consumption during a period in which its gross domestic product (GDP) doubled. We are ready to share our technologies and experience  which hold the key to achieving environmental preservation  energy security and economic growth in tandem. At the same time  each and every one of us needs to move forward from mere ideas and reconfigure our own way of life. Japan is promoting a new national campaign aimed at reducing the carbon dioxide emissions of individual households  in addition to the introduction of the Cool Biz   casual dress code   initiative. The spirit of mottainai   rejecting wastefulness   and the Three Rs initiative to reduce  reuse and recycle waste also contribute to this aim. It is my intention to globally broaden the campaign to restructure our lifestyles. To that end  my Government values exchanges with corporations  academics  non-governmental organizations and various other actors in public forums  while at the same time cooperating with the United Nations Global Compact.  Another priority area for Japan is African development. Africa as a whole is now undergoing positive change. Peace is being consolidated in several former conflict areas. Meanwhile  many countries  both with and without natural resources  are growing robustly.   For Africa to become a more vibrant continent  a continent of greater hope and opportunity  three things are particularly important in addition to the prevention and resolution of conflicts. First and foremost  economic growth must be enhanced and sustained. Secondly  human security needs to be ensured through the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the consolidation of peace and the establishment of democratic governance. Finally  the issues of the environment and climate change must be addressed.   Japan will host the fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV) in Yokohama in May 2008. TICAD  whose first meeting was held in 1993  is a process open to all. The TICAD process places particular importance on African ownership and true partnership with the international community. The three areas that I have just mentioned will be the focus of the discussion at TICAD IV  which will be a fresh opportunity to mobilize the knowledge and resources of the international community for African development. South-South cooperation between Asia and Africa will remain a key feature in the TICAD process.   Without peace in Africa  the world at large will not enjoy peace and prosperity. Japan cannot ignore the situation in Darfur. Faced with the world’s worst humanitarian crisis  Japan has provided assistance amounting to approximately $85 million. Japan also welcomes the establishment of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur and looks forward to its early deployment as well as to steady progress in the political process in Darfur. Japan intends to further enhance its contribution for the consolidation of peace and stability in Africa.  Peace paves the way for development and human security. However  achieving peace is not an easy task. Iraq  for example  is struggling to achieve security and reconciliation  and the foundation for peace remains weak. Japan has been assisting the reconstruction efforts of the Iraqi people by measures such as dispatching its Self-Defence Forces and providing official development assistance of up to $5 billion.   To help in the reconstruction of Afghanistan  Japan has played a leading role in the field of disarmament  demobilization and reintegration and the disbandment of illegal armed groups  working in close cooperation with the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. Japan hosted the Conference on Disbandment of Illegal Armed Groups in Tokyo in June this year to contribute to the rebuilding of Afghanistan through joint efforts with the United Nations.  To build peace  it is essential for the international community to ensure a seamless and comprehensive effort to fulfil tasks ranging from resolving conflicts to assisting reconstruction. As current Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission  Japan is resolved to make a significant contribution to such international efforts. One concrete measure that has been taken is the launch of the Hiroshima Peacebuilders Centre to train civilian experts in Asia to better respond to various needs on the ground.   Free and fair elections and democracy are also essential for the consolidation of peace. Japan spares no effort to provide assistance in order to promote democratization. Japan has dispatched election observer missions to a number of countries  including Timor-Leste and Sierra Leone. Japan has also provided election-related support and dispatched arms monitors to Nepal.   It is extremely regrettable that the crackdown on the demonstrations in Myanmar has caused casualties  including the death of a Japanese citizen. Japan calls on the Government of Myanmar to exercise utmost restraint and to refrain from the use of oppressive force. Japan demands that the Government of Myanmar make every effort to resolve the situation through dialogue.  Along with democracy  the rule of law helps to lay the groundwork for peace and prosperity. To promote the rule of law in the international community  Japan will accede to the Statute of the International Criminal Court next month  and is helping to improve legal systems in developing countries. In February  in order to give proactive support to the norm-setting role of the United Nations  Japan signed the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and today I have signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Behind those endeavours lies the conviction that the international community must cooperate in addressing international challenges based on such fundamental principles as freedom  human rights  democracy and the rule of law. The primary pillar of such fundamental values is respect for human dignity. The issue of abductions by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea poses a serious challenge to human dignity. It is essential that the international community send a strong message calling for the earliest resolution of the abduction issue so that the victims and their families may be reunited and have an opportunity to recapture their former happiness. Japan will continue to work towards the resolution of this issue as well as the settlement of the issues of the unfortunate past through dialogue in accordance with the Pyongyang Declaration. With hope for an improvement of the human rights situation  Japan will also pursue the adoption of a draft resolution on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea at this session of the General Assembly.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery is another challenge that requires the undivided attention of humankind. From that point of view I welcome the Security Council’s adoption by consensus of a series of resolutions on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran. It is now up to all of us to translate the will of the international community into concrete action through full implementation of the relevant resolutions. Japan will continue its efforts to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula through the Six-Party Talks. Japan will also continue to urge Iran to heed the unanimous voice of the international community and suspend its enrichment-related activities.   Nuclear disarmament should receive no less attention. I reiterate here the determination of my country to reinforce international efforts for nuclear disarmament  as the only country in the world that has suffered nuclear devastation. Japan will again submit a draft resolution at this session of the General Assembly to map out concrete measures towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons.  The issue of terrorism also requires sustained efforts as it becomes increasingly complex. In that regard  Japan welcomes the adoption of Security Council resolution 1776 (2007). For our own part  we will make efforts to continue our refuelling activities in the Indian Ocean to fulfil our role as a responsible member of the international community. Japan also supports the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288). Furthermore  to strengthen the legal counter-terrorism framework I call upon every State to exercise the utmost flexibility for an early conclusion of the negotiations on a draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism.  In the face of a variety of threats to international peace and security  the Security Council has come to play a more relevant role than ever before. For the Security Council to live up to its expected responsibilities  we need to make it more representative and effective. I therefore renew Japan’s determination to pursue early reform of the Security Council  with the expansion of both the permanent and non-permanent membership. As has been reiterated time and time again  no reform of the United Nations will be complete without reform of the Security Council. The momentum for such reform  renewed by former Assembly President Al-Khalifa  must be strengthened as we enter the sixty-second session. All Member States must work together so that we can achieve concrete results through intergovernmental negotiations during this session.  What is required today is not to wait for change  but to bring it about. The question is not what to expect of the United Nations  but how we may revitalize the Organization. We need to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to deal with new challenges.  In addition to striving to implement Security Council reform  Japan will actively engage in efforts to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security. Japan also supports the ongoing endeavours to enable the United Nations system to work more coherently and effectively in the areas of development  humanitarian assistance  the environment and human rights. At the same time  we need to achieve concrete results in management reform.  In connection with reform  let me remind Member States that world leaders took a major step forward in 2005 by resolving to delete the long-obsolete “enemy States” clauses from the United Nations Charter at the earliest opportunity (see resolution 60/1  para. 177). Next year  Japan will take centre stage in international efforts. At TICAD IV in Yokohama and the G-8 Summit at Tokyo  Japan will set forth principles for dealing with imminent international challenges. I hope to bring back solid results to New York a year from now.   Let me conclude my remarks by renewing Japan’s unwavering commitment to work  in close cooperation with the United Nations  to change the world for the better. "
"87",3661,"KAZ",62,2007,"I want  to invite us all to take a short journey down memory lane and recall that in 1946 the United Nations General Assembly  convened for the very first time  by its very first decision established a Committee to deal with the problems raised by the discovery of atomic energy.  Almost nothing has happened since that time to allay the fears of humankind. On the contrary  the race to possess nuclear weapons  which even terrorist organizations have now joined  has continued unabated. Even though the community of nations has long recognized the need to reform the international security system  there has been no real progress.  The lack of an international consensus on the issue has led to a dramatic weakening of the collective security system. Speaking in general terms  we are dealing with a systemic crisis of international governability  and the international community is running out of legitimate levers capable of stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction.  Quite apart from any ethical  economic or other such considerations  we need to erect legal barriers to stop proliferation. For this reason  Kazakhstan proposes that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) should be adapted to accommodate the new realities.  It should be acknowledged that the NPT has become an asymmetrical agreement under which sanctions are applicable only to non-nuclear States. Yet  if nuclear Powers call for the development of nuclear weapons to be banned  they themselves should set an example by reducing and renouncing their nuclear arsenals. That is not the case. This unfairness is an inducement for those States that still aspire to acquire weapons of mass destruction. I would only add that  to our way of thinking  this aspiration is irrational.  The people of Kazakhstan have lived through all the horrors of the effects of nuclear explosions. Four hundred and fifty-six such explosions were conducted at the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground.  It was for this reason that the first milestone decision taken by Kazakhstan after gaining its independence was to shut down the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing site. That was followed by the renunciation of its nuclear missile arsenal  the fourth largest in the world  and the dismantling of its infrastructure. I want to note here that at that time we had not only the trained personnel but also practically all means for delivery of nuclear warheads.  Those steps have shaped the strategy of our State in the area of global security. For the first time in human history  a nation possessing destructive force has given it up voluntarily.  I am sure that by taking that action Kazakhstan established trust in the world. Thanks to that step  the country has witnessed an inflow of considerable investment that has become the foundation for impressive achievements in development known today throughout the world. By taking that step  we consolidated our independence  having received security assurances from all nuclear-weapon States. I have a question for others: why not follow our example  instead of wasting astounding amounts on the arms race?  Over recent years  international terrorism has significantly undermined world security. International drug trafficking serves as a financial pillar of terrorism. Today  the international drug industry accounts for a third of the annual volume of the “economy of terrorism”. It is a well-established fact that terrorism finds fertile ground in unstable and poor countries. We have such a country in our region  Afghanistan. That country is driving an ever-growing trade in drugs.  Poor countries need the assistance of developed nations. They need assistance that would give tangible results. Thanks to a thriving economy  our country  until recently a foreign aid recipient  has joined the group of “new donors”. Over the last few years  Kazakhstan has seen its economy grow at an annual rate of some 10 per cent. And now we are in a position to help our neighbours.   We are concerned with the difficulties in the process of reconstruction of Iraq and the stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan. The peoples of our region  like the entire international community  count on a peaceful solution of the so-called crisis around Iran. The best way to achieve that is for Iran  whose people have a great history and culture  to prove the peaceful character of its nuclear programme.  Today  the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations remain the most effective instrument for the peaceful settlement of regional crises. Fifteen years ago  from this rostrum  Kazakhstan put forward an initiative related to the enhancement of the Organization’s peacekeeping potential. We proposed the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping fund  with States voluntarily contributing 1 per cent of their military budgets.  That idea has been supported by the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who has proposed to redirect 1 per cent of global military spending to development. I believe that such a decision would constitute an important step towards the implementation of the United Nations strategy to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  Allow me now to draw the Assembly’s attention to a number of issues that are important in the context of Kazakhstan’s cooperation with the United Nations and its Member States.  First  Kazakhstan welcomes the decision by the General Assembly to identify problems involving climate change as a priority theme of the current session.  In this context  I would like to draw attention to our initiative put forward at the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development  by reiterating our proposal to establish  within the framework of the United Nations  a register of global environmental problems. Such an instrument would help us to develop mechanisms for addressing environmental disasters.  By the 1990s  the Aral Sea  once a large inland sea  had lost three fourths of its water. That spelled disaster for millions of people living around it. The salt from the exposed seabed is being sprinkled on the entire Eurasian continent  damaging its environment. The countries of the Central Asian region have done much to rehabilitate the sea. However  without consolidation of the efforts of the world community  this problem cannot be solved. As I did at the 2002 Earth Summit  I again propose to give to the international fund to save the Aral Sea the status of a United Nations institution.  Secondly  a deepening global energy crisis and the growing threat of negative climate changes taking place on our planet present acute problems for the world community. We share the concern of the leaders of the Group of Eight (G-8) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries over these problems. It is advisable that we develop  within the framework of the United Nations  a global energy and environment strategy and discuss it at the 2012 World Summit on Sustainable Development.  Thirdly  Kazakhstan forms part of the Caspian region  which is playing a growing role in international energy markets. As of today  Kazakhstan has the world’s seventh largest reserves of oil  the sixth largest reserves of gas and the second largest deposits of uranium.  By 2017  Kazakhstan will be among the world’s 10 largest oil producers and exporters. Kazakhstan is also increasing its gas production. Possessing large deposits of uranium  we will be playing an important role in the development of the nuclear energy sector. That said  Kazakhstan is fully aware of its share of responsibility for ensuring a global energy balance and security.  To promote further diversification of energy delivery to consumers and also to provide assurances to energy producers  Kazakhstan proposes the adoption of a Eurasian pact on stability of energy delivery.  Fourthly  the first-ever global United Nations conference on problems faced by landlocked developing countries  hosted by Kazakhstan in 2003  adopted an international document  the Almaty Programme of Action. We believe that it will facilitate effective assistance to that group of countries. Decisions on the development of regional cooperation and transport and transit infrastructure adopted at the latest session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific  held in Kazakhstan last May  have become an important and logical step in the same direction.  Fifthly  speaking of Asia  we must mention here the issue of the establishment of a continental arrangement for collective security. That has become possible through the implementation of Kazakhstan’s initiative to convene the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA)  announced by me from this very podium  during the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly in 1992. Today  the CICA process brings together 18 States  which occupy 90 per cent of Asia’s territory. Their population makes up half of the people living on our planet. Time has proven the relevance of the CICA process  within which a political dialogue among Asian States is gaining momentum.  Sixthly  we support joint efforts to reform United Nations activities. In our view  the Security Council should be enlarged in the categories of both permanent and non-permanent members and on the basis of equitable geographical representation and respect for the sovereign equality of States. The working methods of the Security Council should also be reformed in order to increase its transparency and accountability. The General Assembly should play a central role as the main deliberative  decision-making and representative body of the United Nations.  Most of the sensational predictions of an inevitable “clash of civilizations ” fortunately  have not yet been accurate. However  we should be clear that interfaith tension feeds the social basis of international terrorism and religious extremism. I believe that seeking an accord between religions and the peaceful coexistence of ethnic groups is a crucially important element in the process of maintaining international security.  Kazakhstan  a home to 130 ethnic groups representing 45 religions  has set an example of tolerance  which has become a decisive factor in efforts to ensure peace  stability and the economic progress of Kazakhstan.  Conscious of the critical importance of a dialogue between world religions on key issues of the modern world order  Kazakhstan hosted  in 2003 and 2006  forums of leaders of world and traditional religions where religious opinion makers were trying to find not only a language of mutual understanding but also mechanisms for easing interfaith tensions in the planet’s hot spots.  I propose that the Third Congress of the Leaders of World and Traditional Religions  scheduled for 2009  be convened under the auspices of the United Nations. I also propose the proclamation of one of the coming years as an international year of convergence of cultures and religions.  Just days after the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001  Pope John Paul II visited our country. He said that that tragic event should not become a cause for confrontation between religions. I strongly believe that there are no problems in the world that cannot be solved if we set harmony  tolerance and spirituality against animosity  relying on mutual trust and cooperation. That understanding instils hope and enhances confidence in the future.  The United Nations plays a special role in the strengthening of those hopes. We are not sceptical about the legitimacy of international law and have faith in the effectiveness of such multilateral mechanisms as the United Nations in the promotion of security and fairness. We are against attempts to weaken our Organization. Kazakhstan associates itself with those States that are willing to strengthen the role and authority of the United Nations because they view it as the only international body capable of influencing  in an effective way  the issues of war and peace. "
"88",3708,"KEN",62,2007,"It is my very great pleasure to address the General Assembly. I join other speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. My delegation has every confidence in your ability to discharge this challenge. I assure you of our support.   I commend your predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for ably steering the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. I would also like to take this opportunity to once again congratulate the Secretary-General on his appointment. My delegation welcomes his commitment to strengthen the pillars of the United Nations: security  development and human rights.  Last year  when I had the privilege of addressing the Assembly  I dwelt on the issue of Somalia and how the dynamic in that country had an impact in our capitals and cities around the world  such as Toronto  Stockholm  Rome  Nairobi and Mogadishu. Even countries that are thousands of miles away and whose interaction with Somalia has been minimal have been forced to awaken to the reality that we have become a global village when their citizens plying international waters have been hijacked or robbed by pirates in the Indian Ocean along the coast of Somalia.  Let me thank the General Assembly and the Security Council for listening to our pleas from the region. I appeal for closer collaboration by the international community in addressing the complex and difficult problems of Somalia. Yet  within all these challenges  there are several windows of opportunity that we must take advantage of to prevent extreme human suffering  especially of women and children  in that sister country.  My delegation commends the African Union for its support for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). We pay special tribute to the Ugandan troops for the important role they are playing in Somalia under very trying circumstances. We appeal for the deployment of the remaining peacekeeping troops to strengthen AMISOM. Kenya also urges the United Nations to assume greater responsibility in Somalia in line with Security Council resolution 1772 (2007). A United Nations presence on the ground in Somalia would complement regional and international efforts to promote peace  stability and reconciliation in that country.  Kenya unequivocally supports national reconciliation in Somalia. We see it as a process  not a single event. We urge all the political actors that hitherto boycotted the talks to embrace the process  because  no matter how long it takes  the final resolution of the Somalia crisis will only come about when all Somalis agree to sit down and talk. The region and the international community can only provide support. Ultimately  it is the people of Somalia who can resolve their difference through a spirit of give and take. For our part  as the international community  we must honour our pledges to provide the necessary resources to Somalia. The problem with Somalia may be less visible today  probably because it has been overshadowed by the conflict in Darfur  but the Somalia crisis is far from over.  According to the Human Security Report 2005  the number of armed conflicts in the world has fallen by over 40 per cent during the past 13 years. The report’s overall conclusion that conflict is becoming less common in the world in general as well as in Africa is very encouraging. Conflict is a major disincentive to investment and poses an intolerable burden in terms of human suffering. The end of wars in Sierra Leone  Liberia  Côte d’Ivoire  Burundi  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Southern Sudan is a welcome development in Africa.  While we may celebrate the end of those wars  it is imperative that the international community make the urgent and essential investments that will contribute to the prevention of recurrence of such conflicts. The local populations should experience peace dividends so as to sustain peace.  Kenya urges a strengthening of partnerships between the African Union and the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the area of political and technical cooperation  as well as partnerships with the continent’s subregional organizations. The African Union’s peacekeeping capabilities and capacity must be strengthened through provision of financial  technical and logistical support. The recent deaths of many African Union soldiers in Darfur underline the urgency of the need for logistical support by the United Nations to African Union missions within the agreed-upon frameworks. In this regard  my delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s initiative to provide assistance to the African Union to enhance its military capabilities and mediation role in conflict resolution.  The United Nations has deployed a lot of time and resources in the area of disarmament and development. The proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons in the Horn of Africa continues to undermine our security and development. It has contributed to making our neighbourhood a very tough one.  In order to address this challenge  the States of the region rallied together in 2000 to sign the Nairobi Declaration on the Problem of the Proliferation of Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons in the Great Lakes Region and the Horn of Africa. The Declaration was upgraded in 2004 to a legally binding Protocol  the first intergovernmental instrument of its kind to address the proliferation of small arms. In 2005  the Protocol established the Regional Centre on Small Arms and Light Weapons (RECSA)  with the main objective of providing a comprehensive framework to combat the availability of illicit small arms and light weapons in the region. In view of the importance of the Centre  Kenya has requested the inclusion of an item in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly to invite RECSA to participate in the work of the Assembly as an observer. Addressing the problem of the proliferation of small arms is important; we are up against the very powerful international vested interests of small arms manufacturers and traders.  Kenya was among the six sponsors of the draft resolution on the arms trade treaty that was overwhelmingly adopted during the last session of the General Assembly as resolution 61/89. In that resolution  the General Assembly requested that the Secretary-General  among other things  seek the views of Member States on the feasibility  scope and draft parameters for a legally binding arms trade treaty. We commend the Secretary-General for the progress made so far in the implementation of that resolution. We look forward to the establishment of a group of Governmental experts to begin work next year and to the group’s report to the General Assembly at its next session.   I recently had occasion to address a group of my fellow Foreign Ministers from our close neighbour  Europe  on a couple of subjects that increasingly define our relationship with the rest of the world  among them illegal immigration. It is one of the ironies of history that there was a time when my brothers and sisters who were unlucky and could not run fast enough were caught as slaves and shipped across the oceans in very inhuman conditions. A large number died during the journey as they were sent to different parts of the world to provide slave labour.  Today  many of my brothers and sisters are often voluntarily offering themselves and handing over their life savings to be shipped across oceans in almost similar inhuman conditions. Many of them have lost their lives during the journey. They play cat and mouse  attempting to avoid border patrols equipped with tracer dogs and electronic monitoring  so as to get a chance to slave most of their lives in the minimum-wage bracket.  The clock has ticked full circle. But a lot has changed as well. And I come back to my assertion that distances between us have shrunk and we must now recognize that  in this global village  a phenomenon such as economic refugees is going to be a cause of trauma in our communities. You can build great walls  introduce and increase more menacing border patrols and make your immigration meaner  but the respite can only be temporary. You can whip up xenophobic sentiment  especially around national election times. But that amounts to an ineffectual Band-Aid and does not address the fundamentals of the crisis we are facing today.  Even in the most developed countries  unless a society addresses the problems and stress in the poor neighbourhoods and inner cities  any solution like migration into the suburbs and the construction of gated communities will only provide some temporary relief. Crime will continue unabated. Muggings  carjackings  kidnappings and other violent crime will continue to prevail. We have to address the fundamental problems in our poor neighbourhoods not just for the sake of those living in those neighbourhoods but also for the sake of those who live in relatively affluent areas.  What I am talking about is not really rocket science or some very complex social engineering concept. It should be clear to all of us that  in the global village that we have come to be  it is in the interest of all of us to work together to address the conspiracy of factors that create so much stress and tension within and among our countries. We must be level-headed enough to recognize that angry unemployed young men in one country will spill over sooner or later into other countries’ capitals and create problems.  If nothing else  the phenomenon of global climate change should teach us the lesson that our destinies as human beings are inextricably intertwined. Vehicular emissions in New York do the same thing to our village Earth as our cutting of equatorial forests in Africa to make charcoal. Both actions may introduce incidents of floods due climate change all the way over in distant China.  As neighbours in the global village  it is certainly a good thing if we both come to recognize that if wealthy countries’ policies and actions confine us to abject poverty  then it is only a matter of time before the stress in my country will spill over into their neighbourhood   maybe in the form of illegal immigration  terrorism or whatever. However  sooner or later we all have to pay for the consequences of selfish and short-sighted policies of the World Trade Organization (WTO)  the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.  It is therefore important that as we talk about reform and paradigm shifts in any of these international institutions we should adopt the right attitude: that nobody is doing the other a favour. We are in this small boat called Earth together. When the powerful think that they are playing their advantage in the global scene and winning the battles  such victory can only be temporary. The only real victory is when it is a win-win outcome. The other outcome  when a large part of the world emerges as losers  is unsustainable. It breeds anger and vengeance.  Most of the resources and capacity to change our world for the better are domiciled in the developed world. The resources needed are more than enough in the more endowed countries. The knowledge of what we must do to make a positive difference is simple and evident. Yet as world leaders we must bear the collective guilt of failing to focus on providing the solutions.  I come from a country in a region  for example  where factors such as poverty and lack of education conspire to stress and destabilize our communities and countries. There is an autocatalytic relationship between poverty and low education. Those who have low education tend to become poorer. And those who are poorer tend to have low education. There is also a correlation between poverty and low formal education  on one side  and inter-ethnic  clan  religious and even racial tension  on the other side. This invariably leads to unstable societies.  When people are poor and less educated  their reference point tends to become only their ethnic  clan  religious or racial identity. With a few exceptions  the educated and affluent are at least able to operate at a higher level. A doctor  a lawyer  a teacher or an engineer is usually less xenophobic.  In Kenya  we understand this  and therefore we understand the importance of education. We have invested up to 30 per cent of our annual budget to provide free primary education. Next year  we will have free secondary education. That is the type of social and economic investment we all must make now if we expect to have a better  more prosperous and more stable world 10 years from now. We may make fine speeches and express a commitment to creating a safer  friendlier and more prosperous world. But as long as we fail to make the right investment in education and poverty alleviation  we are only engaged in empty talk.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are important medium- and long-term goals   10 years in scope  usually. However  our democracies operate on a shorter calendar of four or five years. In both the developed and the less developed countries  many of the leaders tend to do what they must to survive and succeed in the next elections. Even with best of intentions  the nature and scope of the challenges of development that we must address cannot be adequately solved with official development assistance (ODA) programmes that are implemented and completed within the political calendar of changing regimes. We need more paradigm shifts and a longer-term vision in that regard.  In conclusion  many of our countries are now crashing under the weight of international debt. Those who have actually crashed are the ones that have been extended a parachute after they have crashed. I am amazed by this undertaker mentality.  I do not wish to blame the current generation of leaders in the developed countries for the status quo. I know that there is some financial and economic principle here. Most of the current leaders in these countries are innocent. The deals that were cut in the past  which put us in the kind of debt we are in today  are no longer in place. But I feel I must say that the load and the burden of our international debt is heavy and debilitating. A lot of it should not have been undertaken on in the first place; there is some complicity in the dishonesty on both sides that prevailed before we  today’s leaders  came onto the scene.  It is important that today we secure the future of all our children  who must share this increasingly intertwined world. We must put behind us those negative things  such as the unjustified debts of the past  that can only breed anger and bitterness and affect future generations. We must make the sacrifices and the investment today for the future of humanity. That would be a favour to all of us  and not just to one group. "
"89",3732,"KGZ",62,2007,"At the outset  let me join others in congratulating Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I assure him that the delegation of Kyrgyzstan stands ready to cooperate with him. On behalf of my delegation I wish him every success in fulfilling his responsibilities.  I wish to pay tribute to Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her outstanding stewardship during the previous session of the General Assembly.  I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his election to his high and responsible post and to wish him every success in his important work. I am confident that his vast experience and diplomatic skill will enable him to achieve all the goals of the United Nations.  It would no doubt be difficult to come to a common agreement about the date on which the new millennium began   whether it started with the tragedy of 2001 or harks back to 1991  when the structure of the world order changed. I believe that the proponents of either theory would agree that a new period has emerged: a time when the interdependence of States has become a vivid reality leading to greater vulnerability. Problems have become global  whereas globalization has become localized.  In the face of all these dilemmas  the United Nations unswervingly maintains its status as an organization whose core value is to promote the moral principles of solidarity. The formation of a global civil society and the recognition of universally accepted rights and freedoms under the auspices of the United Nations play a significant role in furthering the process of consolidation.  This clearly shows that society is capable of refraining from war and solving its problems by using its peacekeeping potential. Thoughtfully building the future is not possible without reviewing and continuing strategic planning of socio-economic development. Fifteen years ago  one of the most noteworthy of United Nations conferences took place at Rio de Janeiro. There  the concept of sustainable development was defined as a new tenet for humankind. The main purpose was to create a new mechanism enabling us to resolve existing social tensions and to prevent future ones through cooperation among States and the formation of a global civil society.  The relationship between the State and the society develops differently in each country. The Kyrgyz Republic has come a long way in affirming democratic values  conducting constitutional reform and fiscal decentralization. All this has been reflected in the national development strategy approved by the President of the Kyrgyz Republic  Mr. Kurmanbek Bakiev. The aim of that document is to achieve sustainable development by 2010; it is based on the principles of self-fulfilment and human security  which are the basic source of positive change in the sphere of human development.  At the same time  we are well aware that long-term sustainable development depends on the stability of human relationships based on an understanding of how to use existing resources for social and economic development today and of what we must leave for future generations.  Seven years ago  the General Assembly adopted the Millennium Development Goals  thereby defining our objectives for the future and the conditions needed to achieve them. Attainment of the eight Goals and tackling of the 15 challenges will serve as a basis both for our global initiative and for realizing the potential of regional development.  Nevertheless  level of development varies from region to region. This is particularly relevant for mountainous regions  which require a different strategy for sustainable development which takes into account each area’s specific potential in natural resources. In addition to defining the ecological parameters  it is necessary to define the economic and geographic peculiarities of mountainous regions that call for a special system of management which would give priority to local self-governance. Despite their significant resource potential  mountainous territories need to address as a priority problems related to living standards and quality of life. In that regard  the Kyrgyz Republic believes that a second Global Mountain Summit should be convened  at which we could formulate a definitive sustainable policy for mountainous regions  along with relevant norms of international law.  Even what is seemingly the most insignificant social inequality can destroy the social integrity of humankind. Similarly  equal protection of rights and freedoms and the adoption of universal values of respect for human life enable us to fulfil the principles of the Seville Statement Violence  which defines war as a product of human culture.  The primary source of conflict is  in fact  lack of social responsibility. The development strategy of every single country should establish social responsibility as a basic characteristic for elaborating approaches to regional and global coordination  thus improving the environment and reducing energy shortages. Regional parameters of responsibility will then create a new type of society  which will be no longer a society at risk  but rather a society of security.  I have no doubt that all of today’s participants  as well as all countries that accepted the MDGs as a basis for their national development  are striving to establish social peace and social equality  but the establishment of a socially-oriented world order requires the strengthening of mechanisms to promote the adoption of decisions at the highest level. It is necessary that such mechanisms include both the monitoring of joint efforts and parameters of progress achieved in the framework of the most effective implementation of the MDGs. The initiative of the Kyrgyz President to proclaim 20 February a world day of social justice would serve as such a mechanism. We kindly request the General Assembly to consider adopting a resolution to that effect at the current session.  The establishment of social justice has been a dream of humankind for many millennia. There was a time when some were burned at the stake for entertaining such dreams or attempting to establish a community of social justice. At one time  dictatorship and authoritarianism prospered under the pretext of a call to social justice. That happened because of a disparity between the proclaimed elevated goals and the means of their achievement.  In the third millennium  the world’s nations have defined development goals in the framework of a united society. The means to achieve those goals must correspond to a high level of civic awareness of the potential of peacekeeping. We already have the grounds for a constructive dialogue defining the dynamics of peacekeeping for humankind’s development. The United Nations has been a foundation of such dialogue for several decades.  Allow me from this rostrum to confirm the adherence of the Kyrgyz Republic to the goals and purposes of the United Nations to maintain peace  security and a prosperous life for all the nations of the Earth.

"90",3775,"KHM",62,2007,"First of all  I wish to warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Kerim of the Republic of Macedonia for his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am confident that  under his able guidance  this year’s session will be concluded with success. My appreciation also goes to Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain for her brilliant leadership as the President of the sixty-first session  which produced significant achievements during the past year.  I am also very delighted to express my most cordial felicitations to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his appointment as the United Nations Secretary-General. I have no doubt that under his wise leadership our world body will certainly become even more relevant and effective in responding to the challenges facing us in the twenty-first century.  Today  the world continues to confront a myriad of problems  ranging from peace and security to development  such as terrorism  regional conflicts  poverty  global warming  pandemic diseases  and so forth. These old and new emerging crises are indeed of global proportion  which require greater collective efforts by the world community. Therefore  as United Nations Member States  we have to share the common responsibility to address these issues more effectively for the sake of humanity.  Concerning weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)  it is imperative that all States fully comply with the existing non-proliferation legal instruments in order to build a better and safer world for all  particularly the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty  which laid down a long-term perspective toward achieving a non-proliferation regime for WMDs and preventing them from falling into terrorist hands  which could trigger the gravest of dangers to the international community.  Combating terrorism remains one of the top priorities for all Governments. No single country can deal with this unconventional threat without cooperation and concerted efforts  which should be further strengthened  particularly in the areas of education and information-sharing among law enforcement authorities and intelligence agencies.  In terms of security  we certainly cannot underestimate the illegal use and circulation of small arms and light weapons  as they can be an equally dangerous source of terrorism  violence and regional conflicts. In this context  Cambodia believes that the 2001 United Nations Programme of Action on Small Arms should remain the cornerstone for us all to work together to address this issue. In Cambodia  the Royal Government has developed a number of programmes  ranging from law enforcement on arms control to a programme of weapons for development  which has successfully led to the seizure and destruction of more than 200 000 small arms and light weapons.  Likewise  landmines still remain a serious threat to many nations in the developing world  especially those facing armed conflicts as well as those emerging from war. These “silent killers” have destroyed the lives of many innocent peoples and maimed countless others. Landmines are not only a security problem  but a humanitarian one  as the victims become permanently traumatized and physically handicapped  while their families suffer untold misery and spiritual and material deprivation. Landmines also have great impact on the economy and development  as the victims constitute a heavy economic and social burden for governments.  In Cambodia  the Royal Government is continuing its campaign of mine clearance by placing the demining operation in its national agenda  such as the Cambodian Millennium Development Goals and its “Rectangular Strategy”. By July this year  more than 1.5 million landmines had been cleared. To share our own experiences with other countries that are also victims of landmines  Cambodia has dispatched 135 deminers of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces to Sudan for demining action under the umbrella of the United Nations peacekeeping operation.  Everyone nowadays recognizes that climate change has become one of the most serious threats to humanity and affects the whole world in this new century. To reverse this negative megatrend  Cambodia is of the view that all countries should effectively implement the relevant United Nations instruments  especially the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. We also call on countries that produce more greenhouse gases to commit to gradually reducing their emissions as much as possible.   At the same time  we need to develop and share know-how on bioenergy in order to take measures against global warming. In addition  we need to stop the deforestation in the developing countries by assisting them with appropriate measures and resources.  In the framework of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  our leaders will sign three important documents related to climate change  energy and environment during the coming ASEAN Summit in November of this year in Singapore. The signing of these declarations clearly reflects the political commitments that ASEAN  both collectively and individually  has attached to the issues of climate change.  Cambodia highly appreciates the United Nations initiative of convening the High-level Event on Climate Change here in New York on 24 September this year. We hope that that high-level meeting will lead to significant and concrete actions to address opportunely this very critical issue. However  I believe that a world summit under the auspices of the United Nations would keep climate change alive on the agenda of world’s leaders. A global problem needs a global solution.  With regard to the regional situation  Cambodia welcomes the agreement reached in February this year through the process of the six party talks leading to the closing down of the nuclear facilities in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. This is a very positive step for peace  security and stability in the region. We hope that it will serve as an effective tool to pave the way for complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  Concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  we applaud recent active diplomatic initiatives  in particular the high-level talks between the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian Authority. We hope that those meetings and activities will lead to a definitive solution that establishes a State of Palestine  coexisting permanently and peacefully side by side with Israel  in order to end the killing and suffering of their peoples and for the sake of peace and security in the region.  With regard to the current appalling situation in Iraq  we applaud the recent decision of the United States to sizeably reduce the number of its troops in the country. However  the final and decisive solution will depend on how the Iraqi people reconcile among themselves. That is a sine qua non for ending the civil war in the country. Otherwise  I fear that chaos will ensue after the withdrawal of United States troops.  In the light of our own experience  I believe that the only option that will bring peace and stability to Iraq is national reconciliation  with a win-win policy for Shiites and Sunnis. But the main question that we should ponder is: who or which country can contribute to the initial process of confidence-building before any genuine reconciliation can be achieved?  This year marks the halfway point between the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in September 2000 and the target date of 2015. Notwithstanding some overall progress  developing countries have been experiencing difficulties in meeting the MDG targets. This is despite the outcomes of the many high-level meetings that have been taking place throughout the world aimed at improving economic development and the livelihoods of peoples in developing countries  such as the Monterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. In reality  however  the situation of developing countries has not improved much. What we need now is strong commitment and political will on the part of all  in particular those in the developed world  to ensure that globalization will be a globalization of wealth for all peoples living on this planet. I hope that that is not just a dream  but a goal for all.  The Royal Government of Cambodia has come up with its own MDGs  in addition to the rectangular strategy and the national strategic development plan 2006-2010  to work to achieve sustainable development and poverty reduction. The carrying out of those national blueprints has yielded strong economic growth that has averaged more than 11 per cent over the past three years.   Therefore  at the Annual Ministerial Review of the Economic and Social Council  held in Geneva in July of this year  Cambodia was invited  together with five other countries  to make a national presentation on actual progress made in achieving our MDGs.   Concerning our Organization  the United Nations  we are more than ever convinced of the urgent need for comprehensive reform   and not just of the Security Council   because we need to mobilize our collective efforts and wisdom to address  in a responsive and comprehensive way  the problems we are facing in the twenty-first century.  There is no doubt that the status quo does not correspond with the challenges confronting the world today. Cambodia is of the view that United Nations reform must be comprehensive. Therefore  instead of focusing primarily on reform of the Security Council  perhaps we can start with reform that can garner a consensus. For example  we could begin by considering how to make the Economic and Social Council more effective and more relevant so that it can deal with the problems of development in the context of the MDGs. Then  of course  we also need to empower the General Assembly so that it can play a prominent role in addressing today’s global problems as a democratic  deliberative  policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations. Next  having built up momentum and consensus by reforming both the Economic and Social Council and the Assembly  we could move on to reform of the Security Council to ensure that it reflects today’s realities  with equitable representation for developed and developing countries.  To conclude  I would like to say that our world is currently facing serious threats of great proportion and severe regional crises. At the same time  development and poverty remain high on the agendas of countries in many parts of the world. Therefore  the United Nations must play a more leading role if it is to respond effectively to those challenges. "
"91",3789,"KIR",62,2007,"I bring warm greetings from my Government and the people of the Republic of Kiribati  on whose behalf I am honoured and privileged to address this important gathering this afternoon.  Allow me to join preceding speakers in offering my sincere congratulations to Mr. Kerim on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am confident that with his wisdom  experience and diplomatic skill  he will steer the course of this Assembly to a successful conclusion. Let me assure him that Kiribati pledges its full support to him in the performance of his challenging task.  I take this opportunity to also extend my appreciation to his predecessor for the exemplary way in which she guided the proceedings of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  I wish to commend as well the Secretary-General and members of his team in the Secretariat for their perseverance and relentless efforts in pursuit of the goals of the United Nations. In particular  I congratulate the Secretary-General on his sterling leadership of this Organization since taking over his top and challenging job at the beginning of this year. Our world is confronted more than ever with a number of serious threats and major challenges. Every year  we all come together from different parts of the world to this beautiful city of New York with our hopes of finding practical and workable solutions to those challenges. Indeed  situations in some regions of the world show no sign of improvement and are further confronted by crises that have proven difficult to settle. Those challenges affect us each as individual countries  small and big  rich and poor  developing and developed. In a world characterized by globalization and interdependence  the need for the human family to undertake constructive and sustained cooperation has become more urgent.  With the growing complexity and uncertainty of events in this world of ours  especially in the context of globalization and with the emergence of new challenges to peace and security  the fulfilment of the role of the United Nations remains critical. Kiribati remains committed to supporting the reform of the United Nations.  We continue to believe that the reform of this Organization is in the best interests of humanity  and we would like to see the reform processes move forward and be concluded as early as practicable in order for the Organization to be able to respond effectively to today’s challenges to global peace  security and economic and social progress.  Seeking peace and economic development represents the common wish of all nations. Without global peace there can be little positive development in our countries. Kiribati is committed  within its resource and capacity constraints  to working closely with other like-minded countries in pursuit of world peace and stability  economic development and progress of mankind. As the only universal multilateral international organization  the United Nations remains the best forum for allowing all States to come together to resolve problems of a global character  regardless of their size or wealth.  States Members of the United Nations are all too aware that globalization has brought us all to a point at which everything is interconnected and the well-being of almost every citizen is affected by global developments. Events that happen in one part of the world have a direct bearing on the rest of the world.  Sometimes however  we are all affected and involved in a much more substantial way. Like other least developed countries and small island developing States  Kiribati has so many constraints. Our very remoteness from world market centres  narrow economic base and high population growth rates are factors that we must contend with. The continuing sharp increase in world oil prices and our total reliance on imported oil and fossil fuel has already put a lot of pressure on our economy. Our options for containing the adverse impact of increasing world oil prices are very limited. We must also contend with the HIV/AIDS pandemic and tuberculosis  among others  which require the diversion of the already meagre resources we have at our disposal to finance our development.  Those complex economic situations of ours will continue to undermine our efforts and determination to realize the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals. In order to be able to realize our aspirations to attaining sustainable economic development and to sharing the benefits of globalization  Kiribati would like to call on the international community to look at a new global strategy that would create an enabling economic environment for the most disadvantaged States Members of this noble institution  such as my own.  Even with those complex economic development challenges  we are forced to operate in an environment of uncertainty. I say “uncertainty” as our very survival as a nation and as a people with a distinct culture and way of life is at great risk  as we are being threatened by global warming and sea-level rise.  Our islands are widely dispersed and small; most rise barely over 0.2 metres above mean sea level. For countries such as Kiribati  global warming and sea-level rise are critical security concerns. Those concerns are ones that we  as individual countries and as members of this collective body  need to continue to work together to address.  We will continue to call on the international community to agree on a unified global response to those environment issues. We will also continue to work with like-minded countries in pushing the case for a unified global response to those issues. As a small country  Kiribati places great confidence on the international community for its survival  and we hope that our repeated appeals to this body to address that critical issue will receive stronger political support and commitment this time. There is no more time to debate the issue  as climate change is now a fact of life. It is now time to put words into action so that this living planet is protected from complete destruction and preserved for use by our many generations to come.  We wish to commend the Secretary-General for his initiative in calling the high-level event on climate change on 24 September this year. That in itself means a lot to those who are now living under the cloud of desperation  fear and uncertainty. We remain confident that further meaningful actions will follow and that consensus will soon be achieved on finding a global solution to climate change before it is too late.  Terrorism is an ongoing concern that affects all countries large and small. Kiribati condemns terrorism in all its various forms and manifestations and will continue to support the global fight against terrorism.  This time last year  Kiribati joined other States Members of the United Nations in expressing our disappointment over the continued neglect and rejection of the desire of the 23 million people of Taiwan to join this Organization. It is further saddening to note that Taiwan’s request for admission this year was again not given a fair opportunity to be heard by the General Assembly.  With a population of 23 million  giving it the forty-seventh largest population in the world  Taiwan has continued to respect and abide by the United Nations Charter based on the principles of democracy  mutual respect and understanding. We feel that Taiwan and its 23 million people deserve justice from this noble institution. It is Kiribati’s fervent hope that Taiwan will one day be given the nod to assume its rightful place in this highly respected Organization.  Let us all work together to make this world a better place   a place where citizens of all of our nations can live together in harmony  peace  security and prosperity for many years to come. "
"92",3820,"KNA",62,2007,"I have the  honour to address the General Assembly at its sixty-second session on behalf of the Government and people of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.  I extend heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kerim and his country  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I assure him of my delegation’s full cooperation as he endeavours to chart the course of positive interaction and coordination in this international arena.  I would also like to welcome the new Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who is assisting at his first general debate of the General Assembly as Secretary-General. My delegation supports him in his all-too-important task of managing the affairs of the United Nations.  Small island developing States such as Saint Kitts and Nevis rely on the United Nations to level the playing field in international discourse so that we can interact  contribute and benefit on an equal footing with other members of the international community.  Twenty-four years ago  Saint Kitts and Nevis took the bold step of joining this body. We pledged then to do all in our power to pursue peace  security  human rights and development. Twenty-four years later  my beautiful country can boast that it has kept faith with our people and the international community. It has achieved much  and the pace and nature of its development set an example for other small island developing States.  Today  the human development index of the United Nations Development Programme ranks us fifty-first out of 177 countries evaluated in the world. Saint Kitts and Nevis has indices on per capita gross domestic product  health and educational enrolment comparable to those of many in the developed world. Pleased as we are with our progress  we are all too aware that the journey is not yet ended. Much work needs to be done. Poverty in our Federation and in the Caribbean is still at an unacceptable level  and the turbulence of the global climate vitiates our continuing development.  We are almost at the mid-point of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). If we were to evaluate ourselves as a whole  we would have to acknowledge that many of the commitments have not been met. Aid has fallen off  official development assistance has been limited  and we have seen competing initiatives divert the drive of fulfilling the MDGs. Today  Saint Kitts and Nevis calls upon all States  be they in the North  South  East or West  developed or developing  to do all in their power to ensure the realization of the fruits of our united vision that proposed the Millennium Development Goals.  United Nations Member States are not all equal in endowments. Those that have more resources must allocate more to the global development agenda. The developed world must meet its financing commitments  as agreed at the Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development. That Conference represents a landmark because  for the first time  the developed world agreed that we were jointly responsible for development and that it had a special role in financing for development. That commitment  regrettably  has not been matched by real resources.  The United Nations will hold a follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development. The State of Qatar has generously offered to host that meeting. We applaud that country for its commitment to the cause and we again call upon all countries to implement the commitments they made at Monterrey.   Saint Kitts and Nevis acknowledges that the HIV/AIDS pandemic constitutes a threat to our development and  indeed  our security. Prime Minister Denzil Douglas  in his capacity as Caribbean lead spokesman for health and human and social development has often stated that this matter requires serious and dedicated monitoring and action.   The fight to eradicate the scourge of HIV/AIDS must continue  and we must dedicate ourselves to that task. No matter the merits and demerits of the debate concerning issues in relation to intellectual property rights  the evidence has shown that only with cheaper antiretroviral drugs can the HIV/AIDS pandemic at the minimum be managed and its threat to humankind reduced. Therefore  there is a need to address the issues related to the cost of these drugs so that they can be available to all who need them.  The book of Genesis reminds us that man was made to coexist peacefully with his environment. The planet Earth is not an inheritance; rather  it is a loan from our children and grandchildren  who hope that one day we will return to them a clean and wholesome Earth. We must be careful  then  that our production and consumption patterns and behaviours do not surpass the environment’s capacity to sustain them.  The matter of climate change is of continuing and great interest to my Government. Indeed  we view the associated problems of the high frequency of abnormal weather  sea level rise  global warming and coastal degradation as matters affecting the economic and environmental security of small States such as Saint Kitts and Nevis. We are indeed heartened by the priority being accorded to this matter by the new Secretary-General.  This year  Saint Kitts and Nevis signed the Kyoto Protocol  which signalled my country’s commitment to doing all that it can to reduce its carbon emissions. We urge other States to sign the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.  Indeed  Saint Kitts and Nevis will never shirk its responsibilities as a global citizen. We believe that global environmental management and multinational efforts could resolve many issues   particularly at this time  when all of us have experienced environmental deterioration. We call on developed countries to provide greater support to small island developing States in combating the adverse effects of climate change. In addition  we urge far greater South-South cooperation on the important matter of climate change.  We live at a time when disasters are occurring with a rapidity not previously felt. Within CARICOM  we felt the impact of the passage of Hurricane Dean  during which lives were lost  livelihoods were threatened and  in the case of Jamaica  an election was postponed. That same hurricane moved on to wreak havoc in Mexico and was followed very closely by other  equally destructive hurricanes.  Over the past year  nearly every region of the world has endured some form of natural or man-made disaster. My delegation believes  therefore  that we need an increase in humanitarian and disaster relief assistance. No country escapes the need for such assistance. In addition to supporting the existence and the role of the Central Emergency Response Fund  we encourage Member States to commit to that and similar initiatives.  I now turn to United Nations reform. During the course of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly  the issue of reform of the United Nations and  in particular  system-wide coherence received extensive attention. Saint Kitts and Nevis believes that reform is necessary. My delegation’s position  therefore  is that the time has come for agreement on the issue and on the way forward. We need continued dialogue  of course. But  most important  Member States need to agree on a plan of action and its implementation  as well as on the need to get on with the job. If we do not agree  or if we remain inflexible regarding one another’s concerns  we will all be at a disadvantage. Therefore  the dialogue among civilizations must continue  and implementation must occur  if true reform of all aspects of the United Nations is to come to fruition.  The United Nations must remain open to membership for all States. In that regard  experience has shown that United Nations membership is not a deterrent to unification; consider  for example  the former East Germany and West Germany. Nor is it a panacea for fragmentation  as some have argued  citing the deconstruction of the former Soviet Union. What has always been clear is that the United Nations has extended a warm welcome to all States and respected the equality of all States.  In the context of the principle of universality  my country renews its call for Taiwan to become a Member of the United Nations. It is of grave concern that the 23 million people of Taiwan have been denied the right to participate in the United Nations and its related bodies. During the sixty-first session  that exclusion and isolation were pursued even more aggressively.   We  the friends of Taiwan  implore the United Nations family to recognize that the people of Taiwan are a disenfranchised people. Many of us were once also disenfranchised and unrepresented; but  through international recognition of our inalienable right to participate  we are here today. My delegation wishes to see the same right enjoyed by the people of Taiwan.  Taiwan has shown that it can be a true partner in development. In our view  the international community has been deprived of the gift of that partnership at a time when Taiwan’s assistance could have been so useful to many States in meeting the Millennium Development Goals.  In March of this year  the United Nations observed the bicentenary of the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. My Prime Minister  the Honourable Mr. Denzil Douglas  had the distinct honour of addressing this body on behalf of CARICOM. One of the significant results of the commemoration exercise has been an acknowledgement that the injustice of slavery still exists in one form or another and that there is a need to address that problem. Child slavery and economic slavery impact the societies of the international community  and we need to mobilize our collective resources to combat those scourges. Only when that has been accomplished will we be able to feel that the battle waged more than 200 years ago to abolish the trans-Atlantic slave trade and all elements associated with it has been won.  Finally  as we look ahead to the rest of the sixty-second session  I wish to reiterate my country’s pledge of cooperation  commitment and dialogue to address the many challenges that we will encounter in ensuring that the United Nations remains the relevant forum for international relations. The United Nations must continue to be a beacon of hope for countries in search of peace  self-determination  respect for human rights  progress  development and  very important  justice. It is not too late for this body to go and enchant the world. "
"93",3846,"KOR",62,2007,"I  should like first to offer my warmest congratulations to you  Mr. Kerim  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am confident that under your distinguished leadership we will achieve great results during this important session. I take this opportunity to assure you of the Republic of Korea’s full support for your noble endeavours.   I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his excellent service during his first year in office. Based on long experience of working closely with him  His Excellency President Roh Moo-hyun of the Republic of Korea and I have every confidence that he will continue to fulfil his role with distinction.  Today’s global challenges require a collective response. Ever-widening globalization has brought with it a growing role for the United Nations. By virtue of its universality  the United Nations is the right body to deal with these global issues. No other organization can provide the legitimacy and authority that the United Nations offers. The United Nations has played an indispensable role in setting international norms and principles. It has pointed States and peoples in the right direction. By enhancing predictability and rule-based interaction between and among nations  the United Nations is able to prevent conflicts of interest from erupting into crises. Those are the quiet successes of the United Nations that often go unnoticed  precisely because the Organization helps to keep the international system running smoothly. This aspect of the work of the United Nations deserves full recognition and should be further strengthened.   At the same time  the United Nations can do better. We should persist in our efforts to strengthen the world body through reform. This will be essential in enabling the United Nations to respond effectively to the most daunting challenges of our era. As steps towards achieving that end  the Government of the Republic of Korea fully supports the important initiatives that the Secretary-General has taken to promote the efficiency  effectiveness and accountability of the Secretariat. In particular  we appreciate his strenuous efforts to lead by example in changing the Secretariat’s working culture.  Development  human rights and peace and security are the three pillars of the United Nations. They are all imperatives  and they are mutually reinforcing. Let me begin with development. The Millennium Development Goals agreed upon by our leaders in 2000 have a target year of 2015. We are already at the midpoint. It is essential that we assess the current situation and renew our commitment. But such actions will not be enough on their own. We need to identify more effective means to fulfil those commitments.   The Republic of Korea has been redoubling its efforts to enhance its official development assistance (ODA). We have committed ourselves to a threefold increase by 2015 from our current ODA level. To further support the international effort to eradicate poverty  we have joined the air-ticket solidarity levy initiative  an innovative source of financing for development. At the same time  drawing lessons from our own history of development  we place emphasis not only on increasing the scale of our aid but also on effectively sharing our experience with developing countries.  An issue closely related to development is climate change. There is a growing consensus that climate change is placing serious constraints on worldwide development capacity. It affects everyone everywhere. Therefore it must be urgently addressed. I hope that the political will shown by the leaders of more than 150 nations at the gathering held here on Monday  24 September  leads to the adoption of a road map to a post-2012 regime of realistic  tangible solutions to this pressing concern. They should be comprehensive and flexible enough to ensure participation by as many countries as possible.  Turning to human rights  it is vital that the Human Rights Council live up to the high expectations that surrounded its creation. We must do all we can to enable the Council to make real progress in the promotion of human rights. Let us renew our commitment and strengthen our joint efforts to ensure its success. As an inaugural member of the Council  the Republic of Korea is fully committed to the principle of all human rights for all.   In that regard my Government is deeply concerned about the current situation in Myanmar and the loss of civilian lives during the continuing protests. We strongly hope that the Government and the people of Myanmar will work together peacefully towards democratization and national reconciliation.   My Government has substantially increased its efforts to eliminate discrimination against vulnerable groups such as women  children and persons with disabilities. We have vigorously pushed for necessary legislation and the improvement of institutional frameworks to protect and promote the rights of such individuals. Also  we adopted a national action plan for the promotion and protection of human rights in May this year.  In the area of peace and security  United Nations peacekeeping missions are continuing to grow in importance as well as in the size and scope of their activities. The strengthened United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  operating in southern Lebanon  and the deployment of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur are two prominent examples.  Indeed  the rising demand for peacekeeping and the broad support of the international community are clear evidence of the crucial role of the United Nations in maintaining peace and security. For our part  the Republic of Korea’s recent participation in UNIFIL testifies once again to our firm commitment to United Nations peacekeeping activities. We will make every effort to enable our well-trained and disciplined Korean contingents to contribute further to peacekeeping activities.   Peace cannot be sustained without development. A comprehensive approach is required in order to make the fragile peace of post-conflict situations durable and irreversible. With the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  the critical task of consolidating peace and development has been institutionalized. In that regard  I believe that the experience of the Republic of Korea over the past half century in rebuilding the nation from the ashes of war since the 1950s could provide useful insights and encouragements that might help the post-conflict peacebuilding activities of the United Nations.  Terrorism continues to be one of the gravest challenges of our times. The Republic of Korea strongly condemns terrorism in all forms  committed by whomever  wherever and for whatever purpose. We fully support the ongoing global anti-terrorism efforts. The Republic of Korea is party to 12 existing anti-terrorism conventions  while being in the process of ratifying the latest International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. We are also of the view that the United Nations should lose no more time in concluding a comprehensive convention on terrorism.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and their delivery systems poses an ever-increasing threat to the international community. To curb WMD proliferation  our highest priority must be to restore the integrity and relevance of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. In fact the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) regime is at a crossroads. It has faced unprecedented challenges in recent years. In responding to those challenges we need to pool our wisdom to strengthen the current nuclear non-proliferation regime. The inherent deficiencies in the NPT should be remedied  and effective multilateral tools should be further developed to better serve the purposes of both nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.   As home to the world’s sixth-largest civil nuclear energy industry  the Republic of Korea regards the peaceful use of nuclear energy as crucial to our sustainable energy supply and economic development. That is all the more reason why we support strengthened safeguards against possible proliferation as a guarantee of the expanded use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  Among the proliferation challenges facing the international community  the nuclear issue of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea requires our immediate attention. That problem  if not resolved soon  will seriously undermine the NPT regime. It also has significant implications for peace and security in North-East Asia and beyond. The Six-Party Talks are the main vehicle through which to resolve the nuclear issue of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. That process has made significant progress since its launch in 2003. In the Joint Statement of September 2005  the six nations agreed on a blueprint for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The Agreement on Initial Actions  of February this year  took that consensus another step forward  laying out specific actions to implement the Joint Statement. We hope that another agreement will be reached during the new round of the Six-Party Talks now under way in Beijing  leading to the disabling of the nuclear facilities of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  On the Korean peninsula  inter-Korean relations will be taken to a higher level with the summit meeting to be held in Pyongyang next week between President Roh Moo-hyun and Chairman Kim Jong-il. The summit will first of all aim at consolidating peace on the Korean peninsula. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will be encouraged to move forward on the path to denuclearization. In the same vein  the leaders will explore ways to increase mutual trust through political and military confidence-building measures  as well as ways to lay the groundwork for an eventual inter-Korean economic community. With progress in the denuclearization process  a new peace regime will be established on the Korean peninsula to replace the half-century-old armistice. The deepening of inter-Korean relations and the improvement of ties between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and other countries concerned will warrant such a change.   The resolution of the nuclear issue of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will thus have a ripple effect  extending its benefits well beyond the Korean peninsula. The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will strengthen the NPT regime  serving as a useful example of a negotiated solution for similar problems in other parts of the world  including those in the Middle East. A peace process on the Korean peninsula will open the path to a regional security dialogue  and the resultant improvement in North-East Asian security will further strengthen regional and global cooperation for peace and prosperity.   That may be an optimistic view. But it is important that we see not only the threats and challenges in our world but also the opportunities. With the ongoing Six-Party Talks and next week’s inter-Korean summit  we see a real opportunity for change  and we hope that our partners in this process will help us to transform today’s uncertainty into tomorrow’s stability and prosperity.  Our efforts in North-East Asia are a testament to the importance of diplomacy and international cooperation  as exemplified by the United Nations. Even the most daunting challenges can be overcome when nations join forces to share the burden. For the Republic of Korea  that is a lesson we have learned through hard experience. Ever mindful of the days when we gratefully received the assistance and support of the international community for our very survival  we now try to help others  whether by working to strengthen regional security  participating in peacekeeping missions far from home  or sharing our resources and knowledge. These will be our modest contributions to the betterment of all humanity  the noble purpose embodied in the United Nations. "
"94",3892,"KWT",62,2007,"Kuwait congratulates Mr. Srgjan Kerim upon his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session  and recalls with appreciation the efforts of his predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  and her successful conduct of the work of the sixty-first session.  Despite the fact that two years have elapsed since the 2005 World Summit and seven years since the Millennium Summit  we continue to confront challenges and dangers to international peace and security  such as terrorism  poverty  hunger  the spread of dangerous infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria  deterioration of the environment and violations of human rights. Recent times have seen a number of outstanding achievements  most important among them the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  the Human Rights Council  the Central Emergency Response Fund and the United Nations Democracy Fund  and the introduction of administrative and financial reforms of the work of the Secretariat. These were all necessary achievements  but they are not enough to combat terrorism  eliminate weapons of mass destruction  affect climate change and achieve sustainable development in the developing countries  including the least developed among them.  Moreover  the revival of racial bias  religious sedition  incitement of hatred and xenophobia represent a serious threat to international peace and security. The Organization must be strong in confronting that threat seriously and firmly.  The time has come for us to change our method and approach in dealing with these universal challenges and dangers and to move from the phase of determining what should be done to the phase of actual work and the faithful fulfilment of the commitments we have taken upon ourselves at international conferences and in international agreements and conventions that we have signed and ratified.  The State of Kuwait has made good progress in translating the commitments and resolutions of the 2005 World Summit into tangible realities. It has also attained the Millennium Development Goals  particularly in the fields of education  health and advancing the role of women in society. It has designed policies capable of uplifting society and achieving further progress and social and economic development  as well as raising the standard of living of individuals. Such policies contribute to efforts to consolidate the principles of tolerance  moderation and the rejection of fanaticism.  Based upon the State of Kuwait’s absolute belief in the human values of supporting the downtrodden and helping the needy  my country has  since its independence  implemented a generous aid programme for developing countries. In 1961  it established the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development  which has financed hundreds of infrastructure projects in more than 100 countries. The value of those projects exceeds $12 billion.   The State of Kuwait is also committed to providing annual voluntary contributions to numerous international specialized agencies and organizations  as well as to regional organizations and funds that assist developing countries in achieving their development goals. Recently  the State of Kuwait allocated $300 million to the Islamic Development Bank for the elimination of poverty in Africa. That is in addition to what we contribute in humanitarian and relief aid to many countries ravaged by natural disasters.   It is regrettable that poverty  hunger and disease persist in developing countries. It is even more painful to see that more than half of the world’s population is living on less than $2 per day   a matter that requires serious examination and a real review of the impediments to development in developing countries. In that connection  the State of Kuwait calls upon the World Trade Organization and the Bretton Woods institutions to ease the restrictions imposed on exports from developing countries and to propose a more just and equitable trading system for least developed and poorest countries.  Kuwait is following with concern the developments in the situation in Iraq. We welcome the improvements in security conditions in some areas and provinces of Iraq  as a result of the implementation of relevant arrangements and a security enforcement plan carried out by the international forces in Iraq with the participation of Iraqi security forces. But there is still a dire need to redouble efforts at all levels  particularly on the political track  in order to address the security challenges posed by terrorist operations that target civilians  houses of worship and State institutions and that cost the lives of scores of innocent people daily. It is our hope that the Iraqi Government’s efforts to achieve national reconciliation will be successful and produce positive results that can lead to a comprehensive national consensus in Iraq that takes into consideration the concerns and the rights of all sectors of the Iraqi people. National reconciliation is the only way to build a democratic  free  secure and independent Iraq that is at peace with itself and its neighbours and that respects its international obligations and commitments.  In that context  we welcome the adoption of Security Council resolution 1770 (2007)  which consolidated the duties and the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. We look forward to the international community playing its vital role in helping Iraq to fulfil its political and economic obligations within the context of the International Compact with Iraq.  With regard to the issue of the three occupied Emirati islands  Kuwait would like to reaffirm its support for the position of the Gulf Cooperation Council on this issue. We hope that efforts and contacts at all levels will intensify between the sisterly United Arab Emirates and the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran in order to find a solution to this dispute consistent with the principles and rules of international law and good-neighbourly relations  thereby contributing to strengthening the security and stability of the region.  The Middle East crisis has been stagnant since the middle of the past century. The plight of the Palestinian people continues: their rights are violated  their lands are occupied and Security Council resolutions are frozen   despite intensive international and regional efforts to revive the Middle East peace process. The Israeli Government  instead of putting confidence-building measures in place  continues to create obstacles that serve to increase tensions and violence and that hinder the establishment of a climate conducive to moving the peace process ahead. Do continuing settlement activities help to achieve peace more quickly? Do the policies of detention  land confiscation  curfews  closures and restrictions of movement promote an environment of trust and stability? The answer is definitely no. Who could think that this conflict is subject to the principles of a zero-sum game? Anyone who thinks that Israel will achieve security for itself at the expense of the security of the Palestinian people is making a serious mistake. Security must be for everyone. There will be no security except through the implementation of resolutions of international legitimacy.   The State of Kuwait therefore reiterates its support for the convening of an international conference with the participation of all the parties concerned in the peace process. That meeting should follow the terms of reference of the Madrid Conference   including the provisions of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)   the principle of land for peace  the Road Map endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 1515 (2003) and the Arab Peace Initiative. The comprehensive  just and lasting peace that the international community seeks to achieve must ensure that the Palestinian people attain all their legitimate political rights. That includes the establishment of their own independent State on their own land  with Jerusalem as its capital. It must also include Israel’s withdrawal from all the Arab land occupied since 1967  including the Syrian Golan Heights.   Turning to Lebanon  we congratulate the Lebanese Government on its success in putting a decisive end to the Nahr Al-Bared sedition. We would also like to express our gratitude to the Lebanese army  which dealt with that sedition ably and firmly. We hope that that accomplishment will contribute to the return of all Lebanese parties to the negotiating table and the resumption of a Lebanese national dialogue to address the issue of presidential entitlement and the political process  in accordance with the constitution.   While we commend the regional and international efforts to achieve national reconciliation among all Lebanese parties  we condemn the political assassinations and the recurrent terrorist bombings aimed at disrupting peace and stability in that sisterly country. We renew Kuwait's commitment to stand by Lebanon and to support it in a manner that will preserve its security  unity  territorial integrity and political independence.  As for developments on the Iranian nuclear issue  we reaffirm our firm belief in the need to respect internationally recognized principles  including that of resolving conflicts through peaceful means. The State of Kuwait calls upon the international community to coordinate its efforts and to continue to work towards achieving a peaceful resolution of this crisis  so as to safeguard the peace and stability of the Gulf region. We also welcome the recent agreement reached between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as an important step towards dispelling fears and doubts surrounding the Iranian nuclear programme. It is our hope that dialogue and cooperation will resume with total transparency. That would allow us to address all the elements of this issue  so as to foster the conditions conducive to making the Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction.  In that connection  we call upon the international community to exert pressure on Israel to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to place all of its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards. We emphasize the right of all the States of the region to obtain the technology and know-how necessary to peacefully utilize nuclear energy in accordance with the terms specified by relevant international conventions.  Finally  we renew our commitment to work through the United Nations to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of our peoples to live together in a world where peace  justice and equality prevail. "
"95",3938,"LAO",62,2007,"At the outset  let me express  on behalf of the Lao delegation  my cordial salutations and congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his strong commitment to the reform process in pursuit of a strong  fully mobile and multifunctional United Nations. His great efforts and dedication to the cause of enhancing peace and security and promoting global socio-economic development and justice also deserve our praise.   The issue of development is becoming increasingly prominent. Today  our world remains far from secure. Parts of our planet are beset by violence  natural disasters and pandemics. All of humankind continues to live under the threat of nuclear weapons and in fear of terror and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. That fear will become much greater if those weapons fall into the wrong hands. Furthermore  the use or threat of use of force to resolve international problems  together with violations of the sovereignty of Member States  persists. That hinders progress in the enhancement of international peace and security and development cooperation among Member States.  Despite the fact that globalization offers new opportunities for development  developing countries   in particular least developed  landlocked and small island developing States   have not reaped its benefits  as they ought to be able to do. That is due primarily to a lack of basic infrastructure  as well as a lack of access to markets  modern technology  financing and investment. In order to guarantee greater benefits for the most vulnerable countries  the international community must intensify its concerted efforts to assist them in fully and effectively implementing its respective programmes of action  as called for in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). This should include strengthened international partnerships  increased official development assistance  greater market access and special and preferential tariffs for their exports.   Further measures should be taken to ensure debt sustainability  technology transfer and the promotion of equitable structures of international trade and finance in favour of those vulnerable countries. In addition  the international community should give priority to the provision of both financial assistance  in the form of grant aid or soft loans to those countries  and technical assistance.  The world community is facing challenges caused by human activity  such as climate change  which affects all nations  rich and poor. Yet the Member States who suffer most from this catastrophe are the least developed countries and small island developing States  due to their lack of resources and capacity for adaptation. In that context  I believe that the outcome of the High-level Event on Climate Change will significantly contribute to successful negotiations on a comprehensive agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to deal with the matter.   I hereby affirm that efforts to address climate change should not compromise attainment of the development objectives of developing countries. Addressing the issue should fully cover the three pillars of sustainable development. The efforts should be based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility between the developed and developing countries. In order to enable the developing countries  particularly the two most vulnerable groups among them  to achieve sustainable development and address climate change  the developed countries should provide them with the necessary financing for adaptation  mitigation and the transfer of appropriate technology.  For the United Nations to meet the daunting challenges that lie ahead  it should transform itself into a strong  efficient and effective organization. To that end  the United Nations reform process should be conducted in a comprehensive  inclusive  transparent and balanced manner. A strong and effective United Nations would better perform its mandate to maintain international peace and security through the peaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion of international cooperation for development. However  the United Nations reform process would not be complete without the Security Council being restructured into a more legitimate  representative  democratic and effective organ.  Like other Member States  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic welcomes the progress achieved in the implementation of the outcome of the Six-Party Talks on the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula. We believe that through committed efforts by all concerned parties  the results of the talks will be fully translated into action  thus contributing to the eventual denuclearization of the region.  The Lao People’s Democratic Republic reaffirms its continued support for the General Assembly resolutions urging an end to the economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba. Contrary to international law and the United Nations Charter  those coercive measures have caused great difficulties and losses to the people of Cuba.  The prolonged and persistent violence in the Middle East remains a cause of concern to the world community. As a result  the Palestinian  Lebanese and Iraqi peoples have suffered great losses in human life and property. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic reaffirms its support for the Palestinian people in their struggle for the right to self-determination  including the right to establish a sovereign and independent State of Palestine  living side by side in peace with Israel and other countries in the region.  The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is enjoying unwavering peace  political and social stability and economic growth. This year is the second year of the continued implementation of the country’s sixth Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan  for 2006 to 2010. As a result  significant achievements have been recorded. The poverty rate declined from 48 per cent in 1990 to 28 per cent in 2005. Opium cultivation was completely eradicated in 2006. The practice of shifting cultivation declined six times from 2001 to 2005. Tourism  particularly cultural and ecotourism  has been broadly promoted and expanded  thus attracting more and more tourists to the country. The Lao Government continues to pursue a development policy that is aimed at promotion of sustainable development  sustained use and conservation of natural resources  exploitation of clean energy and protection of the environment and the ecosystem.  In November 2006  in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme  the Lao Government held the ninth Round-Table Meeting  which provided a consultative forum for the development partners and various Lao Government agencies to engage in a constructive and frank dialogue on development assistance. The meeting adopted the Vientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness  which reflects the commitments of the Lao Government and its development partners to improve the coordination and effectiveness of official development assistance.  In pursuance of its foreign policy of peace  friendship and cooperation with all countries in the world  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has had diplomatic relations with 125 countries and has become a member of various regional and international organizations  with a view to integrating itself into the regional and international economic system. One of the significant events for the Lao People’s Democratic Republic this year is the convening of the twenty-third ministerial meeting of the International Organization of la Francophonie on 20 and 21 November 2007 in Vientiane. As the host country  the Lao Government would like to encourage all member States to participate and actively contribute to the success of that meeting.  To conclude  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic reaffirms its unswerving commitment to continue cooperating with the international community in pursuit of a peaceful  equitable and prosperous world  free of fear and want  in order to ensure the well-being of all peoples on the basis of respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law  as well as the recognition of diversity and respect for the social  cultural and historic reality of each country. To that end  greater efforts and sacrifices are definitely required from us all. Yet I am sure that together we will be able to make it happen. "
"96",3981,"LBN",62,2007,"Allow me to congratulate you  Mr. President on your election as President of General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I wish you every success. I would also like to offer my gratitude to your predecessor  Sheikha Haya Al-Khalifa for the outstanding job she has performed as the first Arab woman to ever preside over this austere body. Finally  I would like to thank His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for all his efforts on behalf of world peace and security.  A year ago  I spoke from this podium about Israel’s brutalities against my country and its atrocious 33-day war. I had hoped then that those tragic events that we had bitterly lived and suffered through in Lebanon would pave the way for activating the Middle East process based on the Arab Peace Initiative that was endorsed at the Beirut Arab Summit in 2002.  Regrettably  nothing thrives in our region more than violence and grudges  and nothing deafens more than the sound of war  while all calls to stimulate the peace process find no response. It is against that gloomy background and with a mix of anticipation and reservation that we await the results of the Middle East peace conference that is to be held in the near future. In that respect  I would like to reaffirm certain realities that cannot be ignored in any settlement  because I believe that unless we learn from our past mistakes  we will not be able to take full advantage of present opportunities.  First  for any settlement to the Middle East crisis to succeed  it must be lasting  just and global. Secondly  a viable solution must call for the implementation of all United Nations resolutions that pertain to the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories. Thirdly  paramount to all Arab rights is the right of return of the Palestinian refugees in accordance with resolution 194 (III) and the rejection of all calls for their resettlement in their temporary host countries.  The resettlement of the Palestinians is contrary to the expressed will of world legitimacy as embodied in the General Assembly. Moreover  and more specifically in Lebanon  it would dangerously alter the delicate balance of Lebanon’s existence as a nation based on diversity and the coexistence of a large number of its sects  which have lived side by side in harmony and enjoyed mutual respect. In this regard  Lebanon fully rejects efforts to empty the Beirut Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 of its contents  namely by excluding the right of return for Palestinians. The Initiative  we believe  contains a realistic and global solution to the Middle East conflict  and its implementation could bring about stability and security for all parties.  A year ago  the Security Council adopted resolution 1701 (2006)  which put an end to Israel’s aggression against Lebanon. We were quick to abide by that resolution. Our armed forces have closely cooperated with the units of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  as stipulated in their mission statements and as recounted in the reports of the Secretary-General on the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006).  Today  as I stand here again to reiterate Lebanon’s commitment to implementing that resolution  I wonder why we are still in the phase of the cessation of hostilities and have not yet moved into the ceasefire phase  as called for in the resolution. That matter remains suspect to many Lebanese  especially since Israel continues  up to this very moment  to violate our land  sea and skies. So far  there have been over 500 breaches since the adoption of the resolution. I call upon the world community to remain vigilant regarding any malicious intentions harboured by Israel against Lebanon  as that could lead to another conflagration in the region.  Despite the fact that the Lebanese recall with pain  agony and distress last year’s destructive and hostile war against their country  they are proud of their national resistance and their army  who were able to jointly claim a historic victory over one of the world’s strongest military arsenals  which had violated all international and ethical norms and wanted to terminate Lebanon’s role as a nation characterized by coexistence among all its religious sects.  With regard to securing the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006)  we in Lebanon believe that that will only happen when our nation regains its occupied Sheba’a farms  the Kfar Shouba Hills and some northern parts of the village of Ghajar; when we secure the release of Lebanese prisoners held in Israeli jails; when Lebanon’s legitimate rights to its water resources are restored; and when Lebanon is given maps of the landmines and the sites of cluster bombs.  In this regard  we welcome efforts made by the United Nations in terms of studying documents and maps related to the Sheba’a farms  and we express our relief over the progress made so far in verifying their Lebanese identity. We look forward to practical measures that would end Israeli occupation and hand over those territories and water rights to Lebanon.  The United Nations has always shown Lebanon special concern  and such concern is clearly manifested in all United Nations resolutions on Lebanon. The Lebanese  who reiterate their commitment to the implementation of those resolutions  wish to see those resolutions implemented in a fair manner and on a real and constant basis. As you know by now  the Special Tribunal for Lebanon  which was established to try the assassins of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri  had been a controversial issue with regard to the circumstances of its establishment. We referred to that in detail in our letters to the Secretary-General and asked that copies be handed over to all Security Council Member States and other copies be kept as reference documents at the United Nations.  We did this in the belief that international justice should be reinforced. Since the very first moment of the heinous crime of the assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri  we have attempted to seek the whole truth  and I was probably the first to ask the then Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  to set up an impartial international investigation commission.  I believe the best way now to enable all to overcome the controversy caused by the international tribunal would be to hold an impartial  transparent and just hearing that seeks to determine the whole truth. Only then would the Lebanese be assured that the tribunal is just.  Lebanon is about to hold democratic presidential elections in which the Lebanese will make their choice in a free and responsible manner. Unfortunately  there have been attempts by international parties to intervene in Lebanon’s domestic affairs in a way that contradicts international norms. Such interference could instigate hatred and increase tensions on the Lebanese scene  which might have negative repercussions not only on upcoming presidential elections but also on the safety of the Lebanese.  Lebanon welcomes all foreign assistance and pays tribute to those countries that have stood by it in the wake of last July’s destructive Israeli war. Lebanon hopes  however  that any foreign assistance to Lebanon is made to all the Lebanese people  without any discrimination  in order to stop possible divisions among them. Foreign aid to Lebanon should be made as a gesture of support to the restoration of Lebanon’s sovereignty and the unity of the Lebanese people.  That is why we urge the international community  through its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations  to stop foreign intervention in the domestic affairs of Member States. Consecutive events in Lebanon have shown that the Lebanese are capable of making their own decisions and their own choices and can live side by side and interact peacefully within institutional framework established by their civic bodies and protected by their security institutions  namely their national army.  Since we are referring to the national army  we should highlight the heroic confrontations of the army with an extremely dangerous terrorist organization in the past three months  an organization equipped with updated weapons and believing in destructive objectives that targeted Lebanon and many other States in the region. The costly price paid by our national army in terms of human losses and injuries aimed at reinstating Lebanon’s national goals of confronting and fighting terrorism. Lebanon has and will always be a nation that supports peace and justice and promotes democratic values. However  to enable Lebanon to confront and curb terrorism  real assistance should be given to its national army in order to accomplish its national and security goals.  In a world that witnesses the daily bloodshed known as “the conflict of civilizations”  and in a world that is sharply and deeply divided between East and West  I find myself addressing the international community as a man of experience. From here  I urge the world community not to allow Lebanon to fall  because the falling apart of Lebanon would mean a collapse of moderation and a victory for those who favour the use of force. Lebanon remains a unique message to the world  a country where religions and cultures interact peacefully  so that we can live together  as noted by His Holiness the late Pope John Paul II.  As a citizen of Lebanon  a small country that has survived against all odds  I urge you not to retreat in the face of adversity and to support what is right and just. A last glimpse of a burning Middle East  where the flames devour the meek and the mighty  should allow you to reflect upon the choices ahead  lest it become too late. "
"97",4027,"LBR",62,2007,"I congratulate the delegation  Government and the people of the Republic of Macedonia on Mr. Srgjan Kerim’s election as President of the sixty-second session of the United Nations General Assembly. On behalf of my Government  I acknowledge the astute diplomatic skills and wisdom that he brings to this important assignment. May he rest assured of my delegation’s support in his endeavours.  Similarly  it gives me great pleasure to congratulate our new Secretary-General  Mr. Ban  Ki-moon  of the Republic of Korea  on his election as Secretary-General of this Organization. It is the belief of my Government that the United Nations will greatly benefit from his wealth of experience as a seasoned diplomat and statesman. Nearly two years ago  Liberia held its first post-conflict elections  following more than 14 years of civil war. We were strongly supported by the United Nations  the African Union  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and members of the international community  including the United States  the European Union  the People’s Republic of China and Japan. We commend you for your continued support toward our national reconstruction programmes.  My Government welcomes and highly appreciates the recent decision of the Security Council to lift the sanctions which it saw fit to impose on the timber and diamond sectors in Liberia. We pledge our fullest cooperation with the United Nations as it partners our country’s reform  which undoubtedly will strengthen the good governance procedures. Although the imposition of sanctions was considered by many as punitive  I am gratified to inform you that the Liberian people viewed the sanctions as prudent and corrective. The sanctions helped to accelerate the adoption of new laws and the institutionalization of appropriate mechanisms to ensure that we would never again allow conditions such as those that gave rise to their imposition.  We also thank the international community for its continued support to peacebuilding and the strengthening of instruments of security and stability in Liberia. In spite of the gains of peace  Liberia remains fragile. The recent decision by the Security Council to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) is timely and relevant. Liberia remains grateful for that and other decisions aimed at sustaining peace and stability in the country.  Democracy is on an irreversible course in Africa. The values of democratic governance and the rule of law are also on an upward march. My Government notes with great delight the successful holding of relatively peaceful  free  fair and democratic elections in Sierra Leone  Nigeria  Mauritania and Mali. From our experience in Liberia  we know that democratic elections in themselves do not provide quick answers to the monumental problems and challenges that face a new and emerging post-conflict nation. They do  however  create the environment  and potentially unleash opportunities  for freedom and individual enterprise to thrive and prosper. Because such democracies are in their infancy  they need the support of bilateral and multilateral partners. We therefore call on the United Nations  the African Union and bilateral and multilateral partners to support all new democracies and to help us meet the multifaceted needs of our people.  Liberia reaffirms its belief in the United Nations as the best institution for the promotion and protection of international peace and security and the resolution of crises around our world. Our faith in the United Nations is rooted in our conviction that it represents mankind’s best hope and vehicle for the advancement of the common purpose of humanity.  Our generation must avoid the temptation to use the instruments of our common Organization for narrow agendas that undermine its Charter. In this new millennium  the United Nations must continue to renew its resolve to promote  protect and sustain the universal virtues of liberty  equality  solidarity  tolerance and non-violence  while simultaneously respecting and protecting our environment  pursuant to the mandate of the Millennium Summit. Liberia commits itself to being a strong partner and advocate for the promotion of these shared values of our common humanity. But as the United Nations pursues those objectives  we must recognize that it cannot expect to succeed using frameworks that are nearly three quarters of a century old. The United Nations needs to be  and must be  reformed.   Liberia and other Member States have advanced practical suggestions for the reform agenda. Liberia offers the following proposals: first  a timely review and reconfiguration of the Security Council  including the current decision-making machinery and processes of the Organization  should be conducted to make it more relevant and representative of the world community; secondly  mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that the Charter remains inviolate; and  thirdly  careful consideration should be given to due process in dealing with Member States.  Pursuant to our call for reform of the United Nations  we today call on Member States to give meaning and expression to gender equality. We propose that the United Nations recommit itself to ensuring an equitable partnership of women and men in the leadership of the Organization. Reforming the United Nations also means reforming our attitude towards women and other minority groups worldwide. There is no doubt in our mind that women will significantly  contribute to the process of change in this Organization.  Fully cognizant of the evidence that the dividends of peace and security are always greater than the debilitating effects of conflict  Liberia continues to work within the regional framework of the Mano River Union  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  and the African Union to ensure the realization and advancement of peace in the subregion and on the African continent. It is said in my country that there is no capitalism without capital. Peace is sustained only with the economic empowerment of all people.  In that regard  since its inauguration our Government has engaged in active subregional initiatives to improve and strengthen ties of friendship and economic cooperation with our immediate neighbours in the Mano River Basin and the ECOWAS Community. As a result of our efforts  the instruments of peace and security and the potential of trade rationalization in our subregion are stronger today than they ever were a few years ago. Under the chairmanship of Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf  the Mano River Union has assumed a new vibrancy and renewed sense of cohesion and common purpose. Citizens of the Mano River Union countries are exchanging more frequent visits  and undertaking programmes aimed at enhancing integration and peace. That is why we were happy to host President Ernest Bai Koroma a few days following his inauguration as President of Sierra Leone.  As events in the Middle East continue to claim our attention in the world community  we must not lose sight of similarly grave situations in Africa. I refer to the continuous humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur in the Sudan  and crises in Somalia  Guinea-Bissau  Côte d’Ivoire  Ethiopia  Eritrea  Chad  Burundi  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the Central African Republic and Uganda  among others. My Government therefore welcomes Security Council resolution 1769 (2007) and the consensus reached for the deployment of a hybrid African Union-United Nations force in Darfur following months of painstaking negotiations. We further urge countries that have pledged logistical and other support to fulfil their promises to ensure the timely deployment of the peacekeeping force in Darfur. We applaud the progress made in the resolution of the crisis in our sisterly Republic of Cote d'Ivoire. My delegation calls for strong support of the Ouagadougou agreement  which provides the best possible framework for peace  security and stability in that country. Peace and security in Cote d’Ivoire means peace and security in Liberia  and indeed  in the Mano River Basin and the Economic Community of West African States.  The world has witnessed and continues to witness phenomenal advances in science and technology leading to the transformation of industrialization and the improvement of the human condition. We must work to save our planet  because  when we save our common Earth  we assure the survival of all of its inhabitants.  Liberia supports the efforts of the Commission on Sustainable Development  the Kyoto Protocol  the decision reached on Agenda 21 at the 1992 Rio Conference and the recent high-profile conference hosted here on climate change  intended to raise international awareness of the degradation of the environment and the need for collaborative efforts to reverse negative trends. There could be no theme more appropriate and timely for this year’s general debate than the theme “Responding to Climate Change”.   This debate will  we are confident  accentuate the issues of environment and stimulate increased international action. Liberia is concerned about the rapid degradation of the climate. We hope that this session will produce a consensus on how to save succeeding generations from the impact of deteriorating climate.   In our world today  there is a correlation between war  civil conflict and the spread of HIV/AIDS. The HIV/AIDS pandemic targets and destroys our human capital  the backbone of our socio-economic development. The records of the United Nations and other organizations show that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS increases in countries affected by war and civil conflicts  owing to the mass movement of populations. Post-conflict countries therefore need special attention if the scourge of HIV/AIDS is to be overcome.  The devastating impact of HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases has contributed significantly in retarding the progress of the developing nations.   African nations must develop the political will to combat the health crisis on our continent. To this end  we call upon our partners in the developed world to treat the issue of antiretroviral drugs as a purely social and humanitarian matter of an emergency nature  outside of politics. Liberia recently set up its National AIDS Commission to advance practical strategies that will help to halt the spread of this deadly disease. We are hopeful that prudent action  including a change of life styles coupled with antiviral drugs  will help address this emerging catastrophe.   Liberia continues to be burdened by huge debts owed to bilateral and multilateral creditors. Servicing these debts remains a major priority of the Government of Liberia. However  our capacity to make payment is constrained owing to the severe resource challenges arising out of a 14-year civil war. There is a traditional parable in my country which says that you cannot dig a hole to fill a hole. We renew our Government’s plea for international empathy and favourable consideration of our debt cancellation request.  We reassure all of our bilateral and multilateral creditors of our commitment to continue to work with them to develop the necessary framework toward the actualization of Liberia’s debt relief initiatives.  We also thank all our partners  especially the United States  Great Britain  China and Germany among others  for active steps taken toward debt relief for Liberia.   I assure you that after learning a costly lesson in violence  the people of Liberia are determined to settle their differences through peaceful means. With your support  we have found a better way to resolve our differences. We have resolved to forgive one another  pick up our dignity and pride and move forward in unity and oneness of purpose with strong determination to work for a better and brighter future. Our unity in fostering the faith of our founding fathers to build a nation dedicated to freedom  liberty and justice for all remains undaunted.  We are confident that our international partners want to see a success story in Liberia. Let me assure this Assembly that nobody wants that more than Liberians themselves! May the Almighty God bless us  protect our sovereignties  unify us  preserve our dignities and keep us safe. "
"98",4072,"LBY",62,2007,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am confident that  thanks to his experience and wisdom  he will lead the work of this forum to the best results. I would also like to take this opportunity to express our satisfaction with the manner in which Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa conducted the deliberations of the General Assembly at its previous session and the efforts she made for United Nations reform and  with regard to several controversial issues  to arrive at solutions acceptable to all. I also wish to express our gratitude for the efforts exerted by His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  since his appointment as Secretary-General  to implement the resolutions of the United Nations and to achieve the purposes of the Charter.  The reform of the United Nations has been the central issue in our deliberations in the General Assembly and in a number of other forums over the past two years. We were able to move forward towards achieving our goals on some aspects of the reform process. However  there is still a long way to go  especially in the absence of real progress towards reforming the Security Council and enhancing the role of the General Assembly.  That issue has been the subject of intensive consultations in which many ideas were put forward  some of which were realistic and based on the principles of equal sovereignty for all nations and equitable geographical representation. Other ideas  however  involved consolidating the control of the powerful States over the United Nations bodies and the concept that those with privileges in the Security Council should maintain those privileges and reject any active role for other actors in that respect. That latter attitude cannot lead to any true reform contributing to the realization of the purposes embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.  A realistic assessment of progress made in the process of United Nations reform  especially in light of the impasse in negotiations regarding Security Council reform  leads us to the conviction that there is an urgent need for a new world summit conference that would push forward the reform process and bring to a conclusion the work that we began two years ago.  In order to achieve this  Libya calls  from this podium  for a high-level summit meeting to be held at the United Nations in Geneva within the framework of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly  in 2008. Such a meeting would be devoted to the reform process of the United Nations and the expansion of the Security Council. Holding such an important meeting in Geneva  a city that lies at the centre of the world  would provide the opportunity for all world leaders to attend  to present constructive proposals and to participate in decision-making regarding this thorny issue that concerns the entire world.  True reform of the United Nations means putting decision-making powers in the hands of all of its Members  that is to say  in the hands of the General Assembly  where all countries have equal vote. The Security Council would thus become an instrument for implementing General Assembly resolutions and we would overcome the obstacles caused by the veto  which puts international decision-making power in the hands of the permanent members of the Security Council and greatly encourages selectivity and double standards in dealing with international problems.  In our efforts to reform the Security Council  we must consider a new formula for permanent membership in which membership would be awarded to geographical groups and not to specific countries. In this regard  we demand that the African Union   since Africa is the only continent which has no representative among the permanent members   be granted permanent membership in the Security Council with all the privileges enjoyed by other permanent members.  While we encourage the current negotiations regarding reform of the Security Council  we stress the fact that Libya adheres to the Common African Position  issued at the fifth African Union Summit  held in Sirte on 4 and 5 July 2005. This position was confirmed at subsequent African Union summit conferences. It calls for the African continent to be granted five non-permanent seats and two permanent seats with all the privileges that other permanent members enjoy  including the right of veto.  Libya seeks the support of all Member States for a seat on the Security Council so that it may continue to carry out its efforts to achieve the objectives of the United Nations  building on its experience of non-permanent membership in 1976 and 1977. Libya has therefore submitted its candidature for non-permanent membership for the coming period 2008-2009. This candidature enjoys the support of the African Union as expressed in its resolution EX.CL/DEC. 308 (IX) issued in Banjul on 29 June 2007  of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in its resolution ORG 33/2 issued in Baku on 21 June 2006 and of the Arab League in its resolution on 6 September 2006.  Libya’s firm commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  its notable contribution to international peace and security and its support for development  especially in Africa  demonstrate that Libya is highly qualified for membership in the Security Council.  As a member of the Council  Libya would strive to emphasize the central role played by the United Nations in achieving international peace and security; to strengthen respect for international law and the provisions of the United Nations Charter; to enhance pluralism in international relations through the United Nations; to strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in solving international problems; to contribute to United Nations reform; to work to increase cooperation and coordination between the Security Council and the other organs of the United Nations  particularly the General Assembly; to encourage swift and effective international cooperation and coordination in disaster management and in the protection of human rights; to contribute to the creation of permanent solutions to international problems based on justice  equity  and respect for the principles of international law and to encourage further cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union in the areas of conflict resolution  consolidation of peace and support for development in Africa.  Libya strongly believes in the objectives of the United Nations and consistently meets its obligations to the Organization. Among Member States  Libya was the second-largest African contributor to the United Nations budget and to the budget of peacekeeping operations in the biennium 2004-2006. Furthermore  Libya provides a large share of voluntary contributions to serve the goals of the United Nations.  Moreover  Libya is one of the countries that have most often resorted to the mechanisms of the United Nations to resolve international disagreements. For example  it resorted to the International Court of Justice to resolve its border problems with Chad  Tunisia and Malta and has accepted and implemented the rulings of the Court.  Libya has been a key mediator in the resolution of a number of conflicts and disputes  especially in Africa  and has dispatched peacekeeping forces to the Central African Republic  monitored the border between Chad and the Sudan and taken part in the United Nations mission in Darfur. Libya has also begun to nominate personnel from the Libyan police force to serve in United Nations missions in a number of African places.  Libya has established partnerships with a number of countries  in the field of development  particularly in Africa. Additionally  in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  Libya is implementing numerous projects that provide food in a number of African and Arab States.  In cooperation with Cuba and Nigeria  Libya established the South-South Programme for health care in Africa and  in 2006  launched the Gaddafi Programme for African women  children and young people  which provides health care and educational services in Africa.  Libya has provided humanitarian aid to numerous countries in order to alleviate the effects of disasters. Recipient countries have included Niger  Chad  the Sudan  Somalia  Palestine  Indonesia  Pakistan and Mauritania. Libya has also provided substantial aid to several African countries to combat desert locusts.  In the field of disarmament  Libya believes that comprehensive and complete disarmament  beginning with the elimination of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)  is an essential prerequisite for the consolidation of international peace and security. For this reason  Libya initiated its voluntary abandonment of all programmes related to WMDs and their means of delivery. Libya hopes that all nations that possess such weapons or related programmes will follow its exemplary behaviour.  International cooperation  under the auspices of the United Nations  has achieved good results in the fight against terrorism. However  concentrating on the fight against this phenomenon  while ignoring its root causes  will not bring terrorism to an end. Libya was among the first countries that called for coordination of international efforts to fight global terrorism. Since 1992  Libya has called for a special session of the General Assembly to study this phenomenon and to take the necessary measures to combat it by eradicating its root causes.  We believe that the time has come to heed this call and establish a precise definition of terrorism that would protect human rights and halt the practice of confusing terrorism with the legitimate right of people to fight against foreign occupation and to exercise self-determination and attain independence.  Ending terrorism will require practical measures to eliminate its root causes  including effective action to promote human rights for all peoples  putting a stop to acts of aggression and the occupation of the land of others  fighting poverty and encouraging democracy.  Foreign occupation is the worst form of terrorism  because occupation forces subject entire peoples to measures which violate the most basic principles of human rights and commit daily crimes against those peoples in order to maintain their occupation. In our campaign to fight terrorism  it is imperative that we coordinate our efforts to finally put an end to foreign occupation  enable peoples to exercise their right to self-determination and prevent interference in internal affairs.   We urgently need to implement the pledges that we adopted in the Millennium Declaration  the Doha Declaration and the outcomes of the Monterrey and Johannesburg conferences so that we can make ideal use of our planet’s resources  end conflict  poverty  illiteracy and disease  provide all people with safe drinking water  safeguard the environment and achieve sustainable development.   It falls upon the shoulders of the United Nations  in particular the Economic and Social Council  to establish international partnerships for development which can achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Such partnerships should facilitate dialogue between North and South on the basis of respect for sovereignty  equality and sharing of benefits  and should ensure that we reach the agreed goal of devoting 0.7 per cent of the developed countries’ gross national income to official development assistance (ODA) to developing countries. Such partnerships must likewise ensure the appropriate application of all multilateral free trade principles and must strengthen World Trade Organization measures regarding preferential treatment for developing countries  including making it easier for developing countries to join that organization.   Countries with a colonial past bear the largest share of responsibility to provide aid to developing countries and to compensate them for the damage they suffered during the colonial era. Similarly  countries that waged war on the territories of other countries have a responsibility to remove the mines  unexploded ordnance and explosive remnants of war they left in those countries. They must provide the necessary maps  equipment and technical know-how to reclaim and rehabilitate damaged land in those developing countries.   I call upon all Member States to aid the African Union in its efforts to ensure that all African countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals.   The Palestinian people have lived in great misery for more than half a century  since their land was seized. More than half of them were displaced to various parts of the world and those who remain have been subjected to a bloody and vicious Israeli occupation and to systematic violations of international humanitarian law: houses are demolished  lands are confiscated and Palestinian agricultural land is bulldozed. Under siege and denied food and medicine  inhabitants are expelled and unarmed citizens killed while the building of an apartheid wall continues. The oppression to which the Palestinian people are subjected and the failure of the United Nations to protect them and to aid them in attaining their rights  the right of return  the right to self-determination and the right to establish an independent State on all Palestinian land   are factors that prevent the restoration of peace and security in the region. It is time to address the issue of Palestine more seriously and to refrain from attempts to impose a fait accompli on the Palestinian people  depriving them of their legitimate rights.   The tragedy that has befallen brotherly Iraq and that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths  injuries and refugees  requires an urgent United Nations initiative to stop the bleeding  resolve the crisis  ensure the withdrawal of the occupation forces  restore Iraq’s stability and sovereignty  maintain Iraq’s territorial integrity and empower the Iraqis to control their own resources and freely decide their own destiny  while enabling all citizens to participate in the administration of their country without the marginalization of any group by any other group  so that peace  security and prosperity may prevail in that country.  "
"99",4105,"LCA",62,2007,"The pleasure is mine at this juncture  to join the other Members of the United Nations family in congratulating you  Mr. President on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We wish you success in all your efforts and assure you of our full cooperation. We also wish to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Sheika Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for the diligent manner in which she spearheaded the work of this body at its sixty-first session. In similar vein  we express our continued support for the endeavours of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We are confident that he will continue to provide committed leadership to this Organization in the defence and promotion of its noble principles and values in every corner of the globe.   I begin my address on a sad note. It is with much pain that I must inform this body that the person who brought Saint Lucia to independence and consequently to this body and who  but for the will of the Almighty would have addressed you today   Sir John George Melvin Compton  our first and latest Prime Minister   was laid to rest in Saint Lucia last Tuesday  18 September. Our nation and region suffered a great loss  but we remain committed to seizing every opportunity to carry on his life’s work of aiding the cause that needs assistance against the wrong that needs resistance  and in so doing continue to honour him. What I am about to say reflects his thoughts on and aspirations for this Assembly and for the United Nations Organization in general.   We note that a significant part of our journey towards the realization of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been covered in terms of time and that in some respects there has been some achievement to date. However  it is also true that only mixed progress  regionally and internationally  has been recorded so far. Millions continue to live in conditions of abject poverty  despite the commitments made in 2000 and 2005. The sad fact is that a great deal of work still remains to be done  and urgently  if we are to achieve the MDGs and see real changes in the conditions of existence for such large numbers of people.  We would be well advised to embark upon a period of serious reflection and stock-taking  an exercise involving an honest assessment of our achievements and failures  with a view to repositioning ourselves as necessary to ensure that we achieve the noble objectives set out in the Millennium Development Goals by the projected year 2015.   On our own front  Saint Lucia has made significant strides over the years towards the achievement of the MDGs. We intend to continue on a steady path towards that end. Not only has the country attained universal primary education  but a programme of universal access to free secondary education for our young citizens has been introduced.  Saint Lucia’s progress in the health sector is also evident. Over the last 25 years  the country has experienced significant improvements in most health-related indicators  including life expectancy  immunization coverage and infant mortality  while significant reductions have been experienced in respect of communicable diseases and lifestyle-related illnesses. A universal programme of free health care is currently in the early stages of implementation.  Over the years  too  Saint Lucia has consistently worked toward a reduction in the incidence of non-communicable diseases. Serious attention has also been given to combating the HIV/AIDS problem  which remains a major challenge to Saint Lucia and other countries in the Caribbean region. Efforts to address this issue are being pursued  mainly through education  including the elimination of stigma associated with this disease  early detection and treatment programmes and the provision of free or subsidized antiretroviral drugs.  As a small island developing State  Saint Lucia finds it beneficial to undertake this daunting task through regional and international cooperation. Accordingly  through the Pan-Caribbean Partnership against HIV/AIDS  we collaborate with other countries in the wider Caribbean region in addressing the pandemic. While this regional mechanism  which includes the 15 members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) as well as other countries in the wider Caribbean region  has facilitated our cooperative approach to addressing this challenge  it is clear that increased and sustained international cooperation is critical to our efforts if we are to succeed in our fight against this disease. In this regard  we welcome the assistance being provided by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria  working with other partners  and we look forward to its continued support.  Let me take this opportunity to thank our traditional friends and donors  such as the United Kingdom  the United States  Canada  France  the European Union and the Commonwealth  to name the most prominent  who over the years have provided much financial and technical assistance to our country and to the region. We also welcome the contribution of those other States and institutions that have demonstrated their readiness to work with us in the realization of our development objectives. We are  of course  always willing to develop new beneficial relationships and to collaborate with all who understand and appreciate our efforts and our principles. In this regard  we take special note of the announcement by Norway of its pledge of $1 billion over 10 years to support the Millennium Goals on child and maternal support.  Within the context of South-South cooperation  Saint Lucia will continue to work with other developing country partners in its quest for economic and social development. In the light of the positive benefits gained from cooperation programmes with those partners  we remain convinced that  according to the United Nations Development Programme Administrator’s report on this issue  South-South cooperation is one of the main drivers of development effectiveness  requiring its integration in the development cooperation activities of all the organizations in the United Nations system.   Saint Lucia therefore welcomes continued United Nations support for efforts geared towards strengthening and advancing South-South cooperation. We are convinced that this cooperation modality should be strengthened in partnership with our developed country partners and other stakeholders and should therefore complement rather than substitute for North-South cooperation.  The Government of Saint Lucia reiterates its commitment to the ideals of regionalism and to the deepening of the integration process within our region. Saint Lucia continues to partner with sister States of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States and the wider Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to develop mechanisms  including the Eastern Caribbean States Economic Union and the Caribbean Community Single Market and Economy  to enhance the prospects for improving the quality of life of our people. We therefore welcome the assistance of this body and that of those who have travelled the road to regionalism before us.  Saint Lucia is pleased to note that Haiti’s march toward democratic governance  recommenced just over one year ago  continues to be assisted and sustained by the generous efforts of the international community. While we had hoped for a longer mandate period for the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in that country  we accept the decision of the Security Council to extend that mandate to enable it to continue to work towards ensuring that Haiti’s political and social stability are restored and maintained.   Under no circumstance should Haiti be left stranded in midstream  as the consequences would be too catastrophic to contemplate. We continue  therefore  to call for the sustained release of pledged development resources so that the Government and the people of Haiti may continue to meaningfully  and in a sustainable manner  address the numerous challenges facing their country.  Saint Lucia places great importance on the follow-up of the international development agenda espoused in the Monterrey Consensus on financing for development. Given the plethora of challenges confronting developing countries such as Saint Lucia in this increasingly globalized and inequitable international economy  financing for development continues to be key to the achievement of the MDGs and the internationally agreed development goals.  Saint Lucia recognizes the important commitments made over the years by some developed country partners with regard to development finance. We also appreciate the pledges made to significantly improve the level of official development assistance (ODA) in order to achieve the goal of 0.7 per cent of developed countries’ gross domestic product. Moreover  we are pleased about the Group of Eight decision in 2005 to forgive the debt of some African countries  and its more recent decision to double development assistance to Africa.  We lament  however  that  despite these commitments  development assistance declined in 2006. Moreover  development financing continued to be subject to conditionalities imposed by donors and failed to meet and support the nationally defined priorities of developing countries. It is our hope that the 2008 Doha Review Conference will seriously address those concerns in the light of the significance of financing for development at this stage of our journey towards 2015.  Saint Lucia is well aware of the increasing interdependence that characterizes this international community  the importance of building partnerships and the need to work within a multilateral framework in order to meet the challenges of this century. For this reason  we welcome the continued search for ways to reposition the United Nations system so it can better fulfil its mandate in accordance with its Charter. While we are conscious of the magnitude of the task of reforming the United Nations  we remain confident that Member States will bring the requisite political will to bear on the process.  Saint Lucia continues to underscore the importance of social and economic development  basic human rights  mutual respect and goodwill among nations  and their relevance to the maintenance of international peace and security. For these reasons  we are concerned that peace and security remain the exclusive preserve of the Security Council and a few select Member States. Saint Lucia continues to support reform and expansion of the Security Council aimed at making it more representative. It is our hope that this reform would reflect the role and contribution of developing countries in helping to resolve the ever-growing and increasingly complex challenges of today’s world.  Many  if not all of our countries celebrate our sovereignty with pomp  ceremony and pride  and in accordance with that sovereignty  we take our seat in this body. All of the rules and requirements for membership are spelled out in the Charter of our noble institution. Within this body our relationship with our partners is based on a commitment to the principles of mutual respect and understanding. For this reason  we recognize that the Republic of China   Taiwan   a democratic country of over 23 million people  has continued to abide by the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  although it is not a Member of the United Nations. Taiwan has made significant contributions to global development by providing economic and technical assistance to other developing countries in their pursuit of development and their attainment of the MDGs.  We believe that sovereignty is derived from the will of peoples and from the realization or actualization of the right to self-determination. We are therefore saddened that the will of the people of Taiwan  expressed by their duly elected representatives  continues to be ignored by this body. Saint Lucia therefore looks forward to the day when Taiwan will assume its place alongside other countries of the world in the halls of this Organization.  For small States  peace and security are critical to their sustainable development. Thus  the spread of small arms to our region continues to be an especially disturbing issue and is a major contributing factor to crime and insecurity. This situation is particularly ironic given the fact that neither arms nor ammunition are produced in our region. We therefore call on those States that produce small arms and ammunition to enact appropriate measures to reduce their illicit export  which threatens the security and stability of the Caribbean.  Saint Lucia and other small island developing States continue to express concerns about our extreme vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change. Small islands and low-lying coastal areas are threatened daily by the impact of a rising sea level  while others are already experiencing the untold effects created by the increase in the melting of polar ice and the consequent loss of significant portions of their land mass.   For us  this climate change issue is directly related to our development. It threatens the very core of our social  economic and political security. It threatens our very existence.  The dangers we face as a result of the hazardous level of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are well known and documented. Urgent  resolute action is therefore required to reverse this situation.  Saint Lucia welcomes the efforts currently being made to place the issue of climate change more visibly on the agenda of the United Nations. We acknowledge the recent G-8 commitment to work positively within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to address the issue. We maintain the view that this important issue should be discussed within the appropriate forums in order not to lose sight of the real development-related objectives that vulnerable small island developing countries like Saint Lucia are seeking to promote.  Saint Lucia joins with other members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in calling for the problems of the rise of sea level and climate change to be addressed as a matter of urgency. We will continue to play our part through the development of appropriate national development strategies and the creation of mechanisms to enable us to mitigate against and adapt to the adverse impact of climate change. We stress  however  that the largest producers of greenhouse gases must bear the responsibility for the damage being caused to the global environment and in particular to the vulnerable countries whose sustainability and very existence are increasingly threatened by their actions.  We remain concerned that the international community has yet to honour its responsibility and commitment to the full implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. We insist on the urgent and proper mainstreaming of the Strategy into the appropriate work programmes of the United Nations agencies and international conventions. We look forward to the thirteenth meeting of the Conference of Parties on Bali in Indonesia in December of this year  where we hope significant negotiations will be launched with a view to seriously addressing the disastrous effects of climate change on small island developing States. It is our wish that this Conference of Parties should seek to achieve substantial and legally binding emission reductions in the shortest possible period  as well as explore ways to significantly increase the level of resources available to developing countries  and to the small island developing States  in particular  to assist in adapting to the impacts of climate change.  While economic and trade policy reform  in principle  holds much promise for small developing countries  the international community must understand that the “one size fits all” approach to trade arrangements is inappropriate and unrealistic and will not advance the cause of equitable global economic development. This approach has led to a reversal in many small States of the progress made through hard work and sacrifice by their populations.   This fact is most evident in the case of Saint Lucia and other small banana- and sugar-producing countries of the Eastern Caribbean. The mindless application of inappropriate rules has caused much pain among the same populations that are being challenged to meet the MDGs. Saint Lucia therefore reiterates its call for the establishment of a set of trading rules flexible enough to take into account the concerns of small States  assist them in promoting economic development  provide opportunities for their people and  consequently  assist them in achieving the MDGs by the stipulated deadline date.  Lastly  and looking towards the future  children are the future  and poverty impacts children disproportionately  seriously affecting their ability to achieve. Unless we can all maintain the development momentum achieved by previous generations  the future of our children  and indeed our societies  will be characterized by insecurity.  Saint Lucia therefore looks forward to the high-level plenary meeting devoted to the follow-up to the outcome of the special session on children  to be convened in December to evaluate progress made in the implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action (resolution S-27/2  annex)  bearing in mind that several of the time-bound and quantified commitments should have already been met.  We in Saint Lucia will continue to spend a considerable amount of our resources on our children  and we hope that the international community will come to the aid of all those who recognize the future in children  providing for them an enabling environment for advancement through opportunity  safety  love and peace.

"100",4132,"LIE",62,2007,"Climate change  at the centre of the high-level event a week ago  constitutes one of the greatest challenges of our generation. It puts to the test our ability to create the collective political will necessary to counter a phenomenon of potentially disastrous socio-economic consequences. It also offers a great opportunity to make the best use of the unique framework that this Organization provides. The Bali meeting must bring about a long-term commitment by all States to launching an ambitious and practical road map towards a gradually decarbonized global economy. We can reach that goal if we translate today’s political momentum into concrete action that goes beyond tomorrow’s activities.   Climate change is but one of the areas of concern to the international community  where it is absolutely clear that the United Nations is today more than ever an indispensable Organization. It appears indeed that its unique nature and potential are more widely recognized and accepted today than they were until even very recently. In the words of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  the pendulum is swinging back in our favour. As a strong believer in multilateralism  we welcome that development.  However  as true friends of the United Nations  we must also continue to question the ability of the Organization to fully use its potential and to fulfil the purposes and principles of its Charter. Our record in the area of reform  two years after the 2005 World Summit  is mixed. We yet have to achieve certain institutional reforms  and the principle of the responsibility to protect must be translated into concrete action  such as in the case of the oppressive policies of the regime in Myanmar against its own population. Of course  however  reform of an organization with tasks as diverse and daunting as the United Nations is never concluded. We must always be prepared to make the adjustments that are necessary to improve its impact  its legitimacy and its efficiency. Today  such adjustments require a two-fold approach. On the one hand  we must strengthen its operational parts and  on the other hand  we must ground the work of the Organization more firmly in its origins  namely  the Charter of the United Nations. The demands in the area of peacekeeping are greater than ever before. That attests to the faith placed in the United Nations  but it also makes the deficiencies in the management of the Organization a more pressing issue. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was therefore right to propose changes to strengthen institutional support for the Organization’s field activities. We look forward to further progress in that respect  in particular in the area of procurement. We are not convinced that the lessons from the oil-for-food scandal  which has done great damage to the United Nations  have been fully absorbed  let alone fully translated into concrete action. We must also credibly improve the financial efficiency and accountability of the Organization. That will  in turn  allow us to present to our domestic constituencies the ever-increasing bills for peacekeeping operations.  All the strengthening of the operational and managerial capabilities of the United Nations will not change the fact that  operationally and financially  this is not a powerful Organization. Its budget will always pale in comparison to what a number of States spend on their defence budgets  to cite an obvious example. The genuine power and strength of the Organization lies in its foundation in international law. The Charter itself can be regarded as the greatest achievement in the history of international law. More important  though  the United Nations has the unique ability to bestow legitimacy and legality on international action. In the eyes of the world  the United Nations symbolizes the rule of law in international relations.   That is a tremendous asset that we must cherish and promote wherever possible. The United Nations and its organs must always be seen as the guardians of international law. Given its central place in the institutional architecture of the Organization  that applies in particular to the Security Council. The current practice of the Council with respect to the listing and de-listing of individuals targeted by sanctions is therefore a cause for concern. We believe that disregarding international standards of due process does nothing to improve the effectiveness of sanctions regimes  but much to undermine the authority of the Council itself.  Long years and much energy have been spent on the reform of the Security Council. It would appear today that we are as far from a solution as ever. We believe that the legitimacy of the Council’s actions has a number of sources  the most important of which are the quality of its decisions and the extent to which they reflect international law. In addition  the decisions of the Council have the necessary legitimacy if they are genuinely taken on behalf of the membership as a whole  and therefore also on behalf of the vast majority of States that do not serve on the Council. That can be achieved through greater involvement by non-member States  in particular if and when their interests are directly affected. Finally  of course  the membership of the Council must be more representative of the overall membership of the Organization  and of the developing world in particular.  The past few years have not brought about the era of the rule of law that some had hoped for. Quite to the contrary  there have been concerted  and ultimately unsuccessful  attacks on the importance of the rule of law in international relations. Nevertheless  we have achieved very significant progress in some areas  in particular in the area of international criminal justice. The Security Council has led the way through the establishment of international and hybrid tribunals. But the crowning success  of course  was the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC).   The referral of the situation in Darfur to the Court was a landmark decision  both legally and politically. It was a strong message by the Security Council that the international community does not accept impunity for the most serious crimes under international law. That message  however  needs to be backed up by enforcement action  in particular by the arrest of all indictees sought by the Court. We therefore call on all States and the United Nations to cooperate with the ICC to that end.  We will continue to take great interest in the work of the Security Council. At the same time  of course  we will focus our energy on making the General Assembly a more relevant and more essential part of the United Nations system. In that regard  my delegation looks forward to the President’s leadership and to closely cooperating with him on the priority issues he has identified. "
"101",4179,"LKA",62,2007,"I am pleased to be able to address the global community on the first day of the current session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Please accept my congratulations  Sir  on your assumption of the high office of the President of the sixty-second session. To Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  I wish to convey Sri Lanka’s gratitude for her astute leadership of the sixty-first session.  Sri Lanka can boast of a very old and advanced civilization  similar to Greek  Roman and Nile Valley civilizations. One of the important characteristics of our civilization is the use of living languages such as Sinhala and Tamil  two languages used by many even today. I therefore consider it my obligation to use Sinhala  a living language  to address the General Assembly.  Let me begin by quoting the immortal words of Sir Isaac Newton: “We build too many walls and not enough bridges”. We all became Members of an Organization that was created to let all our voices be heard and to avoid an approach aimed at resolving problems through violence  revenge and blame. Yet we see a trend to find fault  to place countries in the dock and penalize those who do not fall into line. Instead of seeking solutions through cooperation  we have often created suspicion and built walls between ourselves through double standards.  I am proud to inform the Assembly that  despite the significant challenge posed by the ongoing conflict with a ruthless terrorist group in the north of our country  we have freed the Eastern Province from terrorism and restored law and order there. My Government has already launched a massive programme of rehabilitation and reconstruction in the east. We propose to make the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka a model for development and rehabilitation  essentially through our own effort but also with the assistance of all donors. We are taking steps to return the usurped rights of the people by conducting provincial and local Government elections in the east early next year. There is a clear opportunity for the international community to play a vital role in breaking the cycle of conflict by focusing on development. We launched military operations only to exert pressure on terrorists in order to convince them that it would not be possible for them to obtain a military victory. Our goal remains a negotiated and honourable end to this unfortunate conflict. I must say that the All Party Representative Committee is working successfully towards it.  Sri Lanka was one of the first developing countries to promote universal health and education  gender equality and social mobilization. We have been able to achieve exceptional socio-economic indicators   way ahead of those normally expected of a country in the lower-middle income range   and are on the way to achieving or surpassing many of the Millennium Development Goals. It is a beautiful sight on our rural roads to see thousands of children in clean white uniforms heading for school. It is a fine example of our success in achieving education for all.  Despite 25 years of brutal terrorism  we have been able to continue with this social development. My Government maintains a policy of openness and cooperation with all international human rights mechanisms  and a number of high-level officials have visited Sri Lanka recently. Sri Lanka’s ancient civilization was rooted in the Buddhist principles of metta and ahimsa   metta being loving kindness to all living beings and ahimsa being a deep respect for life. Human rights have been an essential part of our great cultural tradition for millennia. It is therefore nothing new for us to protect human rights. Women in pre-colonial Sri Lanka enjoyed rights that are prescribed under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women   including rights of property ownership and inheritance rights. It was certainly no accident that Sri Lanka produced the first democratically elected woman Prime Minister in the world in 1960.  Guided by the principles of Buddhism  we have long respected the rights of our fellow human beings. It has therefore not been necessary for us to experience global wars or the deaths of millions to learn to recognize their value. My country has no record of inflicting misery on fellow human beings for the purpose of empire-building  for commercial advantage or for religious righteousness. Sri Lanka  as one of the founding members of the Human Rights Council  believes that human rights are too important to be used as a tool to victimize States for political advantage. It is essential that international action to facilitate compliance with human rights standards be fair and even-handed. Human rights have to be protected and advanced for their own sake  not for political gain.  Even as we are gathered here  State sovereignty  civil society and the rule of law are increasingly being threatened by terrorism and other illegal and illicit activities in many countries. We need to be vigilant about these activities. Although the United Nations system has set up mechanisms to deal with many of these problems  the capacity of the United Nations to address these challenges effectively has been brought into question. There are many Member States represented in the Assembly today that have first-hand experience of the havoc caused by brutish terrorism  which has stretched out its claws to many corners of the world to mar innocent lives. All terrorist attacks  whether in New York  Mumbai  Cairo  London or Colombo   are acts that threaten the democratic way of life  and must be condemned unreservedly.  Terrorism anywhere is terrorism. There is nothing good in terrorism. Sri Lanka has taken an up-front position in the global community’s efforts to deal with terrorism. We have become party to 11 of the 13 United Nations conventions for the suppression of various acts of terrorism. We think that the comprehensive convention on international terrorism   which  in our view  remains a priority   is a hostage to endless discussion. I emphasize that we must conclude those negotiations soon.  In whatever continent there are conflicts  those will affect the world economy. Peace in the Middle East would have a great impact on our economy. Solutions sought for conflicts in various countries must be indigenous. Otherwise  even if the international community is appeased  people in the countries saddled with conflicts will not be satisfied. That would be a blow to democracy. At this point  we must focus our attention on the Palestinians who are striving for an independent State. The world community must help them to manage their country without any undue influence.  We strongly support the strengthening of United Nations mechanisms for countering fund-raising for illegal and illicit activities. We encourage the Secretary-General to allocate more resources to this area  especially to enhance technical skills in countries that do not have such skills. Many developing countries would benefit from such assistance. We need to have a better mechanism to provide solutions to the problems confronting us. Support from all Member States should be obtained for this purpose.  The United Nations has a mixed record of achievements. As resources received by the United Nations are limited  it has been only possible to deliver limited results. We need to focus on these as they often have been characterized by countless  poorly coordinated  ineffectively designed  ineptly staffed and overlapping programmes  with unnecessary inter-agency competition. The United Nations must always remember that its primary function is to render assistance for the well-being of its Member States.  We have rounded the Development Decade declared by the General Assembly. My country has declared the “Mahinda Chintana” 10-year vision to usher in a new Sri Lanka in line with those goals. Through that we are committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We have accorded priority to the areas liberated from terrorism  those that have been devastated by natural disasters and rural areas lagging behind in development. However  it is a huge challenge for us to fill the gap created by the loss of human lives arising out of disasters.  We are implementing a rural development initiative based on Maga Neguma  the road development programme  and “Gama Neguma”  the rural reawakening programme and a national infrastructure development initiative. The “Mahinda Chintana” 10-year development vision includes continuous qualitative upgrading of education and health programmes in all areas  livelihood initiatives for low-income groups  and broad social welfare programmes covering poor and disadvantaged members of society  aimed specially at children and women. We also implement programmes to protect our people from narcotic drugs and diseases transmitted through social contact.  The working population  as well as low-income and poor groups in developing countries such as ours  face tough challenges due to escalating world oil prices and increases in the prices of essential food items. Similarly  we are severely affected by natural disasters and uncertainties in the world financial markets. For those reasons  it has become a challenge to achieve the Millennium Development Goals declared by the Assembly.  The World Bank  established for economic development  the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  which was set up for financial stability  and other regional banks established at the same time as this world organization  all need to implement new programmes to assist the countries affected by these challenges. Priority must be given to providing resources for this purpose.  I believe that our obligation as global leaders at these sessions of the General Assembly  is to commit ourselves to programmes that will eradicate terrorism  establish human-welfare-oriented development  establish democracy and ensure there is hope for low-income groups for economic development. Accordingly  I appeal to the global community to make the sixty-second session the beginning of a new chapter  rather than just another session. "
"102",4221,"LSO",62,2007,"My delegation associates itself with the compliments extended to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to preside over the General Assembly at this session and to his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain. I also wish to take this opportunity to welcome His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to assure him of my country’s unconditional support during his tenure as Secretary-General of the United Nations.  Lesotho congratulates the presidency on having invited Member States to comment on the theme “Responding to Climate Change” during this session. In 1992  the first Earth Summit  the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  was held in Rio de Janeiro. It was at that conference that we committed ourselves to achieving sustainable development in the twenty-first century. We reaffirmed our commitments in Johannesburg at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development. It would seem that  for far too long thereafter  we agreed to disagree until we were confronted by the glaring and compelling scientific evidence that the link between global warming and human activities was unequivocal. We waited for the adverse effects of climate change to begin to be felt all over the globe before we could acknowledge that consensus was essential for concerted action on climate change.  Sadly  natural disasters have begun to strike. As is usually the case  it is the poorest nations and the most vulnerable countries that are being worst affected. My country is one of these. Unfavourable climatic conditions that are attributable to climate change have led to severe drought  which has resulted in acute food shortages. In order to address that crisis  my Government has declared a state of emergency on food security.  As the world prepares for the United Nations climate change conference  which will take place in Bali  Indonesia  in December 2007  we need to be reminded of the urgent need to build a solid and sustainable consensus on a global response to climate change for the period following the expiry of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol in the year 2012. My delegation calls upon the international community to endeavour to reach consensus on  among other things  steps that must be taken to reach the 60 to 80 per cent emission cuts that are required to stabilize the atmosphere. In that regard  the industrialized countries must assume the major responsibility  because scientific evidence has confirmed that it is the greenhouse gas emissions from those countries that are making natural disasters worse. The international community must also reaffirm its commitment to assisting the regions  such as Africa  that are the most vulnerable to climate change. In addition  my delegation calls upon developed countries to assist developing countries in strengthening their capacity to adapt to climate change.  Allow us further to share our thoughts on what we consider to be the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century. Our thoughts cover three areas: democracy  conflicts and development.   The United Nations was formed against the backdrop of colonialism  particularly on the African continent. As colonial rule slowly but surely ended  it left behind a legacy of undemocratic Governments. African countries were characterized by coups d’état day in  day out. Very few African countries have not had the “pleasure” of military rule.  Faced with that disturbing reality  some regional organizations adopted instruments to deal with unconstitutional changes of Government by carrying out sanctions. Here  mention should be made of the Organization of African Unity; its successor  the African Union; and the Commonwealth group of nations. Significantly  however  our Organization  the United Nations  has not adopted any instrument to carry out sanctions against defaulting Member States. That is what the United Nations must now do.  Today  the overwhelming majority of the world’s countries adhere to the principles of democracy. Those countries hold periodic elections. However  the broadest common denominator of developing countries is the non-acceptance of election results; it has become a tradition for losing political parties to dispute them. Regrettably  that is done through unlawful means more often than not  despite the fact that there are always lawful mechanisms for challenging election results. This is one area in which we see a role for the United Nations  as the universal institution with the capacity necessary to assist requesting Member States in reversing these trends.  Just as the United Nations plays a critical role in world economic development  it should see as part of its role aggressively inculcating the culture of democracy in all nations. In particular  the Organization must help developing countries fight the culture of impunity. The common understanding must be a simple one: “When the people have spoken  respect their voice”. Victors must learn to accept victory with humility and magnanimity  and losers to accept defeat with grace. In that way  the post-election period can be devoted to development  with all sides joining hands in a collective national effort. We must hasten to acknowledge the role that the United Nations is now playing in democratization processes  but we feel that it can do more.  That brings us to the second area: conflicts. Conflicts always feature prominently in our addresses before the Assembly. We must acknowledge that inter-State conflicts are on the decline across the globe. The same  however  cannot be said about internal conflicts. It cannot be denied that intra-State conflicts occur where there is little or no regard for democratic governance. If a country is not accustomed to holding elections or to accepting election results  conflicts arise. Other causes  which are also attributable to lack of democratic governance  include a lack of judicious sharing of a country’s wealth  rampant poverty and ethnic strife.  In all such conflicts  small arms and light weapons have become weapons of choice. We therefore still consider it regrettable that in the year 2005  Member States were not able to adopt a legally binding international instrument on the marking and tracing of small arms and light weapons. We share the view that such an instrument could curtail the production  transfer and civilian possession of illicit small arms and light weapons. It is the urgent responsibility of the United Nations to facilitate the adoption of an effective international instrument for curbing the illicit trade in conventional weapons  which would make it harder for such weapons to end up in the hands of criminals. We hope that the arms trade treaty that is being proposed can be concluded expeditiously.  We must recall that in the year 2005  the Assembly solemnly proclaimed that the role of the entire international community  acting through the United Nations  was to protect populations from genocide  war crimes and other crimes against humanity. Unfortunately  that is not what is happening on the ground. We still notice inaction on the part of the Security Council  or its reaction coming too late. The harrowing experiences of Rwanda and now Darfur are living testimony to that. We attribute such inaction to the skewed composition and powers of the Council  especially the right of veto  which we are now convinced  more than ever before  is extremely subjective and exercised according to the interests of the concerned permanent member. That has  in some instances  caused a breaking of the ranks among the big five. We continue to witness unilateral economic and financial blockades being imposed against other countries  and the denial to peoples of their right to self-determination  while others are still subject to occupation. Cuba  Palestine and the Western Sahara are here cases in point. We submit that it must remain the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century to proactively preserve international peace and security. Our call is therefore that  where peace and security are threatened  the United Nations  through the Security Council  must act swiftly and decisively at all times.  But the United Nations can do so only if its structures are reformed to make them democratic and representative. Our basic premise would continue to be that the United Nations in the twenty-first century should inculcate democracy not only in Member countries  but also within itself.  It is a hard fact that the reform of the United Nations will not be complete without the reform of the Security Council. Members of this body have on several occasions reiterated the fact that the Security Council in its current form does not reflect the realities of today’s world  and yet  for more than a decade now  the Assembly has remained stagnant on that issue. The presentation per se of various positions by major stakeholders  as well as various attempts to bridge major differences in those positions  have thus far failed to produce tangible results. Hence  my delegation shares the view that it is now time to move forward and begin intergovernmental negotiations. However  we wish to underline that  while the reform of the Security Council is possible  all Member States need to garner the necessary political will to attain that goal. The credibility of the Council is at stake.  Sustainable world peace and stability create the necessary space to deal with the development challenges of our countries and peoples. The world has acknowledged that the HIV and AIDS pandemic represents the top most challenge. The untold miseries brought about by that scourge are common cause. To the extent that no cure is available  HIV/AIDS will continue to be a threat to human existence. That threat  particularly in Africa  is compounded by worsening poverty and famine levels brought about  in most cases  by unfavourable weather conditions  compliments   in large measure  of climate change.  It is our view that  in a country enjoying political stability  the potential for all sectors of that nation to address those challenges is greatly enhanced. Moreover  no economic development can take place without democracy  peace and stability. Of course  the support of the developed countries will always be called for; hence  the need for them to fulfil their promise on official development assistance  which plays such a critical role in the economic development of the developing countries.  My delegation congratulates the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on his commitment to the strengthening of the Organization. For this Organization to acquit itself successfully in the twenty-first century  the role of its Secretary-General must remain sacrosanct. He must remain immune to influence by the interests of any groups or Powers. He must be faithful to the interests of all in the service of our family of nations. Above all  he must help  through the United Nations  to create a world at peace with itself. "
"103",4247,"LTU",62,2007,"It is always inspiring to come to this forum and  time and again  observe that there are many more things that unite rather than divide nations around the globe. Indeed  we are united in our vision of a world free of violence  where every individual has freedom of choice and where human dignity is respected. We are united in our aspirations to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century  because we know that in a globalized world a threat to one nation is a threat to all nations.  Nowhere is this new reality more evident than in the much-needed work of the United Nations. Poverty  imbalances in development  armaments  the spread of ideologies of hatred  cybercrime: those are some of the threats that we face today. The new  daunting challenges are different in kind. Therefore  both individual States and the international community have to find ways to deal with this new reality and how to respond better to new challenges.  Seven years ago  at this United Nations conclave  all nations made a historic step  pledging to eradicate poverty  illiteracy and environmental degradation  and to improve health and promote gender equality. That was our response to the challenges of the time. This year  we are halfway to the 2015 deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Over the past few years  an estimated 135 million people managed to get out of extreme poverty. Significant positive changes are taking place in the fields of primary education for poor children  child vaccination and better access to retroviral treatment for persons with HIV/AIDS  to name but a few.  Yet overall progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals remains uneven and too slow. If we want to live up to our commitments  we must increase our efforts considerably and urgently.  The twenty-first century has also confronted us with such challenges as a deteriorating environment. Global warming affects all aspects of our lives from social and economic growth to changing habitats and migration patterns. Time is clearly not on our side. We are taking measures to adapt our policies to counter climate change  but our actions are obviously too slow and sometimes too reluctant. Therefore  Lithuania welcomes the Secretary-General’s focus on climate change as a global challenge that requires global concerted efforts. We believe that the United Nations climate change process is the appropriate forum for negotiating future global action in this effort.  But that already may not be enough. I am convinced that the world needs a more coherent and inclusive system of international environmental governance. This system needs to be strengthened by establishing a United Nations Environment Organization  based on the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) with a revised mandate. With December’s Bali climate change conference in mind  I call on all countries to come to the negotiating table later this year with the ambition of concluding by 2009 a global and comprehensive post-2012 agreement. Before such an agreement is reached  Lithuania is doing its best to fulfil the commitment of the European Union to achieve at least a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.  We have started to focus on a wider use of indigenous and renewable energy resources. The share of these resources in the primary energy balance in Lithuania will increase up to 12 per cent by the year 2010. Last year alone  we planted 21 000 hectares of trees  an area that corresponds to 32 000 soccer fields. For a country the size of Lithuania  that is no small measure. These are but a few of the concrete steps by which my country shows political will sufficient to fight new global challenges.  The necessity to fit in and effectively integrate into the international system has been the cornerstone of our policies since we regained our independence in 1990. Membership in the European Union and NATO is the best example of success in that effort. Now we are taking on increasing responsibility in the fields of security  stability and sustainability in our region and beyond. We are active at the front of the war against terrorism  including our contribution to restoring stability and security in Iraq. We are leading a Provincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan’s Ghor province. Over the past two years  Lithuania has doubled its development aid budget and has committed to increasing it to 0.33 per cent of its gross national income by 2015. Our contribution to global security and the vision of inclusiveness and of building a “Europe whole and free” motivated Lithuania to offer its candidacy for the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2010.  If Lithuania and the Baltic region in general are a success story in terms of establishing themselves in a new global environment  some countries in our region are not. We may only guess why those countries perceive the integration of democracies on their borders as a national threat. We feel sorry for a society at large when its Government chooses to spend the country’s natural riches on guns and not on democratic reforms. Clearly  we should not tolerate attempts to falsify historical facts about the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States or the denial of the deliberately caused Holodomor in Ukraine  which killed millions.  Fitting in is never easy. Therefore  we consider that the United Nations could help Member States to efficiently integrate into the international system  as the European Union is already doing by engaging its neighbours in this process through various neighbourhood instruments and cooperation formats.  However  our readiness to stand up and speak openly to States if they cross the line is also an indispensable element of that effort. We should ask ourselves: where did we fail  that the killings of hundreds of thousands of innocent people were permitted to take place in Darfur?   Today conflicts occur on every continent  with particularly grave consequences in Africa and the Middle East. Some conflicts in the world  however  are less visible. But that does not make them less dangerous. Frozen conflicts in Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus may become very hot one day unless we act immediately. We consider it morally unacceptable for the international community to remain indifferent to the frozen conflicts in the GUAM area. Let us not forget that it is not only the conflicts that are frozen; the lives and dreams of the people living in those areas of artificial conflict are also frozen. That is where the United Nations should be more visible and more outspoken. That also applies to Kosovo  where attempts to create another frozen conflict must be excluded.  It is not only States  but also the United Nations itself that must adapt to new  changing realities. We encourage the Secretary-General to continue the reform of the United Nations  in particular making the Organization’s operational system more consolidated  coherent and effective  with the highest standards of conduct and ethics. We must proceed with real actions in carrying through the reform of the United Nations. The Secretary-General has my full support in this context. He should be applauded for his bold and forward-thinking vision of the reform in United Nations peacekeeping. We welcome all efforts by the United Nations to streamline and reform the peacekeeping procurement system.  I encourage the United Nations to further strengthen  develop and use its capabilities in the area of good offices and conflict prevention  as envisioned in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). That would enable us to address many issues in a more efficient manner and  hopefully  to avoid costly peacekeeping operations.  The prevention of nuclear proliferation and the pursuit of nuclear disarmament in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are crucial for global peace and security. We need to strengthen the authority of the Treaty. Lithuania will support the process leading to the elaboration of a binding international arms trade treaty. Lithuania will also continue to increase practical assistance and funding to international mine action projects and the implementation of the Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons.  Two years have passed since the adoption of the World Summit Outcome  which elaborated on the concept of the responsibility to protect  and yet we have been too slow in responding to massive violations of human rights and mass atrocities. The principle of the responsibility to protect can no longer be confined to paper. We therefore encourage the Secretary-General to follow up on the World Summit document and take measures to operationalize that principle.  Only a reformed and proactive United Nations will be truly instrumental and effective. Only such a United Nations will have the required support and financing. Only such a United Nations will be trusted by the people.  The ability to adapt is the quality of the strong. Fitting in is the least we can do for future generations. It is the responsibility of every nation and the international community as such.  "
"104",4291,"LUX",62,2007,"Year after year the international community meets in New York in September to debate the major issues of concern to humankind. This traditional encounter is of special importance in that it enables us to grasp very directly and intensively  in all their complexity  the challenges that confront us  but also to bolster our determination to search for common solutions. That is the very essence of the effective multilateralism that  with great conviction  my country  Luxembourg  has placed at the heart of its international action.  And what could be a stronger illustration of this shared perception of what is at stake globally and this resolve to seek viable solutions in the short  medium and long  even very long  term than the high-level event organized at the beginning of the week at the initiative of the Secretary-General devoted to the problems of climate change?  As already said on behalf of the European Union by the Prime Minister of Portugal whose statement I fully support  it is essential that December's Bali negotiations on an effective and viable post-Kyoto regime get off to a successful start. That is our most basic responsibility vis-a-vis present and future generations. For its part  as a member of the European Union and a State party to the Kyoto Protocol  Luxembourg  which has already undertaken weighty individual commitments  is ready to engage with great resolve in the quest for innovative and bold solutions.  In order to address successfully the problems of climate change  we must tackle them in all their complexity. In this regard  it should be noted that in the absence of concerted and energetic international action  there is a great risk that countries and populations that have contributed the least to the emergence of this phenomenon are likely to be the ones to bear the heaviest adverse consequences.  This  as I see it  is a political problem and  I would say  a moral problem   of the first order. More than ever  the issue of development and hence of sustainable development both in the North and in the South must remain in the forefront of international attention. Important decisions have already been taken. Here  I would refer in particular to the decision taken by the European Union in 2005 under the Luxembourg presidency to attain the objective of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance (ODA) by 2015. Faced with the risk of stagnation in ODA  we must redouble our efforts to meet our commitments.  A member of this all-too select Groupwith ODA that in 2007 reached close to 0.9 per cent of gross national income  and looking forward to achieving the objective of 1 per cent that we have set for ourselves   Luxembourg can only look forward to the expansion of this club.  The year that lies ahead is crucial from the standpoint of development. There will be a need to undertake resolutely  and in a way that seeks a convergence  the World Trade Organization trade negotiations  the follow-up to Monterrey in the area of financing for development  and the implementation of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Only if we adopt generous and courageous policies will we be able to build on these advances and reduce the delays that unfortunately persist  particularly in a number of sub-Saharan African countries  with regard to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  The convening in 2008 of a high-level meeting on mid-term implementation of the Millennium Development Goals would undoubtedly be a good opportunity to take stock and relaunch our efforts. Here I would also applaud the recent establishment at the initiative of the Secretary-General of the Millennium Development Goals Africa Steering Group. I am convinced that this will make a significant contribution in terms of coordination and intensification of efforts vis-à-vis a continent with which Luxembourg maintains relations of intense and multifaceted cooperation.  The problems associated with climate change and sustainable development bring me to another subject that is dear to my heart and is at the core of the international activities of the Luxembourg Government: humanitarian action. When it first discussed the question of climate change (see S/PV.5663)  the Security Council highlighted the numerous complex interactions that could exist among natural disasters  the stepping up of violent conflicts within and among States and humanitarian disasters in various parts of the world. We must tackle these emergency situations on the operational level  seeking to make our action as efficient and prompt as possible. But there is also a need increasingly to place these emergency situations in their political  socio-economic and cultural context in order to try to mitigate their effects and  as far as possible  to prevent recurrence.  It is from this standpoint that a new Luxembourg Government strategy in the area of humanitarian crisis management has recently been presented. The strategy that rests on three pillars: emergency relief; rehabilitation and reconstruction in the transitional phase; and prevention.  On the basis of the United Nations finding that one euro invested in prevention may make it possible to save eight euros in crisis response and resolution  nearly 5 per cent of the Luxembourg humanitarian budget will henceforth be devoted to a proactive  preventive approach.  The 2005 World Summit Outcome  which is more than ever the road map for international action  stressed the fundamental finding according to which  “development  peace and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. For my part  I believe that this is a cardinal principle that should guide and inspire all action by the United Nations and its Member States from an overall standpoint of coherence in addressing the great problems of the time: conflicts in Africa   and I am thinking particularly of the situations with tragic humanitarian consequences currently prevailing in the Sudan  Somalia  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and  to be sure  Zimbabwe; the Middle East  where it is important to support fully ongoing Israeli and Palestinian efforts and to progress ultimately towards a negotiated solution of two States living side by side in peace and security  and also towards a lasting solution for the whole region; and Afghanistan  Burma/Myanmar and other hotbeds of violence and instability. There is no denying that we must take into account simultaneously the dimensions of peace and security  human rights  States rights  the rule of law and socio-economic development.  I would like now to speak of the courage of the Burmese monks and other citizens who for weeks have been peacefully expressing their aspiration to democracy and respect for human rights. I condemn most energetically the violence of the Burmese security forces against these peaceful demonstrators and call the authorities to put an end to it.  The imperative that I mentioned a moment ago can also be seen very clearly in the work of a new and innovative organ  of which Luxembourg has been a member since the beginning of the year: the Peacebuilding Commission. The integrated peacebuilding strategies for each of the countries concerned should take into account all the factors involved in order once and for all to break the cycles of violence and place those countries on a stable track towards development. I would like also to mention in this context the essential dimension of reconciliation and combating impunity and to applauding in particular the activities of the various international courts  in particular the International Criminal Court.  The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the key focuses of Luxembourg’s foreign policy. I continue to place great hope in the new Human Rights Council  which has just finished setting up its institutional structures  including  in particular  the universal periodic review mechanism  which is a significant innovation.  Faithful to its convictions and commitments  my country fully associates itself with the initiatives announced by a group of States from all parts of the world aimed at making progress in the international debate on the question of abolishing the death penalty.  In this rapid overview of the international situation in the area of peace and security  allow me to linger for a moment on an important issue that is of such concern to both the United Nations and the European Union  namely Kosovo. The last act of the Yugoslav tragedy  an urgent solution for the Kosovo issue must be found. The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General  President Ahtisaari  has been working energetically to establish  in keeping with the established guidelines  the basis of the future status of Kosovo. The Troika of representatives from the European Union  the United States and Russia is also committed to a final attempt to bring the two parties together. These efforts have been continued in recent days in New York. As members know  the parties are even now meeting in this building; I have high hopes that dialogue will ensue. The Troika has agreed to submit its report to the Secretary-General by 10 December. I reiterate that the European Union is ready to fully assume its responsibilities in the region  for which a European future lies ahead.  I turn my attention to another issue that is of concern to international public opinion and whose potential impact on peace and security is very worrisome: the area of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. A few days ago  I had the opportunity to state the views of the Luxembourg Government at the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. Here at the General Assembly I advocate once again for continued efforts in the area of nuclear disarmament and a strengthening of the non-proliferation regime  of which the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is and should remain the keystone.  I would also like to speak briefly about other types of arms with destabilizing effects or unacceptable consequences for civilians; small arms and light weapons and sub-munitions. I hope that significant advances may soon be made  on those two categories of weapons in particular. The Luxembourg Government for its part intends to participate actively in this debate and is currently preparing a bill forbidding the manufacture  storage  utilization and trade in weapons employing sub-munitions.  The quest for international disarmament and the strengthening of international regimes on weapons of mass destruction consistently remain objectives of the Luxembourg Government  because of the serious concern we feel as we observe certain current developments with regard to respect for existing international norms  in particular with reference to the Iranian issue.  While the agreement that has just been concluded between the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency   specifically Mr. ElBaradei   and the Islamic Republic of Iran goes in the right direction  we note with concern that Iran has not yet taken the necessary measures to bring itself into conformity with the three relevant resolutions of the Security Council. I appeal to Iran finally to take that action and to suspend all activities linked to enrichment.  On the set of issues that I have just mentioned  the Charter has entrusted a central role to the Security Council. It is essential for the Council to adapt to the political realities of the beginning of the twenty-first century by enlarging its membership in the categories of permanent and non-permanent members  guaranteeing an appropriate place for the small States that represent the vast majority of States Members of the Organization. It is important also to modernize the Council’s functioning for the sake of enhanced effectiveness and transparency  with broader involvement for the entire membership. On the basis of the consensus decision that was adopted at the end of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly (see A/61/PV.109)  I venture to hope that significant progress will be achieved in the area of Security Council reform in months to come. My country is eager to make its contribution to the achievement of the purposes of the Charter and to shoulder its share of responsibility in international peace and security  and thus wishes to become   for the first time since it placed its signature on the San Francisco Charter in 1945   a non-permanent member of the Security Council for 2013 and 2014.  Security Council reform is an important portion of the United Nations reform agenda outlined at the 2005 Summit. If recourse to a multilateral machinery  with the United Nations at its core  is to be credible  then the tool made available to the international community must be commensurate with the developments of our time and capable of responding adequately to the expectations of efficiency and effectiveness harboured by States and peoples worldwide.  The reform effort should be pursued and supported with conviction by a revitalized General Assembly  exercising its prerogatives with energy and discernment and achieving its priority objectives. Reform  and thus the modernization of multilateralism  can succeed only if it rests on the common will of all Member States.  That applies in particular to the field of system-wide coherence in operational activities. To overcome the fragmentation that has developed over more than 60 years of United Nations history  to restore to the system and its actors a more effective capacity for action  particularly at the level of the countries and populations concerned  and to strengthen operational coherence in the eight areas covered by the report of the High-level Panel (A/61/583) are primary objectives for the performance and thus the credibility of the United Nations system. They are also decisions that need to be taken courageously and proactively in the appropriate forums.  While the success of reform would be reflected in a win-win-win situation for donor countries  recipient countries and the United Nations as a whole  as Mr. Ban Ki-moon has rightly said  the failure of reform would be likely to marginalize the entire system over the long term. The choice is before us; we must shoulder our political responsibilities.  More than ever  effective multilateralism is a great hope of our populations aspiring to a more just  more peaceful and more prosperous world  where the great ecological balance is preserved and where every man and every woman can live in dignity and in full enjoyment of his or her human rights. Let us not disappoint that expectation.   And let us remember this very wise saying from the Roman philosopher Seneca: It is not because it is difficult that we do not dare to do it; it is because we do not dare to do it that it is difficult. "
"105",4317,"LVA",62,2007,"I wish to begin by congratulating you  Mr. Kerim  on your assumption of the post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. Your wise and energetic leadership will reflect the abilities of the people of your country and of our region as a whole. I also wish to congratulate and extend my best wishes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and to pledge him my full support. It is evident that the Secretary-General recognizes the multitude of challenges the world is facing today. Only two days ago  I took part in the high-level meeting on climate change here at the United Nations. That meeting was organized by the Secretary-General to highlight the urgent need for decisions that will prevent long-term negative consequences. Now we must all work together towards achieving a satisfactory outcome to the Bali Conference  which is to be held at the end of this year.  I welcome the fact that the Security Council was able to adopt the groundbreaking resolution 1769 (2007)  which authorized the deployment of the Hybrid Operation in Darfur. It is now imperative that the resolution be translated into reality. We all recognize the difficulties involved. It is also imperative to continue the political process. Only a negotiated solution has the potential to bring sustainable peace to that long-suffering region.  To a great extent  the stability and prosperity of Iraq depend on support from its region. We therefore welcome the fact that the Security Council could unite to adopt resolution 1770 (2007). That resolution gives a renewed and strengthened mandate to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. With the launch of the International Compact with Iraq  last May  the world community now possesses an effective instrument for rendering further assistance to the areas in Iraq where it is most needed. The Compact has already been used to achieve positive results. We encourage the Government of Iraq to continue to take steps towards promoting economic reform and achieving peace and stability for its people.  Just a couple of weeks ago  I visited Afghanistan. I had a chance to meet with President Karzai  representatives of the Afghan Government  Latvian troops and civilian experts. The message from all those meetings was clear. Providing assistance through the International Security Assistance Force is just one side of the coin; the other entails contributing to building a solid foundation for the country’s sustainable development.   Latvia is present in Afghanistan as part of both the international military and the civilian rebuilding effort. Latvia’s Government is contributing financially to the reconstruction of infrastructure in Afghanistan. However  it is my strong conviction that the key to success in Afghanistan is cooperation   cooperation among countries and international organizations. To succeed  the European Union  the United Nations  NATO and others must adopt a comprehensive  long-term approach to development assistance for the country.  In the Middle East  the past year has brought no significant breakthrough. Yet  we continue to place our trust in the work of the Quartet  which supports the efforts of responsible regional States in helping to calm the situation. It is a crucial tool to promote a negotiated  comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East  in line with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. I am sure that the Quartet’s newly appointed Special Envoy will use his great experience and make sincere efforts to fulfil his challenging mandate.  The international community is currently also seized of the matter regarding the final status of Kosovo. The Secretary-General has endorsed the Comprehensive Proposal of his Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari. The Proposal currently remains the only viable diplomatic solution on the table. The active involvement of the European Union is important to achieve a lasting solution. We urge both parties to show flexibility and commitment to a peaceful negotiated outcome. We sincerely hope that the ongoing talks under the auspices of the Contact Group troika will result in success.  In my previous capacity as a surgeon  I performed many operations. But I also closely followed the recovery process of every one of my patients. I ensured that they got the necessary post-operative treatment and encouraged them to maintain healthy habits. In that phase I had to rely heavily on the work of my able and dedicated team. Likewise  it is not enough for the Security Council to prescribe peacekeeping operations  crucial as they are for international peace and security. The whole United Nations system is necessary for the long-term recovery of conflict zones.   In that regard  I would like to pay special tribute to the peacekeepers and to the United Nations staff working in difficult conditions on the ground. It is our duty in our capitals  and here at United Nations Headquarters  to support their efforts  each Member State according to its capacity. At the same time  we expect high standards in peacekeeping forces.  For many decades  Latvia suffered extensively from foreign occupation. Now that we have regained our freedom  we hope to prevent the suffering of others. We wish to promote the healing process. The international community must bring to justice those who have committed war crimes and massive violations of human rights. Latvia commends the work of the International Criminal Court. We have placed our hopes in the Peacebuilding Commission   that it will be an effective tool for consolidating long-term peace.  Even where military conflict is not a factor  human security in many parts of the world is undermined by poverty  hunger and disease. The 2007 Millennium Development Goals Report gave us some good news. However  it warned us that the Goals will not be achieved by the year 2015   certainly not in sub-Saharan Africa   unless our efforts are scaled up. Latvia therefore supports the call to review progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and accelerate action.  Latvia is a candidate in the 2010 elections for the Economic and Social Council. We have know-how to share  and we also have empathy for the pain that reforms may cause. As an emerging donor  we have undertaken commitments in the area of overseas development assistance. We believe that our recent intensive and successful experience in development will be an asset to the work of the Council.  Latvia has a strong commitment to multilateralism and the values embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. We want to see an Organization that embodies effectiveness  efficiency and authority. It is regrettable that the reform process launched at the 2005 World Summit has been slow and uneven. We recognize the forces that make the reform so difficult  but we must not give in to fatigue and frustration. Management reform is vital. I already mentioned the dire necessity for a comprehensive approach among the different international players on the ground. Likewise  there is a great need for system-wide coherence of the various United Nations funds and programmes. The provision of aid should be targeted and efficient. Our focus should be on those in need. We look forward to assessing the results of the “One UN” pilot programme  which is now under way in eight volunteer countries.  The beginnings of the new Human Rights Council were a cause for concern. Still  we are confident that after making important decisions on institution-building earlier this year  Member States will take full advantage of the Human Rights Council. We have to live up to our task to further promote and protect human rights. The Council now has the tools  but it will be up to Member States to use those tools. It will be up to Member States to advance the credibility of the United Nations as an Organization able and willing to protect and promote human rights.   Latvia has always placed the promotion of human rights among its top priorities. In the light of that commitment  we have decided to aim for membership in the Human Rights Council in the 2014 elections.  No reform will be more difficult or more significant than that of the Security Council. The Security Council has had many achievements. However  we share the widespread belief that the composition and the working methods of the Council need to be brought up to date. We have stated many times our reasons for supporting the model of reform being promoted by the G4 nations  namely  Brazil  Germany  India  and Japan. We consider it to be the best of the models currently available. We welcome the prospect of intergovernmental negotiations beginning in the current session and hope that they will produce early positive results.  The United Nations is as important as ever  being the only truly universal forum for global dialogue. We must not forget that it is also the only truly universal forum for decision-making and action. But above all  we must emphasize that this is the forum where all States  big and small  have a voice. This is also a forum where all States have a responsibility to contribute.   Latvia looks forward to a fruitful sixty-second session of the General Assembly. "
"106",4364,"MAR",62,2007,"I  should like at the outset to express heartfelt congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its present session  as well as my best wishes for every success during your tenure. I also wish to thank Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her constructive and tireless efforts during her remarkable and fruitful presidency at the previous session  which was a source of pride for her country  Bahrain  and for the international community.   As this is the first session of the General Assembly under our newly appointed Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  I should like to reaffirm  on behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco  our full confidence in and support for his tireless efforts and good offices aimed at enabling the United Nations to attain its lofty objectives and to fulfil the aspirations of all nations. It is our hope that  at the dawn of the third millennium  a more just and effective world system can emerge  enabling nations to achieve collective peace and sustainable development.   Our session takes place at the eve of the celebration by the United Nations of the sixtieth anniversary of two important historical events that have marked its activities  forged its identity and proved its added value and its outstanding contribution to strengthening international cooperation  protecting human dignity and consolidating world peace and security. These events are the General Assembly’s adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the deployment of the first United Nations peacekeeping operation in that same year. In this context  it is appropriate to pause and take stock of what has been done in these two vital areas  and to outline the work objectives of our Organization in order to develop and optimize our common assets in a complex international melieu.   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights laid the foundations of international consensus regarding universal values and subsequently contributed to international efforts for the codification  protection and respect of basic cultural  social  economic and political rights. To this end  the international community is invited  through the United Nations  to take concrete measures to implement the provisions of this Declaration and give effect to confirm concretely its political and legal values.   In that connection  His Majesty King Mohammed VI stated in a royal address on 9 December 1999 that among the appropriate means of ensuring respect for human rights was the commitment to the relevant international covenants and the setting up of mechanisms for respecting and safeguarding these rights. He added that those legal and institutional instruments were  however  insufficient if respect for human rights was not part of standard conduct at all levels  or if  in other words  it did not become a shared culture.  The Kingdom of Morocco has embarked  under His Majesty’s enlightened leadership  on a thorough and ambitious process of political openness  human development and social modernization. In parallel  it is willing to participate in constructive international efforts aimed at establishing world consensus on human rights concepts  so that they no longer constitute a source of conflict and confrontation but are rather a motive for cooperation and consultation. Those concepts should not remain mere universal values but should become a reality  taking into consideration the diversity and indivisibility of human rights.   In this regard  the Kingdom of Morocco proposed last March  in the Human Rights Council  the adoption of a universal declaration on training and education in the culture of human rights  whose objective would be to consolidate and reinforce the values  principles and concepts of human rights by all international social components  so that they become a daily concern and a responsible practice. Morocco hopes that this proposal will be supported by all States  so that it may constitute a valuable contribution to the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human rights.   Peacekeeping operations are a key element of the activities of the United Nations  embodying the collective security principle that is one of the pillars of the United Nations Charter. Thanks to this mechanism  the United Nations has displayed a great capacity to adapt to change and has been able to participate in a direct and effective manner in the reinforcement of international peace.   The importance of peacekeeping operations has increased with the evolution of the traditional concept and the accumulation of tasks  which are no longer limited to peacekeeping per se. These tasks have also broadened in scope to encompass assistance to States undergoing reconstruction or engaged in the implementation of transitional justice  the consolidation of human rights  or good governance.  In this respect  the Kingdom of Morocco has been a pioneer in United Nations peacekeeping efforts  sending since 1960 more than 50 000 Blue Helmets to 13 peacekeeping operations across four continents. Thanks to their sacrifice and determination to uphold the principles of the United Nations  the Royal Armed Forces  along with the other peacekeeping troops  helped the United Nations to win the Nobel Peace prize.   In view of its cumulative experience and field expertise  the Kingdom of Morocco believes that it is high time to examine ways and means of reinforcing the legal basis and organizational framework of peacekeeping operations  while taking into consideration the changes undergone by this United Nations mechanism  as well as the need for improvement of the deployment conditions and work arrangements of its personnel.   Accordingly  the Kingdom of Morocco proposes the organization next year of a high-level meeting to examine this issue in all its aspects  with a view to adopting recommendations for the development of new norms and work arrangements that will ensure the success of peacekeeping operations.   Despite its efforts  Africa still faces major security challenges and significant difficulties in improving the health and living conditions of its citizens. Given its deep-rooted African identity and its profound historical  human and cultural ties with African States  the Kingdom of Morocco has  as directed by His Majesty the King  made its relations with the continent one of the priorities of its foreign policy. These relations are based on the principles of mutual respect  active solidarity  fruitful cooperation and constructive involvement in the regional initiatives and international strategies related to the continent.  Besides participating in development programmes aimed at effectively revitalizing South-South cooperation and undertaking numerous solidarity activities with African States victims of natural disasters  the Kingdom of Morocco hosted the first African Conference on Human Development  held in April 2007 in Rabat in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme. The Conference created an opportunity to establish a complementary strategy to meet the particular needs of Africa in the context of achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  In this regard  the Rabat Declaration on human development and the plan of action and recommendations of the Conference  constitute a framework of reference for the holding next year of a high-level meeting on Africa and development  as proposed by Morocco. Likewise  the conclusions of the Rabat Conference could contribute significantly to the work of the World Millennium Development Goals summit to be held next year in response to a proposal made by the United Kingdom Prime Minister.   Morocco expresses the hope that the Secretary-General’s next report on the causes of conflicts and the promotion of peace and sustainable development in Africa will contain practical recommendations and a clear political vision aimed at the reinforcement of stability  peace and security on the African continent  the consolidation of democracy and human rights  respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of African States  and the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the principle of good neighbourliness.  The Moroccan Sahara issue  one of the longest regional disputes in Africa  is at a historical turning point as a result of the launching of the Manhassett negotiations between the parties to the dispute  held under United Nations auspices. This turning point results from the dynamic created by the Moroccan autonomy plan for Moroccan Shara  a plan which has opened promising perspectives for overcoming the stalemate on this issue at the United Nations. It offers the fundamental elements necessary for a realistic  applicable  definitive and final political solution to a regional dispute that has hindered the development of a strong and homogeneous Maghreb that interacts with its geopolitical and geostrategic environment.  The Moroccan autonomy plan  which since 2004 has answered the calls by the Security Council for the need to find a political solution to that dispute  is in conformity with the provisions of international law. It is the result of wide-ranging international consultations and in-depth deliberations involving inhabitants of the region through the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs.  In the light of that positive dynamic  the Security Council adopted resolution 1754 (2007)  which represented a departure from former approaches in the treatment of the issue  since it called for negotiations while taking into account recent developments  in particular the Moroccan plan and the efforts of the Kingdom which the Security Council has recognized as serious and credible.  The Kingdom of Morocco  which took part in those negotiations in good faith and with an open and constructive attitude  reiterates its commitment to advance the process in order to reach a final solution to the dispute within the framework of its national sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as on the basis of the autonomy plan  as the ultimate objective of the negotiation process and as an open  flexible and indivisible offer. The solution to this regional dispute in the light of the Moroccan plan would lead to the creation of a stable regional security order  based on cooperation between the States of the region  which would deal with the serious security challenges of the region  including terrorism  human trafficking and other clandestine activities. The impact of such activities will go beyond the region and will affect European  Mediterranean and West African countries as well.  The difficult circumstances in the Middle East require strengthened coordinated efforts in order to put an end to a lengthy and bitter conflict that has caused great suffering for the people of the region for more than half a century.  The Kingdom of Morocco  which follows closely all those developments  affirms once again from this rostrum the pressing need to reactivate the peace process in the Middle East according to a comprehensive approach and on the basis of agreements signed by the parties  the Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative. That is a strategic choice and reflects the sincere will of the Arab States to search for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East   a peace that guarantees the national rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to establish an independent State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital  and withdrawal from occupied Arab territories in Syria and Lebanon  in order to allow the States and peoples of the region to live in peace and security.  Morocco is optimistic about the positive results that will ensure from the international conference on Middle East peace to be held in the United States before the end of this year. Moreover  the Kingdom of Morocco  which chairs the Al-Quds Committee in the person of His Majesty King Mohammed VI  insists once more on the need to respect the special status of Jerusalem and to preserve its cultural and spiritual identity. In that respect  His Majesty King Mohammed VI has endeavoured to draw the attention of the United Nations and influential actors to the illegal  invalid archaeological excavations around the Al-Aqsa Mosque and to obtain their good offices so as to put an end to them.  The Kingdom of Morocco follows with great concern the difficult situation in the brotherly country of Iraq and calls upon the various sects and factions to allow the virtues of wisdom and clear-sightedness to prevail  through serious dialogue and national reconciliation with the aim of preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and in order to put an end to the cycle of violence threatening its stability  security and its unity.  Finally  I wish to recall that the world is undergoing considerable changes and is confronted with numerous serious and global challenges  such as climate change  which is the main topic of this annual session. All these challenges call for multilateral institutions that are able to establish effective multilateral cooperation and coordination among States to promote coherence and synergy among the various national and regional initiatives. Hence the crucial importance of a stronger United Nations that enjoys the confidence and commitment of its Member States and their support in order to make a success of its reform programme. The Organization also needs to strengthen its credibility in order to harmonize its agenda with our crucial priorities and with the need to ensure a better future for humanity within the framework of more balanced  interdependent and tolerant international relations. "
"107",4388,"MCO",62,2007,"Allow me  at the outset  to address my warmest congratulations to the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. With that election  which honours your country  the Group of Eastern European States and the members of this Assembly have unanimously recognized  Sir  your eminent competence and your perfect knowledge of the Organization. You and the other members of the Bureau may be assured of the active cooperation of my delegation.  You have chosen the theme of climate change for this sixty-second session. I would like to thank you for that initiative  which has been commended by all.  Today  I would like to share my observations on this issue as well as my personal commitment in service of this cause. Very early on  I learned to appreciate nature and to take the necessary measures to protect it. From my very earliest years  I was taught to share and to give back. Then I wanted to see and learn things for myself  and my responsibility today is to testify and to act.  That is why  in June 2006  I decided to make my own contribution  as well as that of the Principality  by creating a Foundation. The mission of the Prince Albert II Foundation is to identify priority and symbolic projects and to accelerate their implementation in order to reach concrete results throughout the world aimed at a sustainable and equitable management of natural resources.  The Foundation’s activities are based on three strategic principles. The first is to act alongside nations  international institutions and opinion leaders in order to enhance consciousness of and accelerate decisions for sustainable development. I am personally committed to leading consciousness-raising missions on the ground around the world. I will also stand with other heads of States  as I do today  and take part in international negotiation meetings regarding the environment.  The second objective of my Foundation is to promote initiatives  activities and corporate actions that combine innovation with environmental protection. The Foundation in supporting and financing about 30 projects as of this year. Through its activities  the Foundation also wishes to attest to the fact that it is possible to engage in sustainable practices and behaviour that are respectful of the environment and compatible with economic  social and human development.  Lastly  its third objective is to create the broadest possible public understanding of the environmental challenges and responsibilities involved in those issues via outreach activities. I commit myself to devoting the time and energy necessary to the success of those actions.  All the programmes adopted by the Foundation comply with the environmental policy of my country. Monaco has long been active in protecting the marine environment and in developing scientific research in marine biology. The creation a century ago of the Oceanographic Museum and the Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology by my great-great-grandfather Albert I  and the more recent creation of an underwater reserve by my father  Prince Rainier III  bear witness to that policy. The RAMOGE Agreements for the control of marine pollution and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea  the Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic Area reinforced that international engagement. That vocation is part of the history of my country.  This year  I agreed to sponsor an ambitious international initiative launched by the United Nations Environment Programme  the objective of which is to provide for the planting of at least 1 billion trees throughout the world in 2007. Seven months after the launch of the operation  that objective was achieved. It is an extraordinary sign of hope  and I must commend the dynamism of the Programme  whose actions within the United Nations are essential for the environment.  The time for action is today. We already know that the future of humanity is at stake. This is a collective responsibility. To tackle this urgent matter  it is necessary to raise awareness  mobilize capacities and revolutionize our lifestyle. That is how we will forge a new relationship to nature. As Yves Coppens  a French scientist  stresses: “for millennia  climate has dictated man’s behaviour; today  it is man who dictates his behaviour on nature”.  It is also necessary to commit ourselves to promoting a new ethic   that of the right to the protection of the environment. What better place is there than this prestigious institution to lead the way forward? That new ethical dimension can be achieved only if built on the sincere commitment of each individual. That is why Bill Clinton  in his recent book  calls for concrete mobilization. As he says so well  “each one of us can give something. There is so much to do; it is never too late to start”. Like President Clinton  I believe that generosity is at the heart of that mobilization.  It is thus imperative to transcend our own selfishness and inertia  and to learn to develop a harmonious relationship between humankind and nature. Safeguarding our planet is the challenge of the twenty-first century. That challenge requires courage  tenacity  commitment and generosity. Above all  let us act. Peter Frumhoff  one of the main contributors to the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  declared  following a large-scale study undertaken by the Union of Concerned Scientists  that “some changes are inevitable  but the worst consequences can be avoided if we act quickly”. That message was reiterated over and over again yesterday during the high-level event on climate change convened by the Secretary-General.  The European Union has shown the way by committing to a 50 per cent reduction of its greenhouse gases by 2050. Let us help developing countries by finding new financial resources; let us quickly update our modes of production and consumption. To meet that challenge  we must work together to find solutions to existing problems. Individual announcements or actions will never solve the problem. The threat is global. As the climatologist Edouard Bard has pointed out  “global warming concerns our entire ecosystem and the consequences of this phenomenon can be done only at the global level”.  We have long lived in a world fraught with threats  but for the first time we are facing a planetary threat that threatens humankind itself. The evolution of human mindsets and behaviour will inevitably take time  but the planet cannot wait. Thus  without further delay  we must adopt a culture of responsibility. We must meet this historic challenge so that we may preserve planet Earth for our children. Let us make the choice of hope based on humanistic values  and let us not forget the power of courage when it is supported by the will to place humankind at the core of our priorities.  There are also ethical considerations which inspire my country’s constant and resolute commitment in the fight against terrorism. In no circumstances can violence ever be a legitimate means to pursue any combat  whatever the cause may be.  To consolidate its legal framework in compliance with international standards  and according to the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF)  the Principality of Monaco took measures identical to the European Union directives adopted to fight money laundering and terrorism. Without waiting for the new report of the Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures  in this area  my Government enacted new laws and regulations on these issues. With those tireless efforts  Monaco has been publicly recognized for leading the way in this field. I will maintain the required vigilance so that our legislative framework and our security policy will continue to guarantee the reputation of the Principality as a safe State. In so doing  I reiterate my unfaltering determination to combat the manifestations of terrorism regardless of their forms.  For my country  sustainable development and the fight against poverty go hand in hand  in that we are called upon to identify a new manner of growth more respectful of the resources of our planet  which  while abundant  are not inexhaustible. That is the reason why I asked my Government to increase by 30 per cent for the year 2008  under the heading of international cooperation  the total of the Principality’s voluntary contributions to the funds and programmes of the United Nations. This significant increase of funding for official development assistance is proof my country’s determination to eventually reach the target of devoting 0.7 per cent of gross national income to official development assistance. A great deal remains to be done in the fields of education  access to health care  the fight against pandemics and HIV/AIDS  human crises following natural disasters or conflicts and  lastly  the fight against poverty.  I pay particular attention to the Principality’s actions through multilateral and bilateral assistance programmes  supplemented by the generous initiatives of the charitable organizations in Monaco  which are also part of my country’s tradition.  Children’s welfare has  for a long time  been a priority commitment for the Principality. My sister  Her Royal Highness the Princess of Hanover  is actively involved with this issue through the World Association of Children’s Friends (AMADE Mondiale). In December  the General Assembly will hold a debate to evaluate progress in the implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action entitled “A world fit for children” (resolution S-27/2)  adopted in 2002. Considerable progress has been achieved in five years  although there still are too many needs to be met.  Monaco has also joined the campaign entitled “Unite for children. Unite against AIDS ” sponsored by UNICEF  the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization. My sister  Princess Stephanie  Special Representative of UNAIDS  has committed herself wholeheartedly to harnessing the energies of the Principality and beyond to advance in the fight against this scourge.  Reform of the Security Council remains a current issue. I reaffirm my country’s support for a process of increasing the membership of this Council. In fact  the chances of maintaining international peace and security will be that much greater if the representation of the international community in the Security Council were the most equitable possible.  I also express the wish that the newly established Department of Field Support  working alongside the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  will facilitate the actions of United Nations personnel on the ground working valiantly to safeguard peace. I congratulate the Secretary-General on the efforts he has undertaken to these ends.  My country became a Member of the United Nations 14 years ago. Ever since  the Principality has increased its participation on the international scene. The Principality has taken pleasure in hosting many international meetings and high-level conferences in recent years.   Accordingly  I am delighted that in February 2008  the tenth special session of the Governing Council of United Nations Environment Programme and the Global Ministerial Environment Forum will be held in Monaco. On that occasion  I will proudly receive ministers of the environment of Member States to discuss topics similar to those we are tackling within the General Assembly framework and thus to continue the debate launched here. In so doing  my country will  I hope  contribute once again its part to the fundamental debates of our time and will reaffirm its will to be at the heart of the genuine struggle. "
"108",4413,"MDA",62,2007,"I would like  first of all  to join the speakers who have already addressed this Assembly in congratulating Mr. Kerim on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.   It also gives me great pleasure to welcome the appointment of Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General and to acknowledge the distinct manner in which he has started his activities  as well as his tireless efforts to breathe a new dynamism into the United Nations with the purpose of optimizing its functioning.  The present session is especially meaningful for the Republic of Moldova  marking the fifteenth anniversary of its having joined the United Nations family. As a State Member of the United Nations  the Republic of Moldova has demonstrated faithfulness to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter by totally supporting the objectives of the Organization and sharing its responsibilities.  The globalization process is occurring everywhere and is of concern to all of us. As members know  those issues are addressed in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). In our opinion  the present level of aid is not sufficient; the identification of innovative sources of financing and an increase in the effectiveness of existing aid are imperative. In that vein  we hope that the recommendations in the areas of development contained in the report of the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence (A/61/583) will help us overcome the fragmentation of the United Nations so that the system can deliver as one  in partnership with all Member States.  The high-level event organized under the auspices of the Secretary-General that preceded the general debates drew attention to climate change  whose fatal effects have been experienced all over the world. We know about that very well as  this summer  our country suffered the worst drought in 60 years. We highly appreciate the United Nations institutions  first and foremost the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Food Programme  and all Member States which immediately answered our request for help. We continue to count on such aid in mitigating the consequences of the drought.  Under these circumstances  we favour the adoption of a new international agreement in this area  and we hope that the next session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will be able to negotiate new arrangements for moving beyond the Kyoto Protocol.  Terrorism remains a major threat to the internal security of countries and to international security. In that regard  the Republic of Moldova wholeheartedly supports United Nations efforts in fighting terrorism. One example of this is our joining the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Internally  the Government has undertaken a series of concrete actions towards fighting terrorism by adopting its national strategy for preventing and fighting money-laundering and terrorism financing  as well as by implementing relevant resolutions of the Security Council.  We see in the present session of the General Assembly an opportunity to finalize the draft of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism aimed at reaching an international consensus on a normative framework in that area. Heightened attention must be given to the fight against terrorism nourished by separatist tendencies that affect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. I wish to assure members that our delegation will participate actively in coordinating the negotiating process in the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly.   The United Nations has represented for decades the proper forum for tackling varied problems related to disarmament and non-proliferation. The Republic of Moldova welcomes the new approach to controlling small arms and light weapons and in that context we are in favour of a new agreement in the area of arms sales. We support the international community’s efforts aimed at establishing an efficient security system and arms control system and remain a faithful supporter of implementing the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE).   I wish to reiterate on this occasion the position of the Republic of Moldova that the withdrawal of the Russian troops that remain on Moldovan territory against our will  in conformity with the obligations assumed by the Russian Federation in 1999 in Istanbul  would create the necessary conditions for ratifying and applying the adapted CFE Treaty.  The Transdniestrian conflict remains a continuous obstacle to promoting reforms and ensuring the social and economic development of our country. A year ago  speaking in the Assembly  we addressed in great detail the problems related to the conflict and expressed hope for a final sustainable solution. Today  I have to state regretfully that the negotiations process   suspended since April 2006 because of the rigid and non-constructive position of separatist leaders supported from outside Moldova   could not be restarted  in spite of our constant efforts. That serves as a screen for promoting some political and mafia interests foreign to the people of the region. Continuous violations of fundamental human rights in the Transdniestrian region and the inefficiency of the existing peacekeeping mechanism make imperative the need to transform that mechanism into a multinational civil mission with an international mandate.  In the context of United Nations consolidation  the Republic of Moldova supports the adoption of decisions necessary for the revitalization of the General Assembly  reform of the Security Council and the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council. In that respect  we consider that the Security Council needs to be extended in both permanent and non-permanent categories  as a result of which the Eastern European Group would be offered an additional  non-permanent seat.  We welcome the adoption of resolution 61/16  on the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council  the major body for coordinating the economic and social activities of the United Nations. The Republic of Moldova presented its candidature for the current year’s elections to the Economic and Social Council  and I take this opportunity to thank all the Member States that granted us their trust.  The Republic of Moldova has constantly supported the maintenance and consolidation of the Organization’s role in resolving crisis and conflict situations  aiding in post-conflict construction and providing humanitarian assistance to affected zones in various parts of the world  especially to the zones affected by conflicts  including the GUAM region. In that respect  we welcome the decision of the General Assembly to maintain in the agenda of the current session item 16  entitled Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace  security and development  and the increased attention it is paying to the issue.  I would like in conclusion to reaffirm the will of the State I represent to cooperate in and actively contribute to the common efforts of Member States to strengthen the United Nations as the Organization that holds the key role in peacekeeping  security and sustainable development. "
"109",4457,"MDG",62,2007,"Each and every one of us knows that there is an urgent need for the globalization of responsibility. Each of us knows that this responsibility demands more than just goodwill. Each of us knows that the globalization of responsibility demands the creation of the right environment to reach these objectives. Every year  these objectives and measures are repeated at this General Assembly. Every year  the actions to fulfil them remain weak.  This is the fifth time I have taken part in the General Assembly  and I must honestly tell you that I am very concerned about two things. First  I am very concerned because national interests prevail over emergencies that affect us all. These emergencies are closely linked to common interests. It is in the interest of all of us to address them together. Second  I am very concerned about the lack of seriousness. A lot of promises are made  but not a lot of promises are kept.  Today  we are confronted with two major challenges that could entail major disasters should we not take them seriously and act quickly. Those challenges must be the priority of priorities. The first concerns climate change. The second is the development of Africa.  Imagine the impact on all the nations and all the people represented here if the situation worsens. All of our national efforts will be ruined by earthquakes  ecological disasters and social disasters. Climate change creates and aggravates conflicts. The refugees and victims of climate change will be the refugees and victims of wars and poverty. We must act today to save the earth  or this earth will not be ours anymore.  On the other hand  imagine the impact on all nations and all people if the current situation improves. It will strengthen the confidence of nations and investors. If the world were in ecological balance  and if it were without poverty  there would be a considerable impact on political and social conflicts.  The two challenges are bound together. Africa will have either a positive or a negative impact on the world climate  with enormous repercussions. Our actions and our decisions will decide. The world climate will have either a positive or a negative impact  with enormous repercussions for the development of Africa. Again  our decisions and our actions will decide.  Africa only produces one per cent of the world's solar energy. In Africa  the possibilities for new and clean forms of energy and for the reduction of carbon dioxide are enormous.  Madagascar could provide some of its energy needs through the development of hydropower. Additionally  half of the island could be reforested. Our island  called the Red Island  could once again become known as the Green Island.  There is a strong link between the quality of the environment and poverty. Many bushfires are the result of poverty; the destruction of natural resources increases poverty. It is necessary to quickly step out of this vicious cycle. Increased international help will limit the exploitation of natural resources by poor farmers.  In Madagascar  we have been planning our development strategies around the concept of sustainability for some time now. Our vision is called “Madagascar  Naturally!” It means that our natural resources and our people are our wealth. We will preserve our environment and increase its value by using it responsibly.  We are actively looking for international investment  but believe that in the long run this will not amount to much unless we have domestic investors as well. We can create added value through our successes in processing our natural products.  We are convinced that economic growth from the bottom up is the key to success. The most important message I gave to the Malagasy people at the beginning of my second term was the necessity of decentralization right down to the level of the fokontany. Originally  the fokontany was the traditional Malagasy village. We are trying our best to restore the balance between humans and nature.  This is a different approach; this is a Malagasy approach; this is an approach that encourages the Malagasy people to take their future into their own hands; this is not the approach of the donors. With this approach we strive to forge a partnership with the international community.   We have described all of this in detail in the Madagascar Action Plan. Read it  and you will see that we are already contributing to meeting the challenges that I have mentioned. We are committing ourselves to protecting and cherishing the environment  to healing the injuries of the past and to ending rampant climate change.   In the Action Plan we came up with a set of very ambitious goals. We do what we can  despite our limited resources; we could do so much more if the international community helped us more.  We are thankful to the donors who have increased their financial assistance; however  as a whole  these efforts have fallen far short of our expectations  especially if we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The amount of financial assistance is not even close to the promise of doubled aid to Africa. The donors are still far from honouring the numerous promises made here at the United Nations. They are far from addressing global challenges. The international approach to Africa lacks seriousness.  Aid to Africa is still not a success story for many members of the international community. On average  results are poor  but Africa is advancing as a continent — not everywhere  but in an increasing number of countries.  Once  Madagascar rated amongst the least effective countries. Today  we are an effective country. Our economy has benefited from continuous economic growth: we had 5 per cent economic growth 5 years ago  6 per cent over the last few years and 7 per cent in 2007. Poverty rates are dropping dramatically; in 2002  80 per cent of our population lived in poverty and last year this rate stood at 67 per cent.  Aid to Africa is as weak as ever. Africa can absorb so much more and all countries would benefit from this. The European Union is a good example of a lot of aid leading to great benefits for many countries. I am convinced that Africa could advance much quicker if the international community and the African countries could come up with a new plan.   A “Marshall Plan” for Africa — I have suggested this repeatedly over the years and I am saying it again: We need a “Marshall Plan” for Africa. A crucial element to this plan should be a new partnership. I propose to you an ecological partnership between the industrialized countries and Africa. Such a partnership could contribute substantially to finding real solutions to some of the climate problems through a programme of investment. Other important features would include nature conservation and the preservation of our biodiversity.  I am convinced that Africa could supply clean energy  medicinal and industrial plants and other natural products in the future. The world will eventually need more and more of these.  We feel that sustainable policies that emphasize protection and added value should be high on our agenda  and should represent our commitment to the world. Remember though that such policies will also benefit our country.  In Madagascar  cyclones destroy a large part of our harvests every year; they destroy houses; they kill people. The increase in the number and strength of those cyclones is hindering the whole process of development. Higher temperatures are reducing harvests and our unique biodiversity. They also lead to more and more harmful inserts and illnesses.   All over Africa  we are already seeing the consequences of climate change. Droughts and floods are the causes of increased migration and serious conflicts. An aggravation of climate change will not only bring fluxes of devastating waters on all continents  but also fluxes of refugees and waves of social conflicts.  In short  the world needs Africa to solve the problem of climate change  and Africa needs a stable climate for lasting  sustainable development. To achieve this globalization of responsibility will require dedicated leadership. We need leaders who can mobilize their people and get results — fast results and big results.  At this time I want to congratulate the new Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I wish him the best of success in this very important task. We in Africa look to the United Nations for dynamic leadership — it is our hope. May his leadership help us to get results — the kind of results that bring peace and prosperity to Africa and to the world. "
"110",4496,"MDV",62,2007,"Allow me at the outset to extend to Mr. Kerim my delegation’s warmest congratulations on his election to preside over the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. His election to that high office is a tribute to his wisdom and skill  as well as a true reflection of the important role played by his country in the international arena. I assure him of my delegation’s full cooperation in his work.  At the same time  allow me to place on record my delegation’s profound gratitude and appreciation to his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for the commendable manner in which she guided the work of the sixty-first session.  Let me also take this opportunity to express my delegation’s deep appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his dedication and leadership. The Maldives pledges its full support for the Secretary-General’s untiring work in promoting the noble principles of this Organization.  It is indeed a privilege for me to address the General Assembly on this historic day  when the United Nations is observing the International Day of Non-Violence. On this day  we pay special tribute to Mahatma Gandhi  one of the greatest men of all times.   The Maldives has always been a country which has promoted peace  non-violence  tolerance and human rights. However  the spectre of terrorism visited the Maldives this past weekend. On Saturday afternoon  an improvised explosive device was detonated in the commercial area of our capital  Malé  injuring 12 innocent bystanders. That unprovoked attack was the first of its kind in our history. I would like to extend our sincere sympathies to those who were injured and to their families.   The Maldives is a country renowned for its tranquillity and warm welcomes. Our people are united in shock and outrage that this happened on our soil. That shock is matched by a determination that such cowardly acts of aggression will not be allowed to undermine or jeopardize the maintenance of our peaceful and harmonious society. On behalf of the people of the Maldives  I would like to take this opportunity to thank our many friends in the international community for their expressions of support and solidarity. I would particularly like to thank those countries that have provided us with their expertise  technical advice and assistance in the ongoing investigations. Finally  I would like to commend the work of our domestic law enforcement and other agencies that have reacted to the incident with such speed and professionalism. The incident serves as a reminder that no State is immune from the scourge of terrorism. The Maldives utterly condemns all acts of terrorism  wherever they are perpetrated.  The Maldives  as a low-lying small island State  is particularly vulnerable to the perils of global climate change  a point brought sharply into focus by the recent sea swells that submerged a large part of the country. For the past 20 years  the Maldives  along with its partners in the Alliance of Small Island States  has thus been at the forefront of efforts to bring the issue of climate change and its devastating impact on small island developing States to the world’s attention.  Addressing this Assembly in 1987 at the high-level debate on environment and development  the President of the Republic of Maldives  Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom  said:  “The profound dilemma of environmental transition is a global one  and its implications are worldwide and long-term. Though the Maldives and other low-lying archipelagic nations may have to suffer the most immediate and the most extreme effects of a global sea-level rise  there is a potential danger to a significant portion of the world’s population in the near future … No one nation  or even a group of nations  can alone combat the onset of a global change in environment.”  Since that ground-breaking debate  the international community has convened numerous conferences and summits at which it has agreed on a wide range of plans and programmes of action aimed at addressing global climate change. However  as a community of nations we must regretfully concede that  all too often  the reality of implementation has failed to match the ambitions of rhetoric.  Twenty years on  greenhouse gas emission levels are continuing to increase unabated and the consequences of global warming are becoming ever more  apparent. One can only therefore conclude that the past 20 years have been an era of missed opportunities.  Despite those stark facts  last week’s high-level debate on climate change has once again given us some hope and encouragement. As a result of a palpable change in world opinion  there is now a real sense of international momentum leading towards December’s crucial Conference in Bali. We believe that the Conference offers us a chance to overcome the failed promises and missed opportunities of the past  and to build a new global consensus on climate change.  We must take collective responsibility and agree to an integrated and comprehensive approach to climate change that recognizes and covers all four pillars of climate change policy   mitigation  adaptation  technology transfer and funding. While the necessary steps are clear  the crucial question  as always  is whether the international community has the political will to undertake those steps; to build on the commitments entered into in Rio  Kyoto  Johannesburg  New York and elsewhere; and to secure a successful outcome from the Bali process.  I can assure the Assembly that the Maldives will play its part in this process. I am happy to announce here today my Government’s intention to host a preparatory meeting for the Alliance of Small Island States in the Maldives in November. The purpose of this meeting is to draft a collective stand on the individual human dimension of climate change for submission to the Bali Conference.   The Asian tsunami of 2004 represented the worst natural disaster in the history of the Maldives. The economic damage and losses alone were equivalent to almost two thirds of the country’s gross domestic product. Although much remains to be done to complete the process of recovery  a considerable amount has already been achieved. We need the continued support of our development partners and the international community to overcome the challenge of tsunami recovery.  The devastating tsunami threatened to derail the Maldives in its attempts to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and our planned graduation from the list of least developed countries (LDCs).  Despite the tsunami  the Maldives continues to make strong progress towards the attainment of the MDGs. The Maldives has already achieved Goal 1  the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger  and Goal 2  the achievement of universal primary education. We are also on course to meet Goals 4  5 and 6 on reducing child mortality  improving maternal health  and combating communicable diseases  respectively. Consolidating and strengthening progress towards all the MDGs is a key focus of the recently launched seventh national development plan.  Buoyed by these successes  the Maldives will next year begin its transition period for graduation from LDC status. For the Maldives  graduation represents a double-edged sword. On the one hand  it is recognition of the startling economic and social development that the country has enjoyed over the past 30 years. On the other hand  graduation will bring with it a range of new challenges. For example  we will enjoy less favourable trading conditions and reduced levels of development assistance. Adapting to this new reality will not be easy. In that regard  I would like to use my speech today to once again urge our international partners to assist us in making the transition as smooth as possible.  Next year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Maldives Government is determined to mark the occasion by completing the country’s current reform agenda  an ambitious programme of reforms designed to strengthen individual rights and freedoms  ahead of multiparty elections under a new Constitution.  Since the start of the reform agenda in 2004  the Maldives has made remarkable strides in the field of human rights. An independent Paris Principles-compliant Human Rights Commission has been established. The Maldives has acceded to the two major human rights covenants   on civil and political rights  and on economic  social and cultural rights. Later today I will sign  on behalf of the Government  the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  meaning that the Maldives will have signed or ratified eight of the nine core human rights treaties. Last year  the Maldives also became the first country in Asia to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  However  the Government readily concedes that much more needs to be done. Therefore  the Government is proceeding in its work in close cooperation with international human rights bodies. For example  last year  the Maldives became one of the few countries to extend a standing invitation to visit the country to all United Nations human rights special rapporteurs. In addition  earlier this year  the Government invited the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to appoint a national human rights adviser to the Maldives.  The Maldives reiterates its support for the right of the Palestinian people to an independent homeland. We therefore call on the international community  led by the Quartet  to revive the peace process as a matter of urgency.   The Maldives also calls on the international community to continue and intensify its efforts to bring peace and stability to Iraq and Afghanistan.  The Maldives also reiterates its steadfast opposition to the development  proliferation or use of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.  Strengthening and revitalizing the United Nations to take on the new and emerging challenges of the twenty-first century remains an important task. We are encouraged by the progress that has been made in implementing the wide-ranging United Nations reform programme over the past two years. We sincerely believe  however  that these reforms cannot fully succeed without the much-needed and concurrent reform of the Security Council. Maldives firmly believes that an effective multilateral framework is fundamental for the security of small States and that such a framework should take into consideration modern geopolitical realities.  In this regard  the Maldives reiterates its support for the Group of Four (G-4) draft resolution on Security Council reform. We hope  therefore  that we will be able to make progress on Security Council reform during this session.  Before I conclude  please allow me to reaffirm our commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to offer our full support to its continuing work for the betterment of humanity and for the maintenance of international peace and security. "
"111",4543,"MEX",62,2007,"Permit  me to express to you  Sir  my delegation’s warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are convinced that you will be able to skilfully guide our efforts to attain the common objectives that we have set for the session. I should also like to express Mexico’s gratitude for the excellent work of your predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa.  Likewise  I wish to express my gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the work accomplished on major items on our agenda during the first months of his mandate. I also wish to congratulate him on the high-level event on climate change  held last week  which undoubtedly helped to raise awareness about an issue that deserves priority attention.  At a time when the international community is facing many challenges that test our capacity to fulfil the purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  it is essential to strengthen and make effective use of multilateral institutions. In that connection  the Organization must daily reaffirm itself as the indisputable centre for coexistence among States and the guarantor of compliance with international law. Mexico  as a founding Member of this pre-eminent universal forum  takes this opportunity to reaffirm its firm and decisive commitment to multilateralism.  We are living in a complex world situation characterized by armed conflicts of various sorts  including inter-ethnic conflicts that are not confined by borders; the commission of terrorist acts; the destabilizing activities of transnational organized crime; the proliferation of the arms race in all its aspects; and environmental degradation  situations of abject poverty  social exclusion and discrimination and pandemics affecting broad sectors of the world population. That is why  more than ever before  we need an Organization capable of meeting the needs of women and men throughout the world. In that context  we must think about the role of the United Nations.   Mexico sees three fundamental approaches for harmonizing relations among States and addressing the great challenges of our time: shared responsibility in the face of globalization  the promotion of human security for development and the responsibility to cooperate in the multilateral arena.   Every State is responsible  to its own society and to the international community  for guaranteeing the rule of law and the full enjoyment of human rights  promoting development  protecting the environment and countering new threats to security in order to provide the best possible living conditions for its people. The actions of the Government of Mexico at the internal level are based on those pillars so as to guarantee the rule of law throughout the national territory  given the onslaught of organized crime  and to reaffirm the authority of the State in the full exercise of its responsibilities.   The security of the population is not limited to the physical protection of individuals. That is why human security must be understood as a broad and integral concept that can meet the needs of society as a whole. It is a concept that includes elements ranging from strict respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms to adequate preparation of the population to deal with natural disasters or pandemics.   Mindful of the value of the individual  the Government of Mexico bases its activities on the quest for sustainable human development  which means seeking to promote the comprehensive development of individuals in all aspects   social  economic  political  cultural  human and environmental   and to do it in such a way as to ensure that future generations have opportunities to achieve well-being.   Within the framework of multilateral institutions  States have freely shouldered the obligation to cooperate with others in addressing all problems in areas such as  inter alia  combating drug trafficking and terrorism and preserving the environment  in which internal efforts alone are insufficient and concerted action is required.  Shared responsibility in the face of globalization  promoting human security for development and the responsibility to cooperate in the multilateral arena are among the main concerns of our Organization. A good example of this is climate change. As the Secretary-General himself has indicated  climate change is among the most serious  complex and multifaceted threats confronting the world. Mexico favours the multilateral climate change regime developed within the United Nations as an ideal framework for shaping commitments to be adopted in the near future. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol are the appropriate areas for negotiation.  Emerging and developing countries must consider the fact that the costs of inaction of passivity in the face of climate change will be to the detriment of their own development efforts. We in Mexico have understood this. The national development plan 2007-2012 includes actions related to environmental sustainability  with two specific objectives: reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and promoting measures to adapt to the effects of climate change. The inaction of others must not be a pretext for failing to do our part. We are convinced that shared but differentiated responsibilities must motivate all countries to take action to the best of their abilities and that developed countries  without exception  must contribute substantially to the collective effort in the technological and financial sphere.  Mexico believes that we must break away from the limitations of the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol  whereby the achievement of developed countries’ goals depends on their geographical location. What we need are positive incentives to supplement  not replace  the national efforts of developing countries. It is urgent that such incentives reward the efforts of beneficiary countries that make such efforts in their own interests. Accordingly  those that do more should receive greater support.   In recent years  the international community has had to face a series of challenges in the fight against terrorism. One of those challenges has been to guarantee the maintenance of international peace and security in the face of terrorism’s evil effects without renouncing the universal and absolute values of human rights. That is an essential condition for civilized coexistence within and beyond our borders.   The United Nations has determined  in a number of commitments  that measures adopted by States to combat terrorism and to protect their citizens and provide adequate security for them must respect obligations undertaken in accordance with international law  in particular human rights norms  the rights of refugees and international humanitarian law.   Promoting and protecting human rights is one of the highest priorities for the Government of Mexico. We  the international community  have the responsibility to ensure universal and indivisible respect for human rights for all  regardless of the circumstances. Today  the situation in Myanmar demands our attention.   The creation of the Human Rights Council and the adoption of the institutional reform package  which includes the establishment of a universal periodic review mechanism  have marked a watershed in building a more just and equitable international system for human rights. Double standards in this area can no longer exist. With objectivity and in a spirit of cooperation  we must promote the evaluation of human rights in all Member States without any distinction. That effort strengthens the essential role of the Organization in developing international norms to protect human rights and represents the most solid foundation for achieving the well-being of our peoples.   In that regard  we welcome the recent adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Mexico remains open to scrutiny by treaty bodies and to special procedures on human rights  which have played an essential role in identifying the challenges our country still faces.   Given the multidimensional nature of international migration  Mexico believes that our Organization is the most fitting forum for dealing with these problems  on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility and of strengthening cooperation among States directly affected by that phenomenon. The issue of migration can in no way be limited solely to its State security aspects. We must have a comprehensive understanding based on respect for the human rights of all migrants  regardless of their legal status  taking into account the economic  social and cultural implications of the phenomenon.   We say this from our own experience. Mexico is a country of origin  transit and destination for migrants. For that reason  in addition to recognizing our own responsibility domestically  we must adopt effective measures to strengthen the international framework for the protection of migrants. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families is  without a doubt  a valuable reference point. While we recognize the need to cooperate in that area  Mexico is shouldering its own responsibility to create conditions so that our compatriots are able to find more and better opportunities within our country. That is why the Government of President Felipe Calderón is taking action on a number of fronts to promote public and private investment in order to develop programmes to create more jobs; to increase access to secondary and post-secondary education; to guarantee access to medical services  including in the most isolated and marginalized areas of the country; to ensure social security coverage; and to reduce inequality among our citizens.  It is clear that the success of our development policies requires a favourable international economic environment and cooperation among States. The United Nations is playing an essential role in providing technical assistance and monitoring the implementation of commitments undertaken by the international community at the major conferences  summits and forums sponsored by the Organization.   Seven years from the date set for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  we note with concern that while significant progress has been achieved in some areas of the world  in other areas there are still delays and even steps backward. We recognize that each country is responsible for its own development. However  national efforts must be accompanied by international action based on the global alliance forged at the International Conference on Financing for Development  held in Monterrey  Mexico. That will ensure complementarity between national strategies and the development of the world economy. Mexico hopes that the Economic and Social Council’s new Development Cooperation Forum and the international review conference on the Monterrey Consensus to be held in Doha in 2008 will be steps in that direction.   International security requires renewed commitments. Although there has been a numerical reduction in nuclear arsenals since the end of the cold war  it is disturbing to see the growing sophistication of related technology. Unfortunately  that points to a new phase in the arms race. Mexico is convinced that the only guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons is a progressive reduction aimed at their complete elimination and the certainty that they will never be produced again. As one of the initial steps for achieving nuclear disarmament  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty must enter into force as soon as possible. Mexico also believes that the vital strengthening of the non-proliferation regime requires the fulfilment of obligations undertaken by all States  nuclear and non-nuclear  under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  with a view to its universalization. If no progress is achieved on non-proliferation or disarmament  fear  mistrust and greater insecurity will prevail. In this regard  the NPT review conference to be held in 2010 is a new opportunity for safeguarding and strengthening these objectives.   We welcome the agreements recently reached with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We are convinced that the ongoing controversy over nuclear matters in the case of the Islamic Republic of Iran must be resolved through diplomacy and strict compliance with commitments undertaken within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency.   Mexico supports the resolution of conflicts in various regions through dialogue  negotiations and full respect for international law. That is particularly true in dealing with the most critical items on the United Nations agenda.   We are following with particular attention recent developments on various aspects of the situation in the Middle East and their impact on international stability. We support efforts aimed at a new peace process between Israel and Palestine  convinced that a final solution can be achieved only through negotiation between the parties with the active support of the international community. We hope that in the very near future the State of Israel and a politically and economically viable Palestinian State can coexist within secure and internationally recognized borders  in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.   If multilateralism has returned  it is now up to States to show the political will necessary to promote concrete reform  ranging from adjusting the Security Council to meet the needs of our time to ensuring greater coherence in action to promote sustainable development. The response to the institutional crisis of recent years does not lie in alternative mechanisms or unilateral or partial approaches  but rather  we must give the Organization the necessary tools to carry out its responsibilities effectively.   Mexico believes that expanding the Security Council is an unavoidable necessity in order to make that body more representative. In this regard  my Government favours increasing the number of non-permanent members  with the possibility of being re-elected in order to promote accountability. We believe that any other formula will highlight existing inequalities.  Mexico is the tenth largest contributor to this Organization and a country loyal to the cause of the United Nations. We are committed to its reform and ready to shoulder greater responsibilities on the international scene. In line with this vision  Mexico has submitted its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2009-2010 period.  The Government of Mexico has expressed its political will to constructively participate in the work of the Council in the areas of maintaining international peace and security and dealing with questions on the world agenda that are within the purview of the Council.   On this basis  Mexico reaffirms its determination to actively contribute to building a more secure  democratic and equitable international society. "
"112",4568,"MHL",62,2007,"I bring warm greetings of “iakwe” from the people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands  on whose behalf I have the honour to address the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.  I wish to convey our congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election in the presidency of the Assembly at this session. I am confident that  under your able leadership  consensus on crucial issues will be achieved  benefiting the entire membership  particularly the often-forgotten remote small island States of the Pacific. My commendation also goes to your predecessor for her successful stewardship of the work of the Assembly at its sixty-first session.  Allow me to also congratulate you  Mr. Secretary-General  for your election as the eighth Secretary-General of this Organization. Steering the United Nations in today’s interwoven world of complex trials and tribulations remains ever more challenging  and I wish to express my country’s confidence in your stewardship and to commend you for your current efforts in taking a range of measures to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations.  For the past 62 years  we have come to this Assembly to express various issues and concerns dear to our heart  as they affect the daily lives of our citizens. Education  health and the environment are among the issues at the top of my country’s priorities  but these issues are nothing if we  the community of nations  fail to attempt to avert the forthcoming ecological disaster.   My people are concerned with   or rather terrified by   with the issue of our very survival. Will we even exist 50 years from today? If we are to exist at all  we must put a stop to the rising tide of destruction unleashed by global warming. Our future   or perhaps  our absence of future   depends on the decisive actions of this Assembly. I find no pride in having coined the term “ecological refugee”. It is my deepest hope that no one  and certainly no one in the Marshall Islands  will have to bear that name.  Since my election more than seven years ago  educating the world about the threat my people face as a result of sea-level rise and global warming has been one of my Government’s priorities. In addressing the issue of climate change  actions and real progress are needed. In saying this  I am proud to announce the new alliance that my Government established earlier this year with the local government of Martin Luther King Jr. County  in Washington State in the United States  aimed at confronting the threat posed by global warming.  The unwavering faith I have in this Organization is the reason why I am standing at this podium today on behalf of my people. On our shoulders  as leaders  lies the responsibility entrusted to us  to keep not only the peace to live in harmony and with dignity  but to preserve our environment to ensure the very survival of our children for generations to come.  I commend the Secretary-General for convening a high-level meeting on climate change this week. I am also hopeful that we  as leaders  will come up with the necessary agreements on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December. While we are committed to playing our part  strong leadership is required by the major industrialized countries. We once again renew our support for the Framework Convention and the Kyoto Protocol  and we call upon all States that have not yet done so   in particular the major emitters   to ratify the Protocol without further delay. We also call upon the international community to assist small island developing States in developing and implementing comprehensive adaptation strategies.  I remain hopeful that the international community can reach a consensus on moving forward the necessary agreements to achieve lasting peace  security and diplomatic solutions to the seemingly endless web of issues. We are so integrated and interconnected today that we all face equal challenges  be it in terrorism or the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I commend this Assembly for adopting last September the historic United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  which will prevent the global scourge of terrorism. The Marshall Islands remains committed in the fight against terrorism  and we continue to take action at the national level and to cooperate at the regional and international levels to ensure that we combat terrorist threats with comprehensive and united action.  In the area of disarmament and non-proliferation  our collective efforts need to be invigorated to overcome stalemate. Nuclear weapons and the testing conducted on our islands in the past is a nightmare that continues to haunt my people. The 67 atmospheric weapons detonated on my island of Bikini Atoll from 1946 to 1958 continue to inflict pain and suffering on my people to this day. The Marshallese people were under the care of the United Nations Trusteeship Council when the United States nuclear testing programme was in progress. Once again  I call on the United Nations and its agencies and Member States who share similar experiences and have the expertise to assist us with the restoration of our radiation-contaminated environment to provide the needed assistance for my people’s health-care needs that are linked to radiation exposure  and to support the Marshall Islands’ Changed Circumstances Petition  which was submitted to the United States Congress in 2000.  I commend the work of the Assembly at its sixty-first session in adopting resolution 61/109  which requests the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation to continue its work  including its activities to increase knowledge about the levels  effects and risks of ionizing radiation from all sources  and requests the United Nations Environment Programme to continue to provide support for the work of the Committee and for the dissemination of its findings and to review and strengthen the Committee’s present funding. I am confident that my people will benefit from the Committee’s work  noting that previous policy and resettlement decisions based on misleading scientific opinions have caused so much suffering among my people.  My people’s survival and well-being also depend on our ocean resources. We are encouraged by international and regional agreements and treaties that aim to protect these scarce resources. However  illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing continues to threaten our major source of livelihood. In protecting our ocean resources from exploitation  we continue to seek assistance from Member States with the expertise and capacity in conducting and enforcing conservation and management measures  as well as in the development of our domestic fisheries. I reiterate once again my support for a moratorium on bottom-trawling until there are clear indications on its negative effects on the ocean biodiversity.   The Micronesia Challenge   a commitment led by the Republic of Palau  the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands   aims at conserving that biodiversity and our vulnerable ecosystem by effectively conserving at least 30 per cent of the near-shore marine and 20 per cent of the forest resources across Micronesia by 2020. The Micronesia Challenge is part of a much larger and growing commitment by island nations throughout the world to take the international lead in preserving primary ecosystems. I call on the international community to support the efforts that have been put in place and to develop and provide the resources for realistic financial plans in support of conservation and sustainable use of our natural resources.  Within the Pacific region  we continue to cooperate closely to ensure that effective regional actions are taken in our endeavour to combat our vulnerabilities in the economic  social and environmental areas  which are priority areas highlighted under the Pacific Plan and Kalibobo Roadmap  endorsed by Pacific leaders almost two years ago.   My Government has had the pleasure of hosting and actively engaging in several regional meetings held to that effect. The Eighth Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders  which I was honoured to chair in Washington; the Seventh Annual Micronesian President’s Summit  held in Chuuk  Federated States of Micronesia  earlier this month; the seventh Food and Agriculture Organization meeting of the South West Pacific Ministers for Agriculture  held in May; and the Micronesians in Island Conservation conference  held last June in Majuro   all these provided the opportunity for our leaders  development partners and non-governmental partners to meet with other leaders from the region to address the wide range of issues and challenges that continue to plague the Pacific.  In my view  the successful implementation of regional commitments international obligations can be achieved only with the support and commitment of member countries  regional and international organizations  development partners and a range of stakeholders.  In that regard  I wish to emphasize that the assistance of the international community  which has played a crucial role in enabling us to meet current and emerging challenges  is still very much needed. There is only so much that we can do as small island developing States; thus  now more than ever  I continue to call on the international community for considerable investments and comprehensive assistance  including the much-needed policy reorientation to address the interlinked issues of economic  social and environmental security.  The Republic of the Marshall Islands was founded on the ideals of freedom  democracy and respect for human rights. We continue to observe and stand for those democratic values and the defence and promotion of human rights. The United Nation’s noble ideals of good governance  democracy  multilateralism and respect for human dignity also serve as my guiding light in my capacity of high steward of my people.  However  while the United Nations continues to work with States in resolving disputes peacefully and in helping to create democratic societies  it still turns a blind eye to the 23 million people of Taiwan and silences their voices. The absence of Taiwan in the United Nations creates a gap in the global network for cooperation  goes against the ideals and concept of justice upheld by the United Nations and contravenes the principle of universality.  We reiterate our support for the reform and expansion of the Security Council and for a criteria-based approach under which potential members  such as Japan  must be well qualified  based on factors such as economic size  population  commitment to democracy and human rights  financial contributions to the United Nations and contributions to United Nations peacekeeping efforts.  During the general debate of the sixtieth session  we noted in this historic Hall that the United Nations and its offices and agencies did not have a permanent presence in many of the small island developing States of the Pacific. In June 2006  it was announced that a coalition of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) would open a total of eight new offices in the Pacific island countries. We welcomed that historic accomplishment  the progress it marked towards harmonization within the United Nations and the assistance and support the new offices would provide in developing national capacity and meeting the Millennium Development Goals.  We  Member States that pay our dues  deploy peacekeepers  and discharge our responsibilities in the international community  deserve offices that give relevance to the United Nations and the implementation of its doctrines. The Marshall Islands is appreciative of the work currently under way for the establishment of a joint presence in our country by UNFPA  which will be the leading agency on behalf of UNDP and UNICEF. We  however  ask the General Assembly and the Secretariat to ensure that offices befitting the ideals and reputation of the United Nations are established in the other identified Pacific island countries.  In closing  I wish to reassure you  Mr. President  that the Marshall Islands remains committed to the implementation of the commitments made over the last decade  and we expect our partners to fulfil their commitments as well. The sustainable development of small island developing States  such as the Marshall Islands  can only be achieved through a genuine partnership within the international community. Only then can we realize the commonly shared goal of universal peace and prosperity.  My delegation looks forward to a productive session under your able leadership  Sir. Komol tata  and God bless.

"113",4592,"MKD",62,2007,"It is a privilege and an honour for me to address this forum and to share the views of the Republic of Macedonia regarding issues of utmost importance for the current session of the General Assembly. However  allow me first of all to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate my fellow countryman  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  on his election as President of General Assembly at its sixty-second session. His nomination to this prestigious position is yet another proof of the full dedication of the Republic of Macedonia to the promotion of the aims of this unique global Organization.  I would also like to congratulate the previous General Assembly President  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa  for her successful presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-first session. Allow me as well to take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  on the energetic start of his mandate and his dedication in this time of great importance for our Organization. The issue of climate change was rightly proposed by the President of the General Assembly as a topic to be discussed during this general debate. The alleviation of the impact of global warming and climate change  which has become one of the greatest challenges for individual countries  but also for the entire international community  calls for the undertaking of coordinated and serious measures. It is our obligation to preserve our planet for the generations to come. Therefore  one of our imperatives would be to provide clear political support in responding to the negative impact of global warming  while not impeding economic growth and the reduction of poverty. In this context  apart from recognizing the central role of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  we should also promote consultations within the United Nations environmental institutions.  People around the world expect the United Nations to improve its performance and continue to deliver. For many  this Organization remains a symbol of hope and of support in times of need  but also a helping hand in times of crisis. The world has changed  and so have the challenges. The United Nations must also continue to change in order to be ready to respond.  The 2005 World Summit Outcome created a solid basis for all necessary reforms. A lot has been achieved   perhaps not as much as was expected  but the progress made so far is visible. We must continue working on the reforms of the main bodies  in the interest of transparency and effectiveness.  The Republic of Macedonia strongly supports the current management reform directed towards achieving efficiency and accountability in the United Nations system. The new bodies are already a reality and fully operational. What we expect in particular is the Human Rights Council to strengthen its role in the global promotion and protection of human rights. Driven by our strong will to contribute to the work of this highly important body  we have put forward our application for membership for the period from 2009 to 2012.  The report of the United Nations High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence offered a number of valuable recommendations for the reform of United Nations operational activities. I hope that the discussions during the current session will help to create a consensus on measures to strengthen United Nations capacities in the areas of development  humanitarian assistance and environment.  The issue of disarmament  arms control and non-proliferation must remain high on our agenda. We must therefore attach further importance to these issues  which are relevant for the achievement of global peace  security and development.  Terrorism continues to threaten our world. The fight against terrorism is yet another area in which we must stand united. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its Plan of Action  adopted last year  provide an excellent framework for our individual and joint actions. We must promote their implementation at the national and regional level and seek to achieve visible results.  At the 2005 World Summit  we reaffirmed our commitment to global partnership for development as stated in the Millennium Declaration  the Monterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. We fully agree that every country bears the responsibility for its own development  which depends mainly on national policies and strategies. We also agree that global actions are necessary as a support to national efforts.   Some regions need more shared responsibility than others in order to achieve the projected targets. Africa  where the situation remains alarming  requires special attention. With this in mind  we endorse the call for renewed commitment to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  and we await the forthcoming High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development  which is expected to bring specific results.  United Nations involvement in Africa  including in the Sudan  remains of exceptional importance. The situation in Darfur is extremely critical and alarming. Member States must reunite once again and provide support to United Nations activities in order to respond to the challenges on the ground.  The Middle East situation continues to be an issue of utmost concern. People in the Middle East deserve to live free from fear and threats. The Republic of Macedonia supports the efforts of the Quartet and the Road Map. A renewed peace process is also of utmost urgency. The situation in Lebanon also remains high on the international agenda. Recently  the Republic of Macedonia joined the United Nations forces in that area by sending military officers to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  Since the very beginning  the Republic of Macedonia has been part of the international anti-terrorist coalition in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Republic of Macedonia fully supports the unity of Iraq. We also support the recent Security Council resolution 1770 (2007) regarding an extended role for the Organization in Iraq. Building peace and democracy in those two countries remains a key challenge both for the international community and for the Iraqis and Afghans themselves.  The Republic of Macedonia continues on its path towards a functional multi-ethnic democracy. There are many challenges on that path that we should tackle and obligations that we must fulfil. We are committed to comprehensive reforms in all segments of Macedonian society in order to obtain a date for the beginning of pre-accession negotiations for membership in the European Union in 2008. At the same time  bearing in mind the successful reforms that we have been implementing for years  we are deeply convinced that it would be realistic to obtain an invitation for membership of the Republic of Macedonia in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) at the next summit of that organization  scheduled for April 2008 in Bucharest.  The region of South-East Europe has come a long way in the past decade. We are all striving towards the common goal of European and Euro-Atlantic integration  which is a strong driving force in terms of reforms and final stabilization of the region. The Republic of Macedonia remains firmly committed to good-neighbourly relations and regional cooperation  and we believe that dialogue is of key importance for all outstanding issues in the interest of everyone in the region.  We continue to support the efforts of the international community regarding the resolution of the status of Kosovo. At this stage  the Republic of Macedonia hopes that the next round of negotiations and consultations led by the Troika will bring the positions of both parties closer. We also endorse the position that a resolution of the Kosovo issue should be formulated within a reasonable time frame  in the best interest of stability in the region and the region’s Euro-Atlantic perspective.  In that context  I would like to underline in particular that we do not agree with the recently mentioned idea of partition of Kosovo according to ethnic lines  since that might have serious negative implications for the entire region. The issue of the technical demarcation of our northern border with Kosovo according to a predefined procedure and agenda remains a top priority for the Republic of Macedonia.  Allow me to assure the Assembly that we will spare no efforts translating our words into actions  so that people around the world may be convinced of our commitment to respecting and implementing the principles and values enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  Finally with or without any points of order the name of my country is the Republic of Macedonia and will be the Republic of Macedonia. "
"114",4679,"MLT",62,2007,"I would like  first of all  to extend my congratulations to you  Sir  on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am convinced that you will guide the General Assembly through its important deliberations and challenges. I assure you of my full support and that of the Maltese delegation.   I also take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Maltese delegation to the outgoing President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her untiring work in facilitating a constructive dialogue among all the United Nations Member States.  Once again  the General Assembly is meeting to consider and debate international issues that impact on the heart and soul of the world populations. We are concerned with the life and survival of those that do not have a voice to cry out against the injustices  underdevelopment  human rights violations  gender discrimination  poverty  child labour and environmental degradation.  Malta applauds the efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who  since taking up his office  has validly been making a solid contribution towards a more secure world  which is â€œour shared responsibilityâ€.  The challenge of global climate change  particularly of global warming  induces me to make a few remarks about this environmental threat and its serious economic and social impacts which will impede progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. I am very proud of the fact that almost 20 years ago  in 1988  my country  Malta  raised awareness about the grave repercussions of climate change through an initiative which led the General Assembly to declare that ""climate change is the common concern of mankind"". Eventually  that initiative led to the adoption of the Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol.  I note with satisfaction the remarkable participation in last Monday's high-level event. The Secretary-General was unequivocal in outlining the challenge the world community is facing today. He said:   Much has happened since those early days. But the fundamental challenge remains unchanged  and has become even more pressing. Indeed  I am convinced that climate change  and what we do about it  will define us  our era  and ultimately the global legacy we leave for future generations.â€ (Press release GA/10619)  The disastrous effects on local populations that weather extremes are having as a result of global warming  such as Hurricane Dean  which  the Assembly will recall  devastated the economies and infrastructure of the island States of Dominica  Saint Lucia  Jamaica  Martinique and Guadeloupe  and other small island States in the Pacific and the Caribbean. All of that requires the United Nations to strengthen its leadership in dealing with natural disasters.  Malta believes that the issue of climate change and its repercussions must be addressed in a more cohesive and concerted manner among all the international institutions and organizations. It is imperative that all actors involved in climate risk reduction take a unified stand on a strategy and action to strengthen the resilience of affected countries in building their ability to face and adapt to the adverse impact of climate change.  Malta also believes that the United Nations should establish a mechanism through the General Assembly which will report on the activities in the field of climate change throughout the past 20 years and propose elements of a possible future global strategy which avoids the current fragmented approach and takes special account of the needs of small island States.  We owe such an effort to present and future generations. Malta looks forward to decisions at the Bali summit next December that we are sure will orient and accelerate action within the United Nations framework to obtain agreement on a comprehensive  effective  fair and urgent global strategy to limit climate change and adapt to its impacts.  In a few weeks time  Malta together with the international community will be celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the initiative launched also by Malta on the law of the sea  which  15 years later  saw the adoption of the United Nations Convention  declaring the seabed and its subsoil as the common heritage of mankind. Forty years after the launch of the Maltese initiative and 25 years after the adoption of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  we can safely state that this concept could also be appropriately applied to the global environment  with the knowledge that this priceless possession is owned by all human beings on this planet. The environment is our common area  our common heritage and as such it is our global concern. As States Members of the United Nations  we must work together to ensure that this precious possession is protected and enhanced.  The maintenance of a special focus on furthering dialogue  peace  stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean and the Middle East is one of the primary objectives of Malta's foreign policy. Together with other European Union member States as well as with our Mediterranean neighbours  Malta will continue to join in the calls for creating the necessary conditions for strengthening peace and cooperation in the region. Malta's participation in the Euro-Mediterranean Barcelona Partnership  the Five plus Five Summit  the Mediterranean Forum  the Euro-Med Parliamentary Assembly and the Parliamentary Assembly for the Mediterranean complement Malta's long-standing vocation and commitment to  and understanding of  the Mediterranean region. Malta is proud to host the headquarters of the newly established Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean which will meet for the first time in my country this November  launching a new dimension of discussions on Mediterranean affairs.  Close to Mediterranean affairs in the order of priorities is the Middle East  with the Palestinian question at its core. Malta intends to continue  as it has done for many decades now  to support efforts to bring lasting peace in the Middle East. We find the economic and social repercussions on the living conditions of the Palestinian people worrisome. We remain concerned about the security of the State of Israel and of the Israeli people. We are troubled by the continuing violence between Israelis and Palestinians  as well as among Palestinians  violence that continues to claim innocent lives on both sides. Malta will persist in working with the United Nations and the concerned parties for a two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian question. Malta supports the decision of Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Abbas to meet regularly in their quest for a durable and long-lasting solution. We also welcome the appointment of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair as the special representative of the Quartet and the initiative of President Bush to convene a major meeting on the issue in November of this year.  A centrepiece of our Organization is the protection of human rights worldwide. The Human Rights Council's first year of existence has witnessed the successful conclusion of its institution-building process. Malta predicts that the universal periodic review will become an effective and a proactive mechanism that not only provides an appraisal of Member States' human rights records but also encourages further achievements.  Malta welcomes the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the General Assembly (resolution 61/295). Linked to the promotion and protection of human rights is the right to life. It is Maltaâ€™s belief that the abolition of the death penalty would enhance respect for the protection of the right to life. Malta also commends and welcomes the Secretary-General's decision to appoint a Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide with the â€œresponsibility to protectâ€ and with an expanded mandate to cover cases of mass atrocities.  This year is the tenth anniversary of the Rome Statute which established the International Criminal Court. Malta reiterates its full support and commitment. My country intends to work with the United Nations and the States parties to the Rome Statute  to ensure that the International Criminal Court strengthens its tools in the administration of justice  reconciliation and the promotion of the rule of law and democracy.  Two weeks ago  the international community joined the people of the City of New York to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre. While grieving with those who have lost their loved ones and with all the people of the United States  we reaffirm our commitment with States Members of the United Nations in the fight against terrorism. The completion of negotiations on a United Nations comprehensive convention against international terrorism would complement and strengthen the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the Secretary-General's Counter-Terrorism Committee Implementation Task Force in addressing the threat of terrorism to global peace and security.  Allow me to touch on another subject. The plight of internally displaced persons and those who are seeking a better life elsewhere has continued to be one of the priority issues of the international community. Indeed  Malta has for some time now been witnessing that tragic human migration  caused primarily by internal conflicts  poverty and underdevelopment  and resulting in a large influx of asylum seekers arriving irregularly on our small island State  which  at 1 200 persons per square kilometre  has one of the highest population densities in the world. The impact on us is therefore enormous.  I would like to reiterate the calls made by Malta in this same Assembly last year for a concerted response from the international community  as well as from the United Nations  its institutions and organizations  particularly the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  in addressing the problem appropriately and adequately. The response should be undertaken particularly by combating the criminal organizations that are financially benefiting from illegal immigration while they put the lives of those same immigrants at risk  and by providing special assistance to those countries which  like Malta  carry a disproportionate burden in addressing the phenomenon.  Malta hopes that the High-Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development held last year and the follow-up meetings will continue to find support in establishing a comprehensive institutional and holistic response to international migration and solutions that I hope will be based on the values of solidarity  on respect for human dignity  and on the sharing of responsibility.  In a month's time  the United Nations will be hosting the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development with a view to reviewing the six areas of the Monterrey Consensus. The detailed report of the Secretary-General recommends a series of policies for action by United Nations Member States and other stakeholders in advancing and consolidating economic growth  sustainable development  and social progress. As rightly pointed out by the Secretary-General   The Monterrey Consensus embodies a major commitment to keeping fully engaged at all levels  and to continuing to build bridges among development  finance and trade organizations and initiatives (A/62/217  para. 127).  In that context  the roles of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are crucial. In addition  the conclusion of negotiations on the Doha development agenda would significantly contribute to the sustainable development of developing countries.  In order to ensure that the United Nations is better equipped to accomplish the mission and mandates given to it by its principal organs  the ongoing process of reform has to be accelerated. The World Summit in 2005 agreed on a number of reforms  and especially on the need to restructure the main United Nations bodies  including the General Assembly  the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council. Progress has been made  but  I submit  more progress has still to be achieved. Malta is an advocate of a stronger United Nations that is representative of the whole membership  transparent in its role and actions  and accountable  efficient and effective in its management.  It is also in that context that Malta strongly supports efforts to strengthen the system-wide coherence of the United Nations operational development activities. The reform of the United Nations and the proposed establishment of the â€œOne United Nationsâ€ country approach are  in Maltaâ€™s view  two important pillars on which our Organization can appropriately address the new and growing challenges it is facing. Member States must give the United Nations a new face  a stronger meaning and an innovative way of thinking  implementing and acting.  The United Nations  our Organization  must be given the ability to respond  the capacity to effectively coordinate and deliver  and the means to truly reflect the aspirations of its whole membership.

"115",4725,"MMR",62,2007,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate the President on his assumption of the high office of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I would also like to convey Myanmar’s appreciation to his predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa  for her able stewardship of the previous session. The annual report of the Secretary-General reflects the significant work done in the past year by the United Nations in meeting the challenges we face. We congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his successful first year in office and welcome his timely initiative with regard to such pressing global issues as climate change. The High-level Event on Climate Change has reignited the international community’s interest in climate change  and rightly so. Climate change remains the most critical challenge that the international community faces today. The adverse effects of climate change  such as sea-level rise  hurricanes  floods  drought and desertification  particularly in recent years  are a stark reminder of the negative impact that climate change has on the long-term economic and social development of the global community  particularly the developing countries.   To address the adverse impacts of climate change  we need concerted action at the national  regional and international levels. We need to be mindful that climate change is not merely an environmental issue  but also a sustainable development issue. Accordingly  an integrated and coordinated approach is required. For its part  Myanmar is pursuing a national environmental policy based on the sustainable utilization of natural resources. In 1991  we adopted the Myanmar Agenda 21  which serves as an important guideline for both the public and private sectors.  Myanmar also pursues a system of sustainable forest management. We have implemented a nationwide programme of afforestation and reforestation. As a result  we have been able to retain a forest cover of 50 per cent in the country. Myanmar was among the 12 nations that took part in the Asia Least-cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy in cooperation with the Asian Development Bank. The inventory of greenhouse gas emissions taken under the Strategy confirms that Myanmar is more of a sink than a source of carbon dioxide emissions. The baseline projection of the 2020 national greenhouse inventory also shows that the forestry sector will continue to be a significant sink in Myanmar in the future.  The economic activities undertaken by developed countries  both historically and currently  are mainly responsible for the emissions of greenhouse gases that affect the global climate system. The developing countries  which are least responsible for contributing to climate change  face the greatest risk from its adverse impacts. Addressing the challenge of climate change requires an integrated approach to economic growth  social development and environmental protection. Concerted action must be taken within the framework of the internationally agreed United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol  based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It will require developed countries to provide new and additional financial resources to developing countries and to fulfil the commitments made at various international conferences.  The impact of climate change is particularly felt in developing countries and has adversely affected national development prospects. In order to effectively meet the challenge of climate change  we would also have to address poverty alleviation; then and only then would the developing countries be able to achieve internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals. It is  therefore  incumbent on the developed countries  whose development process rely heavily on the natural resource acquired from the developing countries  to provide the necessary financial resource.  Underdevelopment and mass deprivations lead to economic  political and social hardships in developing countries. Development provides an environment conducive to democracy. I would like to call upon the entire international community to work together for poverty alleviation.  The scourge of terrorism knows no boundaries. Combating terrorism is the common endeavour of the entire international community. I would like to stress here that terrorism in any form or manifestation must be rejected. It is the innocent people who bear the brunt of terrorist activities. To combat terrorism effectively  we also must address its root causes. Poverty  grievances and underlying political  economic and social conditions provide fertile ground for the spread of terrorism. These root causes of terrorism must be addressed.  Friendly relations among nations should be based on respect for the principles of equal rights and self-determination. Countries should show goodwill  practice tolerance and live together in peace and harmony. Nations have various historical backgrounds  differing cultures  and different religions and customs. Nations are not identical. However  respecting those basic principles and practicing friendship and goodwill will effectively contribute to our common endeavour to combat terrorism.  Today  the world is facing diverse problems and daunting challenges. The United Nations  which represents the world community  is called upon to resolve them. Our Organization was formed in order to maintain international peace and security  develop friendly relations among nations and promote cooperation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character. In order to effectively address the full range of challenges  the reform of the United Nations  as called for by our leaders in the World Summit Outcome  must be successfully implemented.  I am confident  Mr. President  that under your able leadership we will make significant progress in the United Nations reform process  taking into consideration the position of the vast majority of the membership.  We are greatly disturbed to witness neocolonialism rearing its ugly head in recent years. The strategies employed are obvious. As a first step  the neocolonialists conduct media campaigns against the targeted country and spread disinformation that the country concerned is committing gross human rights violations. They portray these campaigns as a fight for democracy. Secondly  they impose sanctions  which hinder economic development and cause poverty among the people. Here I would like to stress that economic sanctions are counterproductive and can only delay the path to democracy. As a third step  they provide political  financial and other material support in order to create unrest in the country. Finally  under the pretext that a country is undemocratic and unstable and that it poses a threat to international peace and security  they intervene directly and invade the country. Current events clearly show that such a course of action can only result in conflict and untold suffering for the people of the country.  My country is currently subjected to such courses of action. The international community should also be wary of those neocolonialist attempts. Here it must be stressed that the destiny of each and every country can only be determined by its Government and its own people. It cannot be imposed from outside. On our part  we are determined to proceed resolutely towards democracy along our chosen path.  In the life of every nation  there are times when it must face challenging situations and overcome them. Myanmar has gone through such a challenge recently. The situation would not have deteriorated  if the initial protest of a small group of activists against the rise in fuel prices had not been exploited by political opportunists. They sought to turn the situation into a political showdown  aided and abetted by certain powerful countries. They also took advantage of protests staged initially by a small group of Buddhist clergy demanding an apology for the maltreatment of monks by local authorities. The security personnel exercised the utmost restraint and did not intervene for nearly a month. However  when the mob became unruly and provocative  they were compelled to declare a curfew. Subsequently  when protestors ignored their warnings  they had to take action to restore the situation. Normalcy has now returned to Myanmar.  The rule of law is a fundamental principle accepted by nations. Without it there can be neither the orderly conduct of the day-to-day affairs of State nor the enjoyment of human rights and democracy by the people.  Myanmar is a multi-ethnic and multireligious society. It is home to over 100 national races who have lived together in weal or woe over the centuries. National unity is of paramount importance to us. We have  therefore  been striving to strengthen the fabric of our nation. In keeping with the aspirations of the people for democratization  a seven-step road map was declared  and a national convention was held to lay down the principles for a new constitution. Work was concluded on 3 September 2007  adopting by consensus the fundamental principles for the new constitution. Based on these principles  a draft constitution will be drawn up by legal experts. All the remaining steps will be implemented phase by phase.  This process is applauded by the people. To date  people in 11 townships have convened rallies in support of the successful conclusion of the national convention. Townships all over the country are expected to hold similar rallies.  Recent events make clear that there are elements within and outside the country that wish to de-rail the ongoing process so that they can take advantage of the chaos that would follow. They have become more and more emboldened and have stepped up their campaign to confront the Government.  The Myanmar Government is fully aware of its responsibility to lead the nation in the process of transformation to a disciplined democracy. We have laid out a road map and will work conscientiously to achieve our goals. Significant progress has already been made. The process can be successfully completed  sooner rather than later  if no obstacles are placed in our path. In this regard  the international community can best help Myanmar by showing greater understanding. They can begin by refraining from measures which would result in adding fuel to the fire.  One area where the international community can demonstrate good faith and objectivity is to acknowledge the good work done in Myanmar in combating the scourge of narcotic drugs. As a result of our efforts to rid our country of those drugs by the year 2014  the production of opium has plummeted to unprecedented levels. In the World Drug Report 2006  the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported that in 2005 the total area under opium poppy cultivation showed a decrease of 26 per cent when compared to that of 2004. The World Drug Report 2007 confirms that in 2006 the total area under opium poppy cultivation was approximately 21 500 hectares  representing a decrease of 34 per cent compared to 2005. Here  I would like to stress that in terms of opium production  the decline is 88 per cent over a span of eight years  declining from 2 560 tons to an estimated 292 tons.  Myanmar regards the eradication of narcotic drugs as a national priority. We have enhanced our enforcement capacity and have been providing alternative livelihoods to farmers to encourage them to end their dependence on opium poppy cultivation. We are also taking effective measures with regard to the emerging threat posed by methamphetamine-type stimulant drugs. Myanmar neither produces nor imports the precursor chemicals required for the production of those drugs.  Cooperation with the United Nations is a cornerstone of Myanmar’s foreign policy. It is in this spirit that we continue to cooperate with the Secretary-General with regard to his good offices role mandated by the General Assembly. We have agreed to the visit of his Special Adviser  Under-Secretary-General Ibrahim Gambari  who is presently in my country. We will continue to work closely and cooperate actively with the United Nations. "
"116",4736,"MNE",62,2007," Allow me   Mr. President  to join others in welcoming you and congratulating you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are convinced that your leadership will contribute to promoting both your country and our entire region  as well as to a successful outcome at the current session.  May I also extend wholehearted congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon. He can count on the full support of Montenegro  as the youngest Member of the United Nations. Particular thanks go also to Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her successful presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session.  It is time for all countries   and particularly smaller and developing countries   to realize that multilateralism is the pre-eminent form of interaction in our changing world. Multilateralism provides a framework for choosing democratic  development and cultural options that can most effectively meet the major challenges ahead  including the maintenance of peace and security  climate change  development processes  the fight against terrorism and the protection of human rights.  Mindful of the importance of multilateral organizations  in particular the United Nations  Montenegro stands ready to actively participate in making those principles a reality. As a society that is implementing major structural economic and social reforms  we understand and support the reform processes taking place under the auspices of the Organization. Furthermore  as a Member State  we are aware of our obligation to respect the international legal order and to contribute to the consolidation of peace and democracy in the international community.  Good-neighbourly relations and regional cooperation  as integral components of the processes of European and Euro-Atlantic integration  form the basis of Montenegro’s foreign policy. We strongly believe that Montenegro and the Western Balkans clearly have a European future. In that context  we support the efforts of all of our neighbours to adopt and implement European standards and values.  In mid-October  we shall sign a stabilization and association agreement with the European Union (EU)  thus establishing the first contractual relationship between Montenegro and the Union. That will complete the current phase of intensive activities on our path towards Europe  which will enable us to enter a new and enhanced phase in our European relations. It is in that context that we view our recent accession to the Partnership for Peace initiative. Our commitment to European and Euro-Atlantic integration has been reaffirmed in all the strategic documents that we have adopted since the restoration of our independence.  Many development processes are now taking place in Montenegro: an expansion of our open-market economy  the transformation of ownership structures and reform of our public sector  judicial and security structures. Our institutional reforms and development programmes  which have been the focus of our political activities during the current phase  are guided by the principles of European and Euro-Atlantic integration  which are a guarantee of stability and prosperity. It is with a full sense of responsibility that we are creating an environment that ensures the rule of law  equality and respect for human  minority and religious rights. In that way we can contribute to regional stability as well.  Although we are a small State  we stand ready to contribute  to the best of our ability  to the establishment of conditions that will enable the region to continue along the path of mutual trust  enhanced stabilization and unhindered cooperation.  By becoming independent  Montenegro has taken charge of its integration into the system of international relations as an equal partner and has shouldered its responsibility for the maintenance of peace  security and stability in the region  while building an open and democratic civil society.  In that context  we believe that the direct negotiations that have begun on Kosovo’s future status will be fruitful. Montenegro strongly supports that negotiating process  in which the international community has invested considerable effort  convinced that it will lead to a lasting and sustainable solution that will contribute to the strengthening and preservation of regional stability over the long term.  Montenegro is particularly sensitive to the theme underlying the sixty-second session of the General Assembly: our response to climate change. As the Secretary-General stated in paragraph 8 of his report on the work of the Organization (A/62/1)  “[C]limate change  and what we do about it  will define us  our era  and ultimately our global legacy”. Here  the idea of the world as a global village  an indivisible whole  is perhaps most evident. Without a common approach  there can be no correct response. No one has the right to remain indifferent to this challenge  either individually or in global terms. The negative impacts of climate change could be many. It could affect countries such as my own in ways that include a rise in the level of the Adriatic Sea  rising temperatures and damage to forest and other ecosystems and to biodiversity. In that context  Montenegro is making efforts to keep pace with global trends  contributing to endeavours to ensure better living conditions and a more humane environment for us and future generations. We are carrying out many activities and projects to that end  including efforts in fulfilment of our international obligations. We have ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol  and we have begun to prepare our first report on implementation of the Protocol. We also recently adopted a national sustainable development strategy and are now establishing a network of public institutions to plan activities related to the challenges of climate change.   Mindful of our country’s natural resources and of our responsibility to preserve them  the parliament of the Republic of Montenegro decided in 1991 to declare Montenegro an ecological State. As an ecological State  Montenegro has an additional obligation to support United Nations efforts to promote sustainable development throughout the world. Through robust efforts  we shall continue to strengthen Montenegro as a State that guarantees sustainable development for its citizens.  We therefore welcome the efforts of the United Nations and particularly of the Secretary-General in this area. We are encouraged by the messages emanating from the present General Assembly session and the recent high-level event on climate change. We hope that those messages will contribute significantly to the success of the Bali process in December and that the Bali Climate Change Conference will produce additional constructive proposals and sustainable solutions  particularly with regard to the post-2012 goals.  In recent months  we have seen the United Nations continue to make significant efforts in hot spots throughout the world. The contributions made by the United Nations in Darfur alone have repeatedly demonstrated the Organization’s capacity to adapt and to play its appropriate role in today’s world.  We therefore believe that the United Nations is capable of undertaking comprehensive reform of its system to respond to the increasingly complex challenges facing it. Given the importance of the Organization to world peace and security  the modalities of such reform should result in a stronger  more organized  better coherent and more effective United Nations.  We are of the view that effective coordination among the principal United Nations organs is vital. We have seen some progress in this area since the 2005 World Summit.   Another essential aspect of United Nations reform is reform of the General Assembly  which remains the primary decision-making organ of the United Nations. Work on that aspect  together with others  must be intensified and made more results-oriented.  The same thing applies to the ongoing debate on reform of the Economic and Social Council and  in particular  of the Security Council. Equitable representation for the Group of Eastern European States  to which we belong  should be guaranteed in that important organ.  For a small country like Montenegro  effective cooperation with the United Nations is crucial. We are therefore most interested in being the agent and promoter of that cooperation  be it through the One United Nations Initiative or through a similar modality. Our commitment to cooperation with the United Nations is also demonstrated by the project to build the first United Nations eco-building as the focal point for all United Nations activities in Montenegro.  As a developing country  Montenegro looks forward to the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development and to the successful conclusion of the Doha Round negotiations  which we hope will lend fresh impetus to bringing together economic  financial and social issues with the aim of achieving comprehensive progress and development. The world today faces a multitude of challenges in this area. Montenegro stands ready to contribute to the global partnership for development.  In that context  Montenegro will continue its activities conducive to the full implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  for we are convinced that in that way we will contribute to improving quality of life and overall stability.  With a view to meeting the legitimate security interests of nations  we must be united and decisive in tackling terrorism  which continues to threaten the world. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its Plan of Action (resolution 60/288) are of great importance  and call for agreement on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.  Montenegro will continue to demonstrate its full and unequivocal commitment to  and compliance with  international obligations through its cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). We shall continue our concrete cooperation with the ICTY  contributing not only to the rule of law but also to implementing the Tribunal’s completion strategy.  We shall continue to craft our policies and to work towards our development on the basis of the principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which represent the foundations of modern democracy. We therefore view the United Nations as the most important forum for achieving progress  a more equitable future and a community of equal nations.  Our country is proud of its multi-ethnic and multiconfessional harmony. That is one of our cherished values  which distinguishes Montenegro in the regional and broader international context. With our traditions and culture  Montenegro is part of the age-old historical currents of the Balkans  the Mediterranean and Europe. We are at the crossroads of civilizations and religions  and share the intertwined influences emanating from them. We want to preserve and enhance that legacy by working together not only with our neighbours but also with all other countries with which we share such advantages of geography  culture and values.  The world Organization is the only true global forum  because it reflects all the diversity and qualities of its Members  which are united by principles and values that  after 62 years  continue to serve as a beacon in an increasingly changing and dynamic world. Following that course while being prepared to change is an imperative for us all. "
"117",4782,"MNG",62,2007,"We are at the middle of the road  halfway towards the 2015 deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Eight years are left   is that much? Are we keeping the pace? Measured against the history of the human race it is but a sand particle in an hourglass. But measured against the hopes and expectations of millions of people living in abject poverty with no access to clean water  for children with little prospect of gaining an education and reaching their full potential in life  for women dying in childbirth  for infants who will never learn how to walk or talk or read and write  who are taken away by preventable diseases   that surely amounts to much more than a sand particle.  By 2015 our peoples will judge whether the pledges and commitments made by their leaders and the international community as a whole were genuine. They shall ascertain whether the conferences and illustrious gatherings of the world leaders stand for actual deeds or whether they simply equal empty words and hollow promises. The eight years towards 2015 are thus a litmus test of our credibility. To pass the test or not is  therefore  upon us. We must deliver what we pledged. We must achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed development goals. We must exert our best efforts individually as nations and we must exert them collectively as the international community.  In order to do this  we must now look back at our individual progress so far. We must take stock of what has already been achieved and what is yet to be done to achieve the Goals on time. My country  Mongolia  is intimately monitoring its own progress on the path towards achieving the MDGs. The second national report on MDG implementation in Mongolia has only recently been considered by the national Government.  Implementation of the MDGs is about meeting the basic needs of the people and securing their social and personal welfare  and my Government is very serious about delivering them for our people. Unfortunately  despite the considerable efforts made  success is still far from assured on a number of goals and  first and foremost  on the goal to halve poverty.  On a global scale  the MDG progress report of 2007 revealed the same mixed picture. The report made a strong case for concerted additional action to be taken immediately and sustained until 2015 if the world is to attain the MDGs. It argued that the lack of any significant increase in official development assistance since 2004 makes it impossible  even for well-governed countries  to meet the MDGs.  Against that backdrop  I lend my full backing and support to the proposal of the President of the General Assembly to have an MDG leaders’ meeting here at the United Nations. Such a meeting must  in our view  not only serve as a midterm review mechanism  but also coin concrete proposals and recommendations on the way forward.  We are fully aware of our primary responsibility for our own development  yet there are factors well beyond our control that impede progress  and climate change figures prominently among them. Climate change is definitely no longer a subject of pure scientific and academic discourse. Nations large and small  coastal and landlocked alike  are feeling its effects on their economies and the livelihoods of their peoples. The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicated that poor countries will be the hardest hit by climate change  in spite of the fact that they contribute the least to the phenomenon. Is that fair?  The contribution of my country to global warming is negligible at best  yet Mongolia is severely affected by the negative consequences of climate change. To give but a few examples  over the past 60 years the average temperature in Mongolia has risen by almost 2°C  compared to a rise in the global mean temperature of about 1°C over the last century. Some 80 per cent of the land surface has been degraded   mostly by wind erosion combined with human activities  including mining and overgrazing by livestock. Desertification is rampant. Pastures that support the semi-nomadic lifestyle of Mongols have decreased and become more fragile. Over the past 40 years  soil fertility has decreased by a factor of two to three. The country has been subject to the ever-more frequent occurrence of natural disasters  such as drought and dzud   cold winters with heavy  snowfalls   in recent years  which have had a severe impact on the pastoral economy of the country.  Fair or not  no country can stand aside or afford inaction in the face of such truly global challenges like climate change. We all must carry our share of the common endeavour  yet it is only natural that those who contribute the most to global warming bear the bulk of the burden. Hence  the industrialized countries should fulfil their commitments to taking the lead in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and to providing financial resources and transferring clean technologies to developing countries.  The comprehensive implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol remains a priority even as the international community embarks on the road towards shaping the post-Kyoto framework. The post-Kyoto framework should be flexible and diverse  taking into consideration circumstances in each country. It must include all the major emitters and achieve compatibility between environmental protection and economic growth by utilizing advances in technologies to the greatest extent possible.  The United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Bali in December will have a crucial role in shaping such a future framework. We must seize the opportunity and fully utilize the current session of the General Assembly to build the groundwork for the Bali Conference.  Regional and subregional mechanisms should also be mobilized as complementary and supplementary instruments to global efforts. Mongolia  a North-East Asian country  attaches particular importance to developing environmental cooperation mechanisms in the subregion  as dust and sand storms originating in the expanding Gobi desert have become a familiar phenomenon for inhabitants of Beijing  Seoul  Tokyo and beyond.  North-East Asia is one of the most dynamic and diverse regions of the world. It contains some of the world’s major economic powerhouses  such as China  Japan  the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation  along with the smaller and more vulnerable economies of Mongolia and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The subregion is also home to a quarter of the world’s population. The sheer size and diversity of the subregion mean that climate change manifestations are wide-ranging  yet intimately felt in each and every country.  Mongolia has therefore come up with an initiative to hold a North-East Asian summit on climate change in the nearest future. We hope that such a high-level event will achieve a breakthrough in regional cooperation on climate change and serve as a tangible contribution to global efforts.  Nationally  Mongolia has been making continuous efforts to address the challenges posed by climate change by appropriately improving its legal environment and actively implementing various programmes and projects. In 1996  a national action plan to combat desertification was adopted. In 1999  we established a national climate change committee entrusted with formulating national policy on adaptation to climate change and reduction of greenhouse gases  preparing reports on national greenhouse gas inventories  policies and measures. In 2000  the Government of Mongolia launched its national action programme on climate change aimed not only at meeting UNFCCC obligations  but also at setting priorities for action and integrating climate change concerns into other national and sectoral development plans and programmes.  Furthermore  our MDG-based national development strategy  the draft of which was recently submitted to Parliament for its consideration and approval  contains a separate chapter on environmental policy. It identifies the protection of nature and the environment  the reasonable use of natural resources  and climate change concerns among national priority goals. The draft strategy is expected to be approved by Parliament this autumn.  On a more practical side  in 2005 my Government launched a major programme on agroforestry development  entitled Green Belt  in an attempt to combat desertification  stop sand movement  and  reduce dust and sand storms. Upon its completion  a great green wall will extend for 2 500 kilometres from the East to the West of the country  shielding the steppes from the Gobi desert.  In the energy sector  which is mostly based on fossil fuels  particularly coal  the Government is making continued efforts to introduce an alternative or renewable source of energy. To that effect  the construction of hydro-power plants has started  along with the implementation of the 100 000 Solar Ger programme.  The landlocked geographical situation of my country is an additional hurdle for our development efforts and MDG implementation. Indeed  our lack of territorial access to the sea  remoteness from world markets  and subsequent high transportation costs and undue delays are major impediments to the trade of landlocked developing countries. Higher trade costs reduce a country’s welfare and inhibit economic growth by making imports expensive and exports uncompetitive.  Hence  Mongolia  together with other like-minded countries  has endeavoured to raise the awareness of the international community of the need for support and assistance for land-locked developing countries and to promote the common position and interests of the group at both the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. Here  I wish to highlight the importance of the meeting of trade ministers of land-locked developing countries and the thematic meeting of land-locked developing countries and their transit neighbours on trade and trade facilitation issues  held last month in Ulaanbaatar  the capital city of Mongolia  for setting the priorities of the group in the context of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations and in the lead-up to the midterm review of the Almaty Programme of Action.  Security concerns continue to affect global development. Despite our best efforts  the world around us is still not a safe place for many. Millions suffer on a daily basis from hunger  illness  insecurity and the threat of violence. Thousands and thousands perish in sectarian violence  terrorist attacks and internal conflicts  with thousands more having fled violence  thus augmenting the growing ranks of refugees and internally displaced persons. All this invariably takes a heavy toll on the development aspirations of the affected countries.  Many of us come from countries not ravaged by conflicts or from regions that lie thousands of miles from conflict zones  yet  in this age of globalization  none of us remains unaffected. Record-setting oil prices triggered by the situation in the Middle East have a profound impact on the world economy. Small  vulnerable and commodity-dependent economies  such as that of Mongolia  are hit hardest  along with other oil-importing developing countries. However  it is ordinary people in the Middle East who bear the brunt of the suffering. The international community must deliver a promise of peace and security to the peoples of Iraq  Israel  Palestine  Darfur and other conflict zones.  We must continue our global fight against terrorism  with the United Nations at the helm of that collective effort. The recent hostage crisis in Afghanistan came as a sobering reminder of the threat still posed by the Taliban. It proved once again that terrorists prey on those who cannot fight back. Thus  it is our solemn duty to offer protection to those who cannot defend themselves.  Mongolia  a country with internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free status  is pleased with the progress achieved in the six-party talks on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  the latest round of which took place last week in Beijing. As its contribution to advancing the six-party talks  on 4 and 5 September Mongolia hosted a bilateral working group session on the normalization of relations between Japan and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea this year  and stands ready to continue such efforts in the future.  Mongolia is heartened at the news about the forthcoming inter-Korean summit meeting  to start tomorrow. We are hopeful that it will contribute to the cause of bringing about peace  security  and eventually a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. In light of the promising political dynamics in the subregion  Mongolia is optimistic that its early call for a multilateral security cooperation mechanism in North-East Asia will gain support in the subregion and beyond.  With scores of countries having embarked in recent decades on a path towards establishing modern and functioning democratic societies built upon the principles of pluralism  respect for human rights  freedom of the press and democratic governance  democracy has been firmly established as a truly universal value.  We in Mongolia believe that democracy is the best possible environment for sustained economic growth. Democracy and respect for human rights have been  in our view  inherently woven into the MDGs. Proceeding from that premise  in 2005 Mongolia was the first country to adopt a ninth MDG on strengthening human rights and fostering democratic governance.  We are proud of its successful democratic transition  with major gains in the political  economic  social and spiritual areas of our societal life. Yet  as a young democracy  my country is also intimately aware of the complex challenges faced by countries in transition. We believe in international cooperation and support for democratization efforts. In that regard  Mongolia applauds the increased role of the United Nations in fostering democracy and good governance  not only through assistance in holding credible elections  but through a wide range of activities to promote democratic institutions and practices. The United Nations Democracy Fund  which has already funded over 100 projects around the globe  is a notable example. The United Nations has also been an important stakeholder in the success of the new or restored democracies process.  Global challenges require global approaches  and no other body is better equipped to serve as the steering house of the collective efforts of the international community than the United Nations. The United Nations is the world’s most universal  legitimate and authoritative organization. It is a true political centre of global cooperation. It gives us legitimacy. It gives us legality.  Our world Organization has embarked on a process of reform in order to better respond to the multifaceted challenges  both existing and emerging  in this era of rapid globalization and its ensuing growing complexities. Progress has been made in several reform areas  yet greater efforts  combined with stronger political will  are needed to follow through with reforms related especially to the system-wide coherence of the United Nations and the Security Council. Mongolia has full confidence in Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and supports his efforts aimed at improving the management  efficiency and internal cohesion of the United Nations system.  Our success as a community of nations in tackling the challenges of climate change  achieving the MDGs and other internationally agreed development goals  countering terrorism  preventing conflicts  promoting democracy and human rights  and effectively addressing other pressing issues of today largely depends on the success of that transformation.  The clock is ticking. We cannot afford to pursue business as usual. If we are to honour  in good faith and on time  the pledges and commitments we made to our peoples  we must redouble our concerted efforts to win this historic race. "
"118",4823,"MOZ",62,2007,"On behalf of  the people and the Government of the Republic of Mozambique and  indeed  on my own behalf  I would like to associate myself with the previous speakers in congratulating you most warmly on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are confident that with your experience and wise leadership  as demonstrated throughout your remarkable academic and diplomatic career at the service of your country  and with the support of us all  the deliberations of this session will be crowned with success.  Mr. President  my delegation would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her dedication and the innovative manner with which she presided over the deliberations of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  We also wish to reiterate our special tribute to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his election to this post  and we salute him for his commitment to the continued search for solutions to the many challenges faced by humanity  and for his hard work on behalf of our Organization. Mr. Secretary-General  we would like to reaffirm our full readiness to continue cooperating with you for the successful discharge of your difficult but noble mission.  We commend the selection of the theme of climate change as the main discussion topic for this session  as it is an urgent and important issue for our countries and for the future of our planet. Thanks to the revolution in convergence technology in the areas of informatics  broadcasting and telecommunications  with implications for time and space compression  we have been following with emotion and on a regular basis  and in some instances in real time  the effects of climate change on our planet. We have witnessed the reduction in the availability of water resources and the tragic consequences for human beings  fauna and flora; the increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme meteorological phenomena  such as extreme temperatures  earthquakes and tsunamis  resulting in the occurrence of natural disasters whose consequences are incalculable; the reduction of glaciers and the rise of sea level; to mention but a few of the potential impacts of climate change  the full effects of which are yet to be clearly determined.  The impact of these phenomena is felt more harshly in developing countries  such as ours  given our deficient forecasting capacity in terms of human and technical resources. When these disasters strike our countries  our limitations and our lack of capacity to face them become more obvious. Examples of such limitations include: a lack of infrastructure  such as roads and bridges  preventing rescue personnel from providing timely assistance  even to citizens at great risk; a lack of means to assist the victims; and a lack of resources to mitigate the suffering of the survivors.   Given that we live in a global village  the effects of climate change are also felt in developed countries. Phenomena never before recorded with the magnitude and frequency with which they manifest themselves today are beginning to be a cause of concern for the citizens of these countries.  To digress a little from the discussion at hand  we would like to express our solidarity with and compassion to all victims of the natural disasters that have affected different regions of the planet in recent years. In honour of the victims of these disasters  let us all reaffirm our commitment to continue together to strive for a better world  a world free of these threats to human life and possessions  and to fauna and flora.  That is a collective commitment and aspiration that we have already assumed through several instruments  such as the Rio Declaration  Agenda 21 and the Kyoto Protocol. More than ever  and in the face of recurrent and increasingly devastating tragedies  there is a need for the involvement of all the members of the international community in the implementation of the global actions provided for in these joint undertakings.  By the same token  we should ensure that the three pillars of sustainable development  namely  economic development  social development and the protection of the environment should be approached and tackled by all of us  in an integrated  coordinated and balanced manner. Let us all keep in mind the strong relationship between these commitments and our collective desire to attain the Millennium Development Goals.  We note with great satisfaction that the international community continues to be committed to addressing  in a structured and sustainable manner  the challenges imposed by climate change. In this context  we welcome the decisions on climate change taken by the Heads of State and Government of Group of Eight (G-8) at their last summit held in June of this year in Germany.  We would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General  for his initiative in appointing three eminent persons as Special Envoys on Climate Change. The convening of the High-level Event on Climate Change  just two days ago here in this General Assembly Hall  opens up new prospects for the renewed momentum necessary for substantial progress to be made during the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change  scheduled for December of this year in Bali  Indonesia.  We are hopeful that this Conference will build consensus on future actions  including concrete targets aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions  and a post-Kyoto agreement to be binding on all nations. May this Conference not frustrate expectations  particularly those of the developing countries.  It is our hope that in Bali consensus will be reached in some key areas. First  we would like to see the provision of funding of the national action plans for adaptation to climate change  proposed by developing countries parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. The second element is the Adaptation Fund  established in conformity with the Kyoto Protocol  to provide assistance for developing countries  in particular the least developed countries  in the funding of their adaptation activities. The third is the implementation of the Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures.  Mozambique is a country prone to various types of natural disasters  which cyclically have resulted in the loss of human lives  the destruction of huge agricultural areas  property and social and economic infrastructures and increased soil erosion and a decrease in or outright loss of biodiversity.  This state of affairs is aggravated by the shortage of physical infrastructures for water management  such as dams and dykes  and for food conservation  such as silos. In addition  over 70 per cent of our population lives in rural areas  and natural resources are their principal source of livelihood. Hence the need for sustainable use that does not jeopardize the country’s environmental balance.  Because of this permanent vulnerability  environmental issues in general  and climate change in particular  form an integral part of the Government agenda. Particular attention is thus given to reducing the vulnerability of citizens to famine caused by drought  reducing human and property losses  mitigating the suffering of the population as a result of disasters and ensuring quick and harmonious reconstruction processes.  The activities under way include mapping the areas at risk  improving the early warning system  improving the conditions for the population to store agricultural produce  the provision of training and civic education for our citizens on natural disasters and their impact on the life of the country and the establishment of a national emergency operations centre  which operates 24 hours a day non-stop.  The introduction and implementation of these measures give priority to and rely on the active participation of our citizens. For us  the involvement of our citizens  who are the primary and ultimate beneficiaries of these governmental actions  is a key factor in ensuring the success of activities aimed at the preservation of the environment and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. The positive impact of these actions was in evidence and widely acknowledged during the recent floods  cyclones and high tides that we experienced earlier this year. These measures were recently put to the test once again  when a warning was sounded on the possibility of a tsunami.  In recognition of the fact that the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and the prevention and reduction of natural disasters require the engagement of the international community  the importance of strengthening regional  continental and international coordination cannot be overemphasized. In the framework of the report of the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence in the areas of development  humanitarian assistance and the environment (A/61/583)  we advocate the strengthening of the Global Environment Facility within the United Nations system. We thus encourage the United Nations to enhance its institutional capacity and resources to better assist Member States to incorporate adequate environmental policies in their national development strategies. In this regard  special attention should be given to developing countries with limited resources to fund their national capacity-building for dealing with issues related to climate change.  From this rostrum we once again call upon all United Nations Member States to accede to and fully implement all the instruments that have been adopted to revert and mitigate the impact of climate change. These instruments include the Kyoto Protocol  Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration  whose contents were reaffirmed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development  held in Johannesburg in 2002.  As members of the United Nations family  we have the historic responsibility of securing a bright future for our children and for the generations to come by preserving a quality environment. That is why today  more than ever  the time has come for us to join our hands and work to preserve our planet. To act against climate change is  in the last analysis  to preserve world peace and security and to ensure necessary conditions to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  which should be viewed and assumed as the minimum that can now be demanded. Indeed  let us not postpone until tomorrow what we can  and must  all do today  as tomorrow may be too late. "
"119",4869,"MRT",62,2007,"I am pleased to extend my warmest congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We have every confidence in your efforts to strengthen peace within a global system characterized by justice  balance and stability.  I would also like to congratulate your predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  on her successful efforts to advance debate and dialogue on the main concerns and problems of our day.  I also wish to congratulate and thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who  from the day he took office  began to promote the reform of the Organization  in addition to addressing international peace and security issues.  Allow me  in particular  to welcome the fact that the General Assembly at its sixty-first session focused on development issues  together with the fight against poverty  the adverse effects of climate change  economic globalization  promoting dialogue and understanding between civilizations and religions  introducing modern good governance systems  and the consolidation of democracy.  Achieving the Millennium Development Goals  which is an urgent priority  requires that we all intensify our efforts and promote cooperation and coordination so as to establish conditions conducive to sustainable  comprehensive and balanced development.  We believe that encouraging the spirit and values of understanding  dialogue and complementarity between civilizations and nations  upholding the rule of law  and expanding justice and equity are the speediest way to ensure peace and security in the world and eradicate hatred and confrontation between peoples. The continuation of seemingly intractable problems  the widening of the gap between rich and poor  the existence of structural dysfunctions in the global economy  the absence of justice  and the prevalence of injustice and despair are factors that perpetuate pockets of tension and conflict and encourage extremism and terrorism.  We in Mauritania have rejected terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We strongly condemn it and  at the same time  we continue to adhere to Islamic values in our society   which are based on tolerance and the rejection of violence and extremism and call for understanding and brotherhood.   Under the Charter of the United Nations we are committed to join efforts to maintain international peace and security. That commitment continues to be undermined by conflict situations  some of which have persisted since the founding of the Organization. The Arab-Israeli conflict is undeniably the one that generates the most antagonism and most threatens international peace and security. That conflict continues despite the fact that the framework setting out the general conditions for a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement of the conflict has been defined and reaffirmed over the years by the Security Council and the General Assembly. Those basic requirements constitute the very essence of the Arab Peace Initiative. That Initiative guarantees peace  security and the recognition of the State of Israel by Arab countries in exchange for an end to the occupation of Arab territories and an agreement to seek out mutually acceptable solutions for other outstanding issues. Israel must seize this historic opportunity and subsequently comply with international law so that the peoples of the region can at last live in peace   and in particular so that the Palestinian people can regain their usurped rights and be able to establish an independent State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.  Mauritania is of course following closely the issue of the Western Sahara. We are pleased with the recent steps that have led to the resumption of direct negotiations. We reiterate our support for the efforts of the Secretary-General to find a definitive solution acceptable to all parties that guarantees stability in the region.   With regard to Darfur  we are pleased about the agreement reached between the Government of the Sudan  the African Union and the United Nations. We hope that all parties will join efforts to ensure that peace  understanding and accord prevail as soon as possible among our Sudanese brothers and sisters.  As for the situation in Côte d’Ivoire  we were pleased to note the remarkable progress made on the path towards civic peace in the country. We hope that overall stability will prevail in that brotherly country and that it will once again assume its rightful place in the West African subregion and in the continent as a whole.  The African Union  working with the United Nations  is making intensive efforts to resolve the crises on the African continent. However  social and economic progress undoubtedly offers the best solution to those conflicts. Africa’s share of the world economy has declined in the past two decades. The continent now lags behind in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Yet  there are real signs of improvement in the situation on the continent. New economic opportunities now exist  thanks in large part to the growing demand for emerging markets  but Africa still needs further official development assistance and greater flows of foreign direct investment. I should like to point out that African countries are of course primarily responsible for their own development. They must also ensure the rule of law  promote good governance and establish a framework conducive to direct foreign investment.   This year  we in Mauritania improved the democratic process by establishing a pluralistic system based on a Constitution that guarantees the right of the peaceful transfer of power. Our country has therefore undergone a major democratic transformation. We have done so through presidential elections conducted in an atmosphere of transparency  honesty and open competition   as was noted by national and international observers  including the United Nations  the European Union  the League of Arab States  the African Union  the International Organization of la Francophonie and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. In the same atmosphere of freedom and pluralism  municipal and legislative elections made it possible to choose the representatives of the people to municipal councils and the two houses of Parliament. We paid particular attention to Mauritania’s women in both elections  with 20 per cent of contested seats reserved for them. As a result  women are now more represented than ever in the legislative and executive branches  as well as in local administration  diplomacy and management.   Moreover  my Government has made sustained efforts to strengthen national unity and to ensure transparency in the management of public affairs. Among other things  those efforts have led to steps to secure the dignified return of Mauritanian refugees residing in Senegal and Mali  so as to usher in a new era of brotherhood and national reconciliation in our country.   In the same vein  we have enacted a law criminalizing slavery. A high court of justice was also established in order  if necessary  to prosecute the president of the country and senior Government officials through an integral procedure that aims at institutionalizing the norms of good governance  modernizing institutions and strengthening the oversight mechanism through greater and direct participation by the representatives of the people and of civil society. We are more determined than ever to persevere along this path because we believe it is the best way to strengthen national unity and achieve development  security  stability and prosperity for the nation and for our citizens.   Mauritania is resolutely committed to contributing to relations of cooperation and solidarity in our region  in accordance with the ambitions and aspirations of our people. In this framework  our faith in the Arab Maghreb Union as a strategic choice for the region and our faith in the Arab League and the African Union are unwavering  given our firm commitment to the spirit of fraternity and solidarity and to relations of cooperation  friendship and good neighbourliness that link our country to its Arab and African environment. At the same time  our country remains determined to strengthen the bases of dialogue  exchange and understanding between peoples and civilizations  namely within the framework of the  Euro-Mediterranean dialogue.   Mauritania reiterates its commitment to the ideals and purposes of the United Nations  the only multilateral framework at the service of humanity as a whole. Faced with the multiple challenges and threats in today’s world  it is our common duty to make the United Nations a melting pot where we can harmonize our efforts to implement the priorities stated in the Millennium Declaration and at various international conferences. In a globalized world marked by the accumulation of wealth and an unprecedented acceleration of technological and scientific progress  it is up to us to benefit equitably from the possibilities that are offered to all peoples and to establish the best living conditions coupled with greater freedom. We took this commitment when we created the United Nations more than 60 years ago. Today we have the means to assume our responsibilities and to uphold this often reiterated commitment.  "
"120",4915,"MUS",62,2007,"May I  on behalf of my delegation  and in my own name  extend our sincere congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I assure him of our fullest support and cooperation in the daunting tasks that lie ahead of us. His election is a personal tribute to his engagement and rich experience in international politics and diplomacy. Allow me also to convey our sincere appreciation and thanks to his predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for the effective and efficient manner in which she conducted the business of the sixty-first session. May I also take this opportunity to pledge my delegation’s support to the new Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  in his efforts and approach in charting out a vision for the Organization that will respond to the needs and aspirations of the twenty-first century.  International peace and security constitute the bedrock of the Organization. We have come a long way since 1945 in securing peace and security in many parts of the world. However  a lot remains to be accomplished in order to have a conflict-free world. We are seriously concerned about what is happening in the Middle East. Conflicts in some parts of Africa continue to be a major source of concern to us. The trail of violence and death continues to plague the Middle East. In order to give peace a chance and allow it to take root in those regions and manifest its positive effects in the day-to-day lives of citizens  we need to redouble our efforts and explore all possible avenues to achieve peace  stability and security  in the larger interests of the citizens of those countries.  The fragility of the Middle East situation  and in particular the question of Palestine  needs a holistic approach that  inter alia  includes linkages embedded in the socio-cultural  political  economic and security issues of the region. I should also once again like to reiterate our full support for the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State side by side with the State of Israel.  With regard to Darfur  we welcome the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur which is expected to assume the peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations there. We call on all the parties concerned in the conflict to demonstrate their real commitment and resolve to engage fully in the search for lasting peace.  In Somalia  despite the serious efforts to contain violence during the past six months  the situation remains highly volatile. In that context  I would like to add my voice to the call made by the Chairperson of the African Union Commission  Mr. Konaré  to the Secretary-General to consider the possibility of deploying a United Nations force to assist the African Union Peace Support Mission in Somalia.  The President returned to the Chair.  The world today is confronted with growing threats of terrorism   be it home-grown  cross-border  regional or international in nature. That scourge should be confronted with all the means at the disposal of the international community. We also believe that more effective and efficient mechanisms should be put in place to capture the financiers of terrorist organizations.  The United Nations remains the cornerstone of the fight against terrorism. Mauritius has lent  and will continue to lend  its fullest support to the numerous initiatives and resolutions of the United Nations on counter-terrorism. We are happy to note that the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism entered into force in July of this year.  The world of the twenty-first century is a world of interdependence  with the national frontiers between peoples and countries falling faster than we had envisaged. This has brought about the interphase and interaction between peoples from different parts of the world. We are today living in a world intertwined with interreligious and intercultural predicaments.  Mauritius  as the Assembly is aware  is a multi-ethnic and multicultural society. Unity in diversity is the solid foundation on which we have built the framework for the peaceful coexistence of peoples of different faiths and cultures. Cultural diversity  understanding and respect for different faiths and religions are today part and parcel of Mauritian society.  We warmly welcome the convening of the High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace  which is to be held in October 2007 at United Nations Headquarters  for the promotion of tolerance  understanding and universal respect on matters of freedom and religion. We will certainly be part of the Dialogue.   Furthermore  we reaffirm our determination to support all initiatives that promote a culture of peace and tolerance. We are also happy to note that the General Assembly recently adopted resolution 61/271 to observe and celebrate the International Day of Non-Violence on 2 October each year in recognition of the great apostle of peace and non-violence  Mahatma Gandhi.  Mauritius is a strong advocate of all human rights and fundamental freedoms   so much so that the founding fathers of our constitution ensured that human rights figured prominently therein. Since our independence  in 1968  we have persistently endeavoured to place our citizens at the core of all forms of human rights and have ensured that they enjoy all political and civil rights irrespective of their status  colour or creed. We have enacted several pieces of legislation and we continue to enhance our legislative and institutional framework for the further protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We have set up the National Human Rights Commission  the Sex Discrimination Division  the Office of the Ombudsperson for Children and the Human Rights Centre to ensure and promote compliance with fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual and the international instruments on human rights.  Mauritius is party to all major international and regional human rights treaties. We continue to extend our unwavering support to the United Nations in the promotion and protection of human rights. As a member of the Human Rights Council  we are lending our fullest support to make it more effective  efficient and relevant in the eyes of the world. Our quest for universal respect for human rights demands that the perpetrators of massive violations be brought to justice promptly. Impunity gives rise to violations.   We cannot but admire the Buddhist monks of Myanmar and the courage of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi  whose party won a democratic and fair election in 1990  only to be removed from office by a military coup. She has now spent 11 of the last 17 years under house arrest. And now the legitimate stirrings of the people’s will are being brutally repressed in blood  as we are speaking here at the United Nations. It is our duty to let the people of Myanmar know that the free nations of the world stand by them. But we need to do more than just stand by them. The time has come for the most stringent sanctions to be taken against the military junta that has proved again and again that it is totally impervious to good sense and common humanity.  I am proud to say that in 1997  in my first term as Prime Minister  I took the decision to stop buying rice from Myanmar. I applaud the decision of the President of the United States of America to apply sanctions. All of us should do the same. The military junta must be sent a clear message: that the free world will not tolerate gunning down people who are demanding freedom and justice.  While the Assembly has made responding to climate change the thrust of the general debate  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has qualified climate change as the defining issue of our era. We cannot agree more with that. Climate change affects all of us. Indeed  if it is not addressed head on  it will have irreversible consequences and devastating effects on the survival of human beings and the habitability of our planet Earth. We all have a stake in addressing climate change and global warming.  We commend the laudable initiative of the Secretary-General in convening the High-level Event on Climate Change on 24 September. We remain confident that the strong message that has emanated from the High-level Event will provide the necessary impetus and political will and act as a catalyst to the Bali meeting later this year. However  in our approach to finding a global solution to climate change we should avoid making those who bear the least responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions and who are yet the hardest-hit  pay the price on the same scale as others who have led to the increase in global warming as early as the eighteenth century. Mauritius  for its part remains committed to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.  The rise in sea level constitutes a danger that threatens most of the low-lying island developing States. Those States have limited capacity to withstand the negative effects of natural disasters and external economic shocks. Their sustainable development becomes more trying and rigorous in the light of their inherent vulnerabilities. Mitigation and adaptation capabilities of countries may vary depending on the level of their economic development. Small island developing States (SIDS) face  in their adaptation choices  fundamental constraints of inadequate data and technical capacity  weak institutional capacity and limited financial resources.  In that respect we call for the full and effective implementation of the commitments  programmes and targets adopted in the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. A special SIDS fund to assist the development and implementation of adaptation measures in the same manner as the special fund for the least developed countries under the umbrella of the Global Environment Facility (GEF)  and regional climate observational systems to better monitor climate variations associated with global warming and sea-level rise  need to be set up.  While it is true that if the present pace of climate change goes unchecked  the face of the world may change dramatically in the next hundred years with devastating effects for future generations  it is equally true that underdevelopment  poverty  hunger and diseases such as HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis in the developing world are the present challenges that require the immediate and undivided attention of the world as laid down in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  The 2007 Millennium Development Goals midterm report underscores that “the MDGs will be attained only if concerted additional action is taken immediately and sustained until 2015” (Millennium Development Goals Report 2007  p. 4). Africa  unfortunately  in spite of serious and strenuous efforts  continues to lag far behind on the MDGs.  Mauritius for its part  is on track to meet the MDGs by the year 2015. Nonetheless  since my Government took office in 2005  we have allocated considerable resources in our national budget for the empowerment of the poor and the social uplifting of vulnerable groups. The development challenges of Mauritius go well beyond the achievement of the MDGs.  In order to improve the prospects for attaining the MDGs  it is essential for donors and development partners to honour their undertakings and commitments made at the 2002 Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development. In that respect  we hope that the follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development in 2008 will provide the much-awaited response from the concerned parties to adequately address international commitments on financing for development.  In our efforts to find ways and means to alleviate and ultimately eliminate poverty in our subregion  Mauritius  jointly with the Southern African Development Community will be hosting an International Conference on Poverty Alleviation and Development in April 2008.  While there is no denying the fact that globalization has led in its wake to economic growth in the world including developing countries  it is also true that many countries  especially the most vulnerable ones  are unfortunately not reaping the benefits of globalization. This is particularly true of LDCs  lower- and middle-income countries and countries in transition  which continue to face huge difficulties in integrating the globalizing economy.  We call for a new global strategy that would create an enabling economic environment for development. It would require greater coherence between the international trading  monetary and financial systems. We therefore reaffirm our dedication to the establishment of a new international economic order which emphasizes globalization with a human face whose benefits will be more widely shared.  More than six years after the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS “Global Crisis   Global Action”  the pandemic still remains a global crisis requiring global action. The negative impact of HIV/AIDS on human resources in the 25-45 age group  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa is simply overwhelming. The alarming rate with which the HIV/AIDS pandemic is ravaging innocent lives in our societies has far-reaching implications for our socio-economic development. It undermines the efforts towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Mauritius is merely 0.2 per cent  with between 20 and 30 per cent of the cases affecting vulnerable groups  such as prison inmates and intravenous drug users. Our policies are geared towards containing the level of contamination  in particular by combating transmission via the sharing of contaminated needles. We are providing substantial funds for the development of a needle exchange programme and a public awareness information and communication campaign on HIV/AIDS.  I wish here to put on record our appreciation to the Clinton Foundation for having included Mauritius amongst the countries that can benefit from the Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative.   Every year at this time heads of State and Government meet here in this Assembly  because we believe in the virtues of multilateral diplomacy. All of us here are sincerely concerned about the multiple tensions across the world. I am convinced that we all wish to make our full contribution to the search for practical  viable and long-term solutions. We are all inspired by the same will to manage our differences in dialogue and understanding. We want to call attention to the problems of globalization and participate in launching and strengthening the economies of our countries.  We recognize and welcome the enormous role that the United Nations plays on the international scene  a role that needs to be considerably enhanced. The scope of diplomacy has considerably widened in recent years. Through the lever of international relations  the United Nations has the means and the duty to promote cooperation based on conflict prevention and the efficient management of natural disasters. But the United Nations still needs improvement in its structure and functioning  and we hope that reform will soon be brought about.  We continue to follow with keen interest and participate actively in the ongoing reform process of the United Nations  particularly on the question of the reform of the Security Council  the revitalization of the General Assembly  system-wide coherence  the mandate review and the management reform.  For us  meaningful reform of the United Nations must first pass through a comprehensive reform of the United Nations Security Council. At the 2005 World Summit  we expressed our resolve to support early reform of the Security Council with a view to making it more broadly representative  efficient and transparent. There has been enough talk on this subject and it should not remain as mere words and intentions. My Government welcomes the decision of the Open-ended Working Group dealing with the reform of the Security Council  which has decided  inter alia  to start intergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the Security Council. We are convinced that the intergovernmental negotiations should be results-oriented.  Mauritius remains committed to the African common position  which calls for two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats for Africa in a reformed Security Council. We continue to support the legitimate aspirations of the Latin American and Caribbean countries for a permanent seat. Mauritius reiterates that a permanent seat for India in the Security Council is long overdue. As the largest democracy and a secular state  India is a living example of the peaceful coexistence of major religions  cultures and faiths. India can be a source of inspiration as well as a testing ground for the outcome of the forthcoming United Nations High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace.  In 1965 at the Constitutional Conference for the granting of independence to Mauritius  the Chagos Archipelago  among many other islands  formed an integral part of the territory of Mauritius and should have remained as such in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and General Assembly resolutions 1514 (1960) and 2066 (1965). Resolution 1514 (1960) states  inter alia: Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. (para. 6)  The excision of the Chagos Archipelago by the colonial Power at the time of our independence constitutes a dismemberment of our territory in total disregard of resolutions 1514 (1960) and 2066 (1965). Furthermore  it is also a violation of the Charter of the United Nations itself. We therefore  once again  reiterate our request to the United Kingdom to engage in bilateral dialogue with us as soon as possible with a view to enabling us exercise our sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago.  Equally  on the question of our sovereignty over Tromelin  we note the progress registered at the recent Mauritius-French joint commission. The United Kingdom and France  two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  are two major and important economic  trade and development partners of Mauritius. We fully appreciate their continued support in the development of our country. We have been striving to reach an amicable agreement on these issues but we cannot   and will not   compromise on our territorial integrity and our sovereignty over those islands.  To conclude  I should like to reaffirm my country’s full faith in the United Nations. It remains the only organization that offers us hope for peace and security for a better world for future generations. "
"121",4952,"MWI",62,2007,"I am happy to have this opportunity to address the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I convey my congratulations Mr. Kerim on his election as President of the Assembly at this session. The Malawi Government would like to assure him of our support in carrying out his duties as President.  I also take this opportunity to thank our hosts  President George W. Bush and the Government and the people of the United States of America  for the hospitality accorded to me and my delegation since our arrival in the state of New York.  I commend the previous President of the Assembly  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa  for the sterling leadership  direction and guidance she gave in steering the Assembly at its sixty-first session.  I wish to focus my address on Malawi’s efforts to meet the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Malawi believes that the MDGs are the tools for enhancing growth and development and for improving the livelihood of people in the poor countries of the world. I am pleased to state that my country is making steady progress in the implementation of the MDGs. We have adopted the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy as a home-grown overarching national policy for creating new wealth  for achieving sustainable economic growth and development and for combating the poverty that still engulfs many of our people.  The people of Malawi share a common vision to eliminate poverty in the shortest period possible by transforming the country from a predominantly importing and consuming to a predominantly manufacturing and exporting economy. That  we believe  will enable our country to position itself within the global economy and to compete favourably in the world markets.  To achieve that vision  we are implementing a sound system of economic governance in both the public and private sectors. That includes fighting corruption  reform of the public and private sectors  safeguarding human rights and the rule of law  increasing social protection for vulnerable groups  and developing infrastructure for development. My Government has also placed research  science and technology  including information and communications technology  gender empowerment and environmental protection  at the top of our development paradigm.  Based on the limitation of our resources  financial and human alike  we have identified six priorities within priorities that we believe can pull Malawi out of the poverty trap. Those include agricultural development and food security  irrigation and water development  transport and communications infrastructure development  energy and power  integrated rural development  and management and prevention of HIV and AIDS. I am pleased to report that the Malawi Government began to implement those priorities in 2004 and that  by 2006  we had achieved a phenomenal growth rate of 8.5 per cent. We therefore believe that the selection of these top priorities is a good one. We are also implementing an effective system of income distribution targeting the rural poor. I can therefore boldly say that the Malawi Government is confident that most of the Millennium Development Goals will be met or even surpassed by the year 2015.  I now wish to briefly review some of the Millennium Development Goals. For instance  we are certain to decrease by half the proportion of the population that suffers from extreme poverty and hunger  and to improve their nutritional status by the year 2015. Malawi has also made significant progress in the past three years in reducing poverty. In 1998  for instance  people living below the poverty line represented 53.9 per cent of the total population. That number was reduced to 45 per cent in 2006.   For the past two years  Malawi has achieved a high rate of agricultural production and food security. Presently  Malawi has a food surplus amounting to 1.4 million metric tons over and above our national food requirement. We are now able to export food to other countries in southern Africa.  Malawi has one of the highest budgetary allocations to agriculture and food security. We are empowering smallholder farmers to access essential farm inputs  mainly seeds and fertilizer  through a subsidy programme. We also support the development of viable small-  medium- and large-scale irrigation schemes to reduce dependence on rain-fed agriculture.  The other aspect of the MDGs that Malawi considers critical is the reduction in maternal and child mortality. Here again  my country has achieved remarkable progress  largely through the adoption of the Essential Health Package as the main strategy for the delivery of a cost-effective package of health services through a donor-funded sector-wide approach programme. We are also addressing the challenge to reduce the under-five mortality rate by two thirds by the year 2015 and to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters.  We have identified several highly preventable and treatable diseases  such as malaria  pneumonia  diarrhoea and malnutrition. Malawi is therefore on track towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals. We have reduced the rate of child deaths per 1 000 from 189 live births in 2000 to 133 in 2006.  In the fight against malaria  Malawi has so far distributed about 5 million insecticide-treated mosquito nets to various households. The percentage of pregnant women and children under five sleeping under treated nets increased from 8 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in 2006. In 2007  we plan to give out 3 million more mosquito nets with support from the Global Fund and President George Bush’s Malaria Initiative in that area.  One of Malawi’s biggest challenges is the management and prevention of tuberculosis  whose prevalence rate is very high  especially with regard to patients having HIV and AIDS. The Malawi Government has therefore declared tuberculosis to be an emergency and launched a five-year plan for addressing the problem.  I am pleased to state that Malawi is one of the few African countries that have been successful in meeting the challenges of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Malawi has also been successful in its public awareness campaign about the HIV/AIDS epidemic and its consequences. In 2004  Malawi had 14 voluntary counselling and testing centres  and those have now been increased to 250. Over 5 million people within Malawi have been tested within a period of less than three years. With the support of the Bill Clinton Foundation  Malawi now has over 130 000 people receiving free antiretroviral drugs. Additionally  in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and AIDS  we are now reaching over 60 per cent of pregnant women in Malawi. The General Assembly may wish to note that the Malawi national HIV and AIDS and antiretroviral therapy programmes are among the fastest growing in the world and that the pandemic is showing signs of a decline.  I wish to reiterate the statement I made to this Assembly in 2006 that we should regard HIV and AIDS not only as a medical crisis  but also as having economic  socio-cultural and political dimensions. That being the case  the solution to the crisis must be comprehensive and holistic. I have therefore established a Department of Nutrition  HIV and AIDS in my Office as a technical arm in implementing the Millennium Development Goals. I am also pleased to report that  from 2004 to date  Malawi has developed a national nutrition policy and accompanying documents as a guide for action. As a result  350 000 orphans are now getting nutrition support. That has reduced the negative impacts of malnutrition  HIV and AIDS  such as absenteeism  and many of those affected now return to work quickly and are reintegrated into the economy.  The Government of Malawi recognizes that water is life. We have therefore placed high priority on the development of our water resources. We are rehabilitating water-supply schemes and are constructing many earthen dams country-wide to allow rural communities access to clean water. Currently  about 66 per cent of the population has access to safe and clean water. Malawi is therefore confident that the MDG on access to water for all will be achieved before 2015.  In the area of universal primary education  the MDGs have set the target for universal primary education for both boys and girls. Malawi has a very high budget allocation for education  science and technology  in order to meet the relevant MDG. To date  60 per cent of Malawi’s children are enrolled in primary schools. We are also creating a conductive teaching and learning environment in order to reduce absenteeism  poor performance and drop-out rates.  Malawi is on the right path to achieving the Goal on the management of natural resources and environmental sustainability. We have reviewed our natural resources policies  legislation and programmes to curb the misuse and abuse of natural resources and to prevent environmental degradation. My Government is involving rural communities in the management of such existing resources as forestry  as well as in annual national tree planting for reforestation and the prevention of soil erosion and desertification. Furthermore  the Government is implementing management programmes for the sequestration of carbon  as well as other ecosystem services to encourage the extensive planting of trees.  In the area of gender equality the MDGs set out to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women by integrating targeted programmes for women to enable them to become part of economic growth. Malawi has a high level of female adult illiteracy  namely  48 per cent   as compared to 24 per cent for men. However  girls in Malawi also have a high drop-out rate from the formal schooling system  as well as high vulnerability to HIV and AIDS infection. We are addressing those problems.  My Government is also empowering women in the political  economic and social areas. In the past three years  there have been more women in ministerial and other management positions than ever before. The following key positions are now held by women: the posts of attorney-general  deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi  five full Cabinet ministers  one deputy minister  chairperson of the human rights commission  clerk of Parliament and several ambassadors  principal secretaries and chairpersons of statutory corporations.  I would like to conclude by stating that Malawi has successfully positioned itself to attain the MDGs. We are optimistic that many of those objectives will be attained. We therefore appeal to the United Nations to recognize Malawi’s heroic efforts and assist us to maintain the development momentum.   I would also like to appeal to our development partners to support Malawi’s policy to manufacture new goods and to provide new services to meet the MDGs. We need support to conduct our own research and to apply science and technology   including information and communication technology   to create new wealth  to build new capacity and to move Malawi from poverty to prosperity.

"122",4998,"MYS",62,2007,"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President on his election to preside over the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. Malaysia will work with him towards realizing the objectives of the Organization  particularly in efforts aimed at conferring more power on the General Assembly in managing the affairs of the United Nations. The course of human history is marked by a few pivotal moments during which we had an opportunity to make either the correct or the wrong decision  which had an impact on the destinies of those who come after. We are now living in such a time. There are certain problems that touch all our lives without exception. The change in climate and the increasing discord between cultures and civilizations are two such problems. The first problem is now globally affecting the well-being of planet Earth  while the second is threatening to tear apart the fabric of peaceful relations between peoples and nations. Let me first say something about climate change.  We are now fully aware of the gravity and the immediacy of the situation. Natural disasters and other extremes in the weather are occurring now  often in parts of the world that never before experienced such calamities. The worst is yet to come. Indeed  the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made it clear that the scale and urgency of the challenge is greater than we had thought or feared.  In December of this year  Indonesia will be hosting on Bali the thirteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We must agree to launch the process for negotiations on a post-2012 agreement. Ongoing national and regional initiatives to deal with climate change must not compete with  and should instead complement  the negotiations under the United Nations framework. Malaysia will fully support Indonesia in order to ensure that the Bali Conference achieves the success that it deserves.  We need to achieve consensus on certain fundamental issues  even before the negotiations begin for a post-2012 agreement. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must prevail. We must recognize the fact that the poorest countries of the world have the least capacity to adapt and should therefore be apportioned the least responsibility to mitigate the impacts of climate change.   A post-2012 agreement needs to build upon the architecture and other fundamentals of the Kyoto Protocol. For example  there should be absolute emission-reduction targets for developed countries  expanded mechanisms that facilitate contributions from developing countries and special provisions for the least developed countries and the small island developing States.   We know that climate change has implications not only for the environment but also for the global economy. That is an important additional reason why the principle of differentiated responsibilities must apply  so that developing countries can maintain their capacities for sustainable development. Of course  developing countries have their part to play in the management of climate change  but it must be commensurate with their abilities to perform.  On this subject  we must never forget the Earth Summit  held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992  where it all began. Caring for the environment and ensuring sustainable development were the themes of that global conference. The message of that Summit was that nothing less than a transformation of our attitude and behaviour will bring about the necessary changes. Those principles remain fully valid  and they should guide us as we begin the process of negotiations for the post-2012 agreement on climate change.  Let me now turn to the problem of the discord that is growing between Islam in general and the West as a whole. The main cause is the misperception in the West that Islam promotes exclusivity and encourages extremism. We must take action to generate greater understanding between the followers of different cultural and civilizational traditions. Malaysia fully supports the various efforts being made in that regard at the international level. We are confident that such dialogue will establish the truth that Islam is a religion that espouses universalism and not exclusivity  and tolerance rather than bigotry.  Malaysia is equally convinced that it is wrong to put the blame on religion as the cause of existing disputes between nations. All genuine religions advocate peace and harmony among peoples  as well as acceptance of others. That is certainly the case with Islam  which teaches its believers to practice tolerance  forgiveness  peace  fraternity and coexistence. The Koran  which is the foundation of the religion of Islam  is very explicit in recognizing the existence of religions other than Islam.  That religion is not the root cause of the world’s troubles  as has been confirmed by the report of the High-level Group for the Alliance of Civilizations that was released on 13 November 2006. The report maintains that  although religion is often cynically exploited to stir passions  fuel suspicions and support alarmist claims that the world is facing a new war of religions  the root of the matter is political  not religious. We should support various initiatives at the national and regional levels to promote the message and recommendations of the 2006 report.  Nevertheless  it is Malaysia’s view that such national and regional initiatives must finally culminate in a truly universal dialogue based on the multilateral intergovernmental process. It is only such a process that can establish binding commitments. Indeed  the success of such a dialogue has now become an important condition for securing the wider goals of global peace  security and prosperity.  There is a tendency to blame history  but there is no evidence in history that points to religion as the cause of the current discord between cultures and civilizations. Religion is not the explanation for the existence of conflicts between Western and Muslim countries. The answer lies in more recent times: the repeated use of force by the powerful over the weak to secure strategic or territorial gains. The vestiges of those wars for control and domination persist today as the gnawing problems in Afghanistan  Lebanon  the Golan Heights and Iraq.  With regard to Iraq  we cannot deny the fact that many of the problems now confronting the people of Iraq emanate from foreign occupation of that great country. Iraqis should be given a full opportunity to determine their own future. For that purpose  Iraq needs a government of national unity. That can be accomplished through national reconciliation.   I place great emphasis on national unity  because it has been our experience in Malaysia that national unity is best achieved through the practice of power-sharing in a government in which ethnic groups of different religious faiths are represented. Our Government has succeeded in bringing peace and prosperity to the country for the past 50 years of Malaysia’s independence. The international community has a clear responsibility to assist the people of Iraq to achieve peace and stability  so that the unity of Iraq as a nation is preserved  and the territorial integrity of Iraq as a State is not compromised.  With equal candour  I must also say that the problem of Palestine  which has been festering for 60 years without a solution being found  tops the list of grievances that the Islamic world holds against the West. We are all aware that there are fresh initiatives to bring Israel and Palestine  together with other States  to high-level peace talks in the very near future. Although I take the position that any final settlement of the issue of Palestine must necessarily take place within the framework of the United Nations  let us support the peace talks and hope that they create momentum for a true meeting of minds.   In particular  we should urge the Israeli and Palestinian leadership to act courageously so as to meet the needs and expectations of their peoples  who have suffered long enough. Of course  real peace can only be achieved if the legitimate rights of peoples are recognized and protected during the negotiations. Palestine has been partitioned before. That should never happen again.  All of us must play the role of honest brokers  assisting the parties through a difficult negotiating process on the path towards true peace. Both sides to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must commit to reaching solutions through compromise. This opportunity must be seized. The onus of delivery is on all of us.  I believe that the single most important issue in the way of peace and fraternity between Islamic and Western countries is the unsettled problem of Palestine. I am equally certain that once the problem of Palestine is settled  there will be greater harmony between Western and Islamic countries  the inheritors of the world’s two greatest religions and civilizations.  For their part  Muslims have a responsibility to present to the world the true face of Islam. It must be made clear that Islam is a religion that abhors conflicts  more so between Muslims. When disputes do arise  Islam enjoins forgiveness and reconciliation through mushawarah  which can be translated as engaging in dialogue and peaceful negotiation. Furthermore  the teachings of Islam put a very high premium on peace and development. Islam is definitely not an encumbrance to progress and prosperity. In my country  Malaysia  although Muslims constitute the large majority of the population  the Government has used the progressive teachings of Islam as the basis for good governance to deliver benefits to all sectors of our multi-ethnic and multireligious society without discrimination. We call this approach Islam Hadhari.  I have highlighted two major challenges that we now face in our time. I remain optimistic  however  that universal human fraternity and coexistence are attainable if  and when  critical political and strategic issues are resolved in tandem with the closing of the gap of misunderstandings between cultures and civilizations. That effort requires our collective wisdom and courage to recognize the problems. The well-being of planet Earth and all the people who inhabit it are actually within our control. We must have the will to moderate our excesses and cater for the needs of future generations  using science and technology as our tools. The time for us to invest in our collective future is here and now.  I would be remiss if   Malaysia being a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)   I ignored the situation in Myanmar. ASEAN has done everything possible to encourage Myanmar towards reconciliation and democracy. Their failure to do so has brought upon them the current situation. Let me express my country’s disapproval  along with that of other ASEAN countries  of the use of excessive force by the Government of Myanmar to put down justifiable civilian protests. Malaysia supports the efforts of the United Nations in sending Under-Secretary-General Ibrahim Gambari to Myanmar. We call upon the Government of Myanmar to give him its fullest cooperation to enable him to fulfil his mission on behalf of the international community. Let me also call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and for direct engagement between the leaders of Myanmar and various groups   in particular the National League for Democracy. "
"123",5025,"NAM",62,2007,"Sir  allow me to congratulate the President on his unanimous election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are confident that he will discharge the high responsibility of his office with the wisdom  skill and experience for which he is renowned.  I also wish to commend Ambassador Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  who acquitted herself very well in the management of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session.  I equally wish to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for taking up challenging issues facing humanity with courage and determination.  The world needs a stronger United Nations and effective multilateralism that can help humanity to respond in a timely and effective way to global challenges. Namibia regards climate change as one of the urgent challenges facing humanity today. There is an overwhelming body of scientific evidence that points to the urgency and gravity of climate change. Climate change is a global issue with serious implications for economic growth  sustainable development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  Climate change is a present-day reality that adversely affects the lives of many people. The international community has to live up to its commitment to provide resources to developing countries in order that they may adapt to the effects of climate change. By the same token  compulsory targets must be set for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  Namibia is not happy with the rate at which investments are being made in the development of renewable and clean energy sources. I call upon the private sector to join hands with Governments to develop and apply technologies that can mitigate climate change. Sir  I assure you of Namibia’s commitment to act in consort with other Member States to solve this problem through the establishment of concrete and ambitious goals to be implemented over an agreed period. All countries have a responsibility to act according to their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  Namibia would like to see the process for the reform of the United Nations expedited. The importance of a stronger and effective United Nations  capable of delivering its mandate  cannot be overemphasized. This  among other things  would involve the revitalization and reaffirmation of the authority of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative  policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations.  Namibia is pleased with the enhanced role of the Economic and Social Council. I believe that it is well positioned to shape the overall development agenda  to deal effectively with economic and social issues and to mobilize international efforts for the protection of the environment.  We believe that the Security Council should be made more democratic and transparent in its composition and working methods. All Member States  both big and small  should have a meaningful stake in it. Namibia appreciates the efforts of the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session to move the reform process forward. The Security Council has great significance for Africa  since a major part of its agenda currently concerns peace and security issues on that continent. In 2006  for example  42 out of a total of 87 resolutions adopted by the Security Council dealt with Africa. However  Africa has only three non-permanent seats on the Council.  I wish to reiterate Namibia’s strong support for the common African position as contained in the Ezulwini consensus and in the Sirte Declaration. The need for Africa to be equitably represented in the Council  with all the privileges associated with membership  remains a priority for us. The challenge in the immediate future would therefore be to begin a genuine intergovernmental negotiation process  based on the principle of justice and fairness for all.  The achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed commitments stand central to global economic stability and prosperity. The highest priority should be our collective commitment to sustainable socioeconomic development on a global scale. I therefore wish to express my delegation’s appreciation for the Millennium Development Goals Report 2007  which we find very useful as a summary of what has been achieved so far.  Namibia is concerned  however  that the results are slow and uneven. We wish to underline what is stated on page 4 of the report: “that the MDGs will be attained only if concerted additional action is taken immediately and sustained until 2015”. All stakeholders need to fulfil  in their entirety  the commitments they made in the Millennium Declaration and their subsequent pronouncements. It is  therefore  important that Governments and institutions in the economically advanced countries offer genuine partnership by providing new and additional resources commensurate with the commitments made in line with the MDGs.  Namibia is classified as a lower middle-income country. It ranks number 126 out of 177 countries on the Human Development Index  as it still bears the legacy of social and economic inequalities inherited from its colonial past. Inequality in the distribution of income and assets in Namibia is among the highest in the world. Nevertheless  Namibia has made progress in the provision of health  education and other critical services for the majority of the population  and we are on course to meet a number of the MDGs.  Indeed  we face severe difficulty in responding to a combination of the devastating HIV/AIDS pandemic  high levels of food insecurity and poverty at the household level. This situation is compounded by declining international aid to Namibia because of its classification as a lower middle-income country. I once again call upon the international community to increase its support to Namibia  including market access and access to financial sources  in the form of targeted official development assistance  concessional loans and investment flows.  Namibia applauds the Joint Communiqué agreed to by the United Nations Security Council and the African Union (AU) Peace and Security Council as a step in the right direction. There is a need for more structured and formalized cooperation between the two bodies on issues of peace and security in Africa. Such cooperation should also include the areas of financing  logistics  technology and training.  The right of peoples to self-determination is a fundamental human right that is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. It is sad that  seven years into the twenty-first century  colonialism is still with us  posing a serious challenge to this Organization and humanity at large. My delegation has raised its voice repeatedly in this Assembly by calling for the realization of the inalienable rights of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination. The international community has an obligation to assist the people of Western Sahara in their quest for freedom and independence. Namibia  therefore  calls for the immediate and unconditional implementation of the United Nations Settlement Plan for Western Sahara  and all resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly  with the aim of holding a free and fair referendum in Western Sahara.  Similarly  Namibia is deeply concerned about the continuous suffering of the people of Palestine under Israeli occupation. We wish to reaffirm our full and unequivocal support for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including their right to return to their land. I reiterate our appeal to the parties to resume the peace process on the basis of international law and all the relevant United Nations resolutions. To this end  the United Nations has a responsibility to assist the process.  My delegation reiterates its call for an unconditional end to the economic  commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America against Cuba. We believe that the blockade is not only against international law  but that it is also politically unjustifiable and undemocratic. Its extraterritorial nature impedes free trade and economic development. We urge the Government of the United States of America to heed the call of the international community and to implement the resolutions of the General Assembly that call for an end to the blockade.  Let us commit ourselves  once again  during this session of the General Assembly  to address effectively the challenges we face  to save humanity from catastrophe and to make the earth a common place for all  where all will live in peace and security. "
"124",5070,"NER",62,2007,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Kerim most warmly on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are convinced that his professional qualities and his vast and rich academic  diplomatic and business experience will lead to the success of our work. I therefore assure him of my delegation’s fullest support in the discharge of his mandate.  With respect to outgoing President Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  I wish to express our great satisfaction at her dynamic and skilful handling of the work of the previous session.  As to the Secretary-General  I take this opportunity to reiterate the Niger Government’s admiration and encouragement on his assumption of the leadership of our collective Organization.  Two years after the 2005 World Summit  which gave our leaders an opportunity to address the challenges and threats confronting humankind  we cannot help feeling optimistic   despite the persistence of such scourges as international terrorism or the slow progress towards fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals   as we consider the unflagging willingness of the international community resolutely to seek solutions consonant with the threats that have been identified.  In the field of international peace and security  one element of the significant developments in certain parts of the world is  without a doubt  the positive impact of the Peacebuilding Commission  in particular in Burundi and Sierra Leone. That alone makes the creation of that new body worthwhile. In Africa  such positive and encouraging trends can be witnessed in the hope raised by developments in certain conflict areas.   In West Africa  Liberia continues to move ahead with national reconstruction and consolidation of peace.   In Côte d’Ivoire  the peace process has shown great promise since the Ouagadougou agreement was signed in March 2007 and a “flame of peace” ceremony took place. Those two major events bear witness to the parties’ will to put a permanent end to the crisis that exploded in that country five years ago.   Sierra Leone  for the first time  and after a long period of instability  has organized free and transparent legislative and presidential elections  bearing witness to the resolve of the suffering people of that country to move beyond tragedy and to resolutely build a bright future.   In Central Africa  the adoption by the Great Lakes countries of the Pact on Security  Stability and Development leads us to expect  in the medium term  a meaningful improvement in the troubled situation that has prevailed there for some years now. It is encouraging to note that Burundi is already at the point where it can do without the international community’s supervision in peacekeeping efforts within its borders and to devote itself fully to the task of economic and social development.   The Democratic Republic of the Congo is another case in which we will allow ourselves to have great hopes if all the parties join in the peace movement and take part in the ongoing democratic process.   In Darfur  the situation remains worrisome to be sure  but thanks to the agreement between the Government of the Sudan and the United Nations and the adoption of Security Council resolution 1769 (2007) on 31 July  we hope that there will soon be a return to peace and security in that part of the Sudan.   In Western Sahara  we are gratified by the initiation of direct negotiations between Morocco and the POLISARIO Front  including the two meetings held under the aegis of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General subsequent to the adoption of Security Council resolution 1754 (2007).   Finally  with regard to Somalia  we earnestly hope that the national reconciliation conference and the efforts of the international community will yield positive results and enable that brother country to emerge forever from the crisis that has prevailed there for years.  The situation in the Middle East  dominated by the Israel-Palestine conflict  requires more focused attention by the international community. My delegation feels that the resumption of the political process remains the only way to move towards a just and lasting solution  on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the principle of two viable States living side by side in peace and security. The Quartet Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative remain frames of reference in this regard.   Generally speaking  the coherent subregional approach employed by the United Nations and the subregional organizations seems well suited to handling conflicts  and also to responding to other concerns  such as international migration  trafficking in human beings  trafficking in drugs  transnational crime and the proliferation and spread of small arms and light weapons. From this perspective  in particular as regards the African continent  the capacity of subregional organizations and the African Union should be reinforced.   The United Nations Ten-year Capacity-Building Programme for the African Union is to be commended  as it opens new possibilities for conflict prevention and the maintenance of lasting peace on the continent  in particular through the creation of an African intervention force. Along these lines  the open debates of the Security Council on strengthening the role of the Council in conflict prevention and resolution  in particular in Africa  are of great importance.   Conflicts are not the only threats to international peace and security. Other phenomena  sometimes more devastating and unforeseeable  threaten the ability of peoples around the world to enjoy their legitimate right to peace and security. Those phenomena include international terrorism  transnational crime and all types of trafficking.   In this connection  the Sahara  a geographical zone that the Niger shares with several other African countries  is becoming a den of drug and arms traffickers  fuelling and perpetuating insecurity in the region. The Niger intends to participate intensively in any effort to enhance the international community’s efforts to eradicate that scourge  which undermines the economies of the countries concerned and threatens the foundations of democracy.   In that regard  my delegation considers international cooperation and assistance for affected developing countries to be indispensable if we are to succeed in combating drug trafficking and trafficking in small arms and light weapons  including anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. These are used by armed groups to continue to inflict untold suffering on innocent civilians  obstruct trade and hinder all development activities in infested areas. The scope and gravity of the phenomenon truly require that the international community give it all due attention and firmly condemn the criminal acts being carried out by these networks of traffickers  in particular in our region.  The linkage between peace  security  development and human rights  spelled out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1)  has lost none of its relevance and continues to fuel our thinking. That is why the Niger continues to feel a sense of solidarity for all initiatives  present or future  designed to give new momentum to development efforts.   Niger welcomes the initiative of the informal thematic debate entitled “Partnerships towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals: Taking stock  moving forward”  held on 27 November 2006 and the first in a series of three debates organized by the General Assembly in the context of its revitalization process. On that occasion  some development partners were able to undertake concrete commitments  such as that of the Islamic Development Bank  which announced the creation of a poverty mitigation fund endowed with a $10 billion budget. The Government of the Niger  through me  would like to commend that exemplary initiative  which is part of an ever more effective development partnership.   The Niger sees the General Assembly’s adoption of resolution of 61/16 on strengthening the role of the Economic and Social Council as a great step forward. The resolution names the Economic and Social Council as a principal body responsible for economic and social development and  in particular  for the implementation of the international development goals agreed at the major United Nations conferences and summits  including the Millennium Development Goals.   We congratulate the State of Qatar on having hosted the preparatory meeting for the Monterrey Consensus review conference  to be held in Doha in 2008. Moreover  the unparalleled commitment of the Government of Qatar to international development led it to host the Conference on Consolidating Food Security in Niger  which was held in Doha with the support of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and proved most successful. I therefore take this privileged moment at the rostrum of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session to reiterate the profound gratitude of the people and Government of the Niger to that friendly country  the entire Islamic ummah and all other partners who kindly supported that initiative.  The international community should pay particular attention to one category of countries that is even more vulnerable. I am referring to land-locked developing countries  whose geography puts them at a great disadvantage. In 2003  the Almaty Conference  having considered their situation  adopted a Declaration and Programme of Action  the implementation of which is soon to be reviewed. The time has therefore come to launch an urgent appeal to all development partners to resolve to take the necessary measures not only to help those countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  but also to enable them to mitigate the negative impacts of desertification  environmental degradation and climate change.   Desertification and the deteriorating environment are two problems that seriously affect the countries of the Sahel  including mine. The combined efforts of the international community effectively to combat those scourges should be stepped up. The action taken by the Niger  based on the experience gained through the special programme launched by the President of the Republic  has allowed us to achieve spectacular successes that deserve to be consolidated and strengthened.  Thanks to the work to restore degraded soil  remove sand and reforest the landscape undertaken over the past few years and stepped up in the framework of that programme  3 million hectares have been reclaimed from the desert  according to satellite monitoring undertaken in 2006 and transmitted by the regional Agrimet centre. Large expanses that were desperately arid have now become productive  agricultural areas and pasture land thanks to water-retention and infiltration activities that have raised the water table. It is worth noting that such activities are being carried out by several thousand young people being paid through a cash-for-work programme.   The public debate in the Security Council and the thematic debate in the General Assembly dedicated to climate change highlighted the scope and gravity of the phenomenon by emphasizing the need for urgent collective action. The eloquent statements made at the high-level meeting organized by the Secretary-General on 24 September lead us to believe that the parties are willing to move to achieve essential objectives  which is the only way to secure a wholesome and reliable environment for present and future generations. The Niger resolutely supports that momentum and  within its national strategy and plan of action for climate change and viability  has drafted a national programme of action for adaptation to climate change.  All such questions  which fall within the context of a comprehensive vision of sustainable development  are covered in our revised poverty reduction strategy  which is the reference framework for my country’s overall economic and development policy. I take this exceptional opportunity solemnly to invite all our development partners to participate in the international conference on the Niger’s revised poverty reduction strategy  to be held in Brussels in October. The conference has been called  inter alia  to harmonize and coordinate the contributions of our development partners.  Harmonization and coordination are topical issues in the United Nations. They are essential to increasing the Organization’s effectiveness in collective action to address global challenges and threats. My delegation agrees that system-wide coherence in United Nations activities should be a principal focus for the implementation of reforms advocated in the Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit. We must therefore find the means to implement them. I note that we see such reforms as a way of better helping developing countries to achieve lasting economic growth  develop sustainably and eradicate poverty.   That is the vision that leads me to reaffirm the Niger’s conviction that coherence and coordination must be inspired by the cardinal principles of ownership  national leadership and respect for national development priorities.

Since coming into office  my Administration has anchored its pursuit of a re-energized  stable and prosperous Nigeria on the fundamental principles of democracy  good governance  free enterprise and the rule of law. Those are worthy principles which Nigeria shares with the United Nations family.   As a main theme of this session's general debate  ""Responding to climate change"" is most appropriate. the African continent is particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. In our collective determination to meet this challenge  African leaders at the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union (AU)  which met in Addis Ababa last January  decided to integrate climate change issues into all sustainable development initiatives at the national and regional levels.   Nigeria reiterates its commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. While applauding the successful outcome of the high-level event on climate change that was held here two days ago  on 24 September  we affirm that much more needs to be done.   It has been seven years since world leaders met in this Hall for the Millennium Assembly and committed themselves to ridding Africa of its most pressing socioeconomic and political challenges in order to allow the continent move with the rest of the world. While tangible progress has been made in a few areas  the continent is still bedevilled by great challenges.   The continued festering of the Darfur crisis remains a blight on the collective conscience of the international community  one which the Assembly needs to address with the utmost urgency. The humanitarian crisis has reached a critical level. The Abuja Peace Agreement  which Nigeria helped to facilitate  remains the reference point for a comprehensive settlement of the crisis. However  the lack of full implementation of the Agreement raises serious cause for concern  and we call on all parties to respect their commitments and help drive the peace process forward. We continue to support the process and reaffirm our support for the African Union â€” United Nations hybrid force in the Sudan.   It is imperative that the concerted fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic  malaria  tuberculosis and related diseases not lose momentum. At the national level  we in Nigeria have consistently taken concrete measures to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and to increase funding for the National Action Committee on AIDS. We appreciate the financial and material assistance from our development partners in this regard  but our continent cries out for even more intensified collective efforts at ridding Africa of this and other pandemics.   Two years ago  we appraised our performance against the set targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and realized that unless concrete and more determined actions were taken  the overarching aim of meeting the 2015 targets of poverty eradication would remain a fantasy. We recognize that the primary responsibility for social and economic development rests mostly with individual States. Within the ambit of the African Union's New Partnership for Africa's Development  the nations of Africa are practically facing up to the continent's economic and sociopolitical development challenges through the adoption and engendering of a new political culture that will be conducive to long-term development.   Through such initiatives as the African Union's African Peer Review Mechanism  our programme of self-monitoring and self-assessment  as well as the institutionalization of the ideals of democracy and good governance  Africa has clearly defined an assured course to economic regeneration and political stability. What Africa seeks from the international community is genuine partnership for economic development. This should be manifested in a global economic system predicated on fairness  justice and equity  one that ensures fair trade terms and recognizes the centrality of mutuality in prosperity. More specifically  Africa requires massive and focused foreign investment in the development of critical infrastructure across the continent.  Let me say that we in Nigeria are wholly committed to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) in the fight against international terrorism. As a follow-up to that commitment  Nigeria has established four counter-terrorism centres in the country  in addition to the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit  which  together with the Central Bank of Nigeria  monitors banking transactions as part of the mechanism to locate and terminate the illegal transfer of funds for terrorist and other criminal acts  including money laundering. Nigeria reiterates its condemnation of all acts of terrorism and calls upon the international community to muster the political will necessary to confront and check this menace.  Nigeria affirms its abiding faith in the ideals and objectives of the United Nations. We believe that a strengthened and restructured United Nations would be best placed to address the complex challenges facing our world today. In that regard  my delegation will continue to collaborate with other Member States to press for comprehensive reform of the United Nations system  including the much-desired expansion of the Security Council in both the permanent and non-permanent categories in order to reflect the realities of todayâ€™s world. The situation whereby Africa is totally excluded from permanent membership of the Council is unfair and untenable and must be rectified.  The challenges that confront our world today call for renewed purpose  renewed resolve  renewed courage and renewed respect for human dignity. Posterity beckons us to a real test of our sense of duty. We cannot afford to fail that test. I assure the Assembly that Nigeria will continue to support the United Nations in our collective aspirations for a safer  fairer  more just and more prosperous world. "
"126",5161,"NIC",62,2007,"I should like to begin by remembering the millions of human beings who are the victims of the policies of colonialism and neo-colonialism. Let us remember the victims of the Holocaust. Let us remember the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Let us remember the victims of slavery and apartheid. Let us remember the victims of the wars of occupation of Viet Nam and Afghanistan  the Dominican Republic  Grenada  Panama and Nicaragua. Let us remember the heroic and noble Cuban people  who have suffered all kinds of aggression and a brutal and inhumane blockade. Let us remember the five heroes who are prisoners of the empire because they were fighting terrorism. Let us remember the victims of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre and the millions and millions of men and women who have been and continue to be victims of the genocide caused by global capitalism. Let us remember the victims of discrimination and apartheid at the hands of those who refuse to admit into the developed countries  peoples who  in Latin America  are attempting to come into the United States  and people in Africa and Asia who are trying to go to the European nations. Our thoughts  our appreciation and our solidarity go to the victims of natural disasters  who are at the same time victims of global imperialist capitalism  which  through its development-oriented policy continues to bring destruction  death and poverty  becoming the greatest aggressor of mother Earth  now destroyed by the avarice of imperialist capitalism.  Let us remember the recent victims of natural occurrences triggered by these spoliations resulting from imperialist global capitalism: the victims of Hurricane Katrina  the victims of the earthquake in Peru  the victims of the floods in Africa  the victims among the indigenous peoples   the Miskito and Mayan peoples   of Hurricane Felix  in Central America  Latin America and the Caribbean and the land of Sandino and Rubén Darío. Our brothers and sisters in the Miskito and Mayan peoples who achieved autonomy in 1987 and who  today  are part of a process whereby their full rights will be recognized  under the Autonomy Act  have asked me to express their appreciation to the United Nations because that battle has been going on for more than 20 years and now we are beginning to recognize the rights of indigenous peoples. They have asked me to circulate here  in the United Nations  a document signed by our brothers  the leaders of the Miskito and Mayan peoples  Afrodescendant peoples  victims of Hurricane Felix  so that it may be seen by you all  our brothers and sisters who represent the peoples of the world.  In the period from 1979 to 1989  I had the opportunity to speak before the United Nations General Assembly  and I remember well the speeches and messages and positions from that time. Eighteen years have gone by  and thanks to the unending struggle of the Sandinist people  I am here again today to address these words to the Assembly. This morning  when this general debate began  I listened carefully to the words of the second speaker  who spoke for exactly 20 minutes   and I myself hope not to exceed 20 minutes   and I cannot find any difference between the thoughts  words and actions of those who  at the time  were at the helm of that imperialist power  and the speech that I heard this morning.  The presidents of the United States change  and they may come to office with the best intentions and may feel that they are doing good for humanity. But they fail to understand that they are no more than the instruments of yet another empire among the many empires that have imposed themselves on our planet  and they forget that the life of empires is ephemeral. They rise  they grow arrogant and mighty and then begin to dictate as if they were gods   telling people what is good and bad  determining how they provide what they call assistance   which is no more than paying back the historical debt they owe to our peoples. What they are doing is simply responding to empire  to the politics of Empire and for that reason we should not be surprised that not only are we hearing the same speeches all over again  but also that we are seeing the same conditions of oppression and violence and terror being suffered by humanity. And today  we are more threatened than we were 18 years ago when I last had the opportunity to speak before the United Nations.  Today  under the tyranny of global imperialist capitalism  there is an international economic order  of course there is  but who dictates that international economic order? It is dictated by a minority of dictators who impose their interests  the same old interests. They are the ones who enslaved Africans and enslaved and oppressed our indigenous forefathers. They are the ones who wiped out the original peoples of the United States. Then immigrants from Europe came over here and unperturbedly   by what right?   began to mix with those people  and to become in turn  owners of what did not belong to them. They robbed the original peoples of their rights and their cultures and imposed their culture and the interests of the colonizers. That is what gave rise to what we call today the most exemplary democracy in the world  when really  it is a tyranny   the biggest  most overwhelming dictatorship that has ever existed throughout the history of humanity.  I am referring to the tyranny of the United States empire. If anyone has doubts  let us see how its President spoke to us this morning. He spoke of Cuba with a complete lack of respect while representing a system that ordered the assassination of its President  our dear brother Fidel Castro  whom we had for his extraordinary solidarity  firmness and principled consistency in his struggle for the cause of humankind. They have maintained a brutal blockade against Cuba  while for interests of State  they set aside their so-called democratic principles when  for economic reasons  they act together with other nations with which they supposedly have ideological differences: capital unites them and ideological differences disappear.   On what authority and by what right does he question the right of the peoples of Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to nuclear development for peaceful purposes? And even if they wanted to use nuclear power for military purposes  on whose authority and by what right does the only State in history to have dropped atomic bombs on innocent people  as it did on Hiroshima and Nagasaki  condemn the people of Iran  who are working to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes? They have decided that this is not for peaceful purposes  but who gave them that right? They gave it to themselves  and they are imposing that on the General Assembly  and the Assembly is simply a reflection of the realities of a world where a capitalist and imperialist minority is imposing global capitalism and establishing an order to exploit  repress  impoverish  enslave and impose apartheid against Latin American migrants and against African migrants in Europe. Global capitalism has only one head  but it has tentacles everywhere.   On what authority can the country that possesses the greatest nuclear arsenal in the world  or any other country possessing nuclear weapons  come here and seek to question the rights of other countries to the peaceful development of nuclear energy? What moral authority do they have to question the right of any people to develop nuclear energy for peaceful or even for military purposes?   Objectively  this is not the best path for humankind. The best path for humankind is for nuclear weapons to disappear altogether. If the United States  its people and its Presidents   and I do not want to single out any individual President or leader of an empire; an empire is an empire  and it does not matter who is heading the empire  whether they call themselves Democrat or Republican   really want to demonstrate their commitment to putting an end to the threat of nuclear energy being used for military purposes  then they have to be the first to move towards a policy of nuclear disarmament  a policy that should encompass all those that possess nuclear weapons. Then they would have the moral authority to say that no people in the world should devote resources to developing nuclear technology for military purposes. Then  all nations would have the possibility and the right to opt for nuclear energy for peaceful purposes   an option that they would seek to deny to developing peoples.  Eighteen years ago  from this very rostrum  I spoke of the Palestinian issue. The Palestinian people endure an ongoing bloody conflict with a country that possesses nuclear weapons and that is entrenched in the historic territory of the Palestinian people.   Eighteen years ago we spoke of the people of Puerto Rico  a nation which is still fighting for its independence. The United States continues unambiguously to pursue its neo-colonial policies  combining the most advanced and modern forms of domination with the most retrograde forms of domination  such as its military base in Guantánamo.   Eighteen years ago we spoke of armament  and nothing has changed. Eighteen years ago we spoke of war  and today things look much worse because of the brutal war imposed by the empire and by its economic and oil interests. They thought it would be easy to occupy Iraq and Afghanistan  but they have met with resistance from those peoples. It was an invasion launched on the basis of a campaign of lies: it was uncertain that Iraq was in a position to produce nuclear weapons.   So what can I conclude? I can conclude that the enemy is still the same after these 18 years: here I am again in the United Nations  and the enemy is still the same.  The enemy is called global imperialist capitalism and it is only we  the people  who can change things. Peoples that have attained liberation were not given it by those that enslaved them  but rather thanks to their own struggle and the blood they shed  for example in South Africa’s independence struggle. How many years of disgrace  suffering  slavery and apartheid did they endure in South Africa? That story is true for the whole of the African continent. Those peoples achieved their freedom despite modern colonialists consistently trying to sustain these forms of occupation. To be sure  they have adopted new forms of occupation and domination.  The liberation of our peoples is not guaranteed. Our peoples must continue to give battle. The unity of our peoples is the key: the unity of the Latin American peoples  the Central American peoples and the Caribbean peoples under the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). They are trying to repeat the kind of action taken against Venezuela  when a democratically elected president was faced with a military coup. They are trying to repeat the history of Salvador Allende  the history of Chile. But the United Nations was not convened to say what barbarity had taken place. Yet what had happened in Venezuela needed to be condemned  because the Government had been democratically elected. But no: in fact  the imperialist Power moved immediately to recognize the leaders of the coup. It was the Venezuelan people who rose up to return the elected President to his place. Thus  it is the people who decide their own fate.   Hence  we can all be full of the best intentions about changing the United Nations. I do not doubt that even representatives of countries that espouse global capitalism and imperialism come here with the best of intentions   some of them. But they lose sight of the fact that they are continuing their handout proposals and approaches   for these are indeed handouts. When they talk about aid  they are insulting us. They have to understand that once and for all. They have profited from the privatization carried out in developing countries by the huge multinational corporations. They say that they come to help us. What businessman comes to help? When a businessman invests  he invests in order to make the biggest profit he can: not to invest in the country  but rather to take away  because we developing countries are considered to be insecure. In short  we are the victims of a ransacking.  Compare the volume of the wealth that the capitalist and developed countries are currently extracting from our countries  the developing countries  through their big companies and multinational corporations with what Latin American immigrants send back to their families from the United States or what Asian and African immigrants in Europe send back to their families: the latter really is a miserable amount compared to the volume of wealth that is being plundered on a daily basis by these institutionalized forms of oppression.   However  immigrants working in the United States or in Europe work harder than anyone else. They are doing jobs that neither Europeans nor Americans want to do  and for miserable wages. So who is doing whom a favour? Indeed  nobody is doing any favours for the Latin Americans who find work in the United States and who manage to put aside a bit of money so they can send $100 or $200 back to their families  compared to the plundering by big businesses  which go to developing countries not only to reap enormous profits  but also to take advantage of cheap labour and the conditionalities imposed by free trade agreements. Human beings  societies and nations are all clashing with free trade  and it remains to be seen who is the strongest. Logically  it will be the strongest who prevail. Free trade is the law of the jungle.  What the world needs is fair trade. What the world demands is genuine change in the capitalist  globalized  imperialist countries. They have to change their concept of a free market; they have to exchange the concept of free trade for that of fair trade and a fair international market. Solving this problem is not a question of reducing subsidies because plainly the disparities are so enormous that that is impossible. This problem will never be resolved piecemeal but through profoundly radical change leading to the democratization of the minority on planet Earth who own the wealth  own the nuclear weapons  impose their policies on the Assembly and go over the heads of the Security Council. They impose their own laws  which are now solidly entrenched  and they have no respect for humanity. It is only by changing the policy within those peoples  within those nations  within those Governments that we can really obtain the fair world that we are all talking about. For we all talk about a just world. We all talk about a peaceful world. We all talk about a world of brotherly love and solidarity. But there is a wide gap between words and deeds.  Dear brothers and sisters  please accept the greetings of the people of Nicaragua  a fighting people  a people that has suffered interference from the empire since 1856   before the triumph of the October Revolution  the great Lenin revolution. Before the East-West conflict had begun  Nicaragua was already suffering from the expansionist policies of empire; already we had to take arms to defend ourselves against those who wanted to trample upon us and impose Yankee presidents.   Dear brothers and sisters  we ask you to pass on to your peoples our belief   our certainty   that today  more than ever  there exist conditions for unity among the Latin American and Caribbean peoples. We are seeing growing unity among the African peoples. The unity of the Asian peoples must grow as well  but free from global capitalism. What good is speaking about socialism if what we are actually building is capitalism and if we are just creating a holy alliance with global capitalism and imperialism? We have to build this great unity in Africa  in Asia   and in Latin America  where we are marching with the same strength  the same vigour and the same living principles that were those of the African fighters like Lumumba and Sekou Touré; the principles of the Latin American fighters; the principles of the North American fighters  the United States fighters; the principles of the European fighters; the principles of the Latin America of Bolívar  of Martí  of Sandino  of Tupac Katari  of Tupac Amaru. Those principles still live and will live as long as these forms of oppression persist.  I have faith in God and the certainty that  just as peoples  despite so much oppression and destruction  have not surrendered or sold out  today  more than ever before  peoples should rise up with pride and firmness and dignity. They are not going to sell out and they are not going to surrender to the global capitalist empire. "
"127",5208,"NLD",62,2007,"I would like to  begin by congratulating Mr. Kerim on his election as President of the General Assembly. I would also like to wish our Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  every success at his first full session of the General Assembly since taking office. He has been very active in his first nine months. The Netherlands fully supports his efforts to promote peace and development in the world and to make the United Nations more effective.  I am convinced that the success or failure of the United Nations depends on three fundamental factors. The first is how much inspiration we draw from our common values: respect for human rights  for the rule of law and for our planet. The second is how much we shoulder our responsibility as members of the international community. And the third is how successful we are in making the United Nations more relevant and in increasing the impact of the international community. I will deal with each of these three themes in turn   respect  responsibility and relevance.  Next year it will be 60 years since the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (resolution 217 A (III)). The values contained in that Declaration and in the conventions based on it are our source of inspiration. In its preamble  the Declaration sets out our mission: “the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want”. For the past 60 years  those values have been our moral compass  our common standard of achievement. Whatever our differences of opinion  we must never lose sight of that common ideal. We all agree that every human being deserves a chance to build a good life. Respect for human rights and the rule of law is our deepest motive and our highest aspiration. Our diversity rests on that unity. We should not hesitate to hold one another to account.   As we speak  the situation in one country in particular calls for urgent action by the international community. In Burma  the military are shooting at monks and civilians  who are demonstrating peacefully. We strongly condemn that brutal use of force. Together with the European Union and the United States  we call on the Security Council to discuss the situation urgently and to consider further steps  including sanctions. Should the Security Council not reach agreement  we will shoulder our responsibility. In that case  I am convinced the European Union and the United States will decide on further measures  together with other well-intentioned countries.  When it comes to human rights and the rule of law  I am not talking about abstractions. Every child that can go to school  every family that can live in peace and freedom with its neighbours and every country that enjoys prosperity and tolerance is a step towards fulfilling our dream.  Values connect us across our cultures and religions. We must not allow cultural or religious differences to create barriers to open dialogue. Asma Jahangir  the United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief  tells us that religious freedom is under threat in many parts of the world. So  we have a lot to do.  The Netherlands wants to join forces with all those who want to promote tolerance and dialogue between civilizations. But we must not allow that dialogue to put the universal validity of our common values in question. We know from experience how fundamental our shared values are. The Netherlands is one country in the world. But in a sense  we are also the world in one country. Our capital  Amsterdam  is home to 177 nationalities. We have learned that only through unity in diversity can we make progress  locally  nationally and internationally. That means that the rule of law must be strictly enforced so that people can feel safe. It also means that we need to be more tolerant and willing to take a critical look at ourselves. Stressing our differences leads to polarization and solves nothing.   We owe respect not only to one another  but also to our planet. It gives us everything we need  provided that we treat its natural resources wisely and do not upset its natural balance. That is why sustainability is one of our most important values. A value is not something that we possess. It is not an achievement that we can boast about. A value is a task  an incentive to action. Cherishing values automatically means accepting responsibility.  Membership of the United Nations goes hand in hand with moral responsibility. It means more than attending meetings and even paying our dues. It also means keeping our commitments. The treaties we sign must not remain a dead letter. Human rights must be respected. The Netherlands is proud to contribute  for example as a member and a Vice-President of the Human Rights Council.  In 2005 the United Nations adopted the principle of the responsibility to protect. In doing so  we sided with all those suffering from genocide or crimes against humanity. It is now time to put that principle into practice. The United Nations has a key responsibility as a protector of peace and security. Each of us shares that responsibility. In this age of rapid communications and global linkage  nothing is far away anymore. What happens elsewhere affects us all.  We can only secure lasting peace in areas of conflict if we combine defence with development and diplomacy. We are putting that concept into practice in the Afghan province of Uruzgan  together with our Australian partners and other allies. It is a difficult and demanding mission under United Nations mandate. The international community must not abandon Afghanistan to its fate. The hopes of millions of Afghans rest with us. The United Nations needs to broaden and intensify its role in Afghanistan.   The Peacebuilding Commission has a vital role to play in bridging the gap between conflict and development. In the past year  it has worked hard to help several African countries that are on the difficult road of reconstruction after being torn apart by conflict. The Netherlands is actively supporting that very promising approach  which focuses on prevention.  Assembly President Kerim has drawn attention to another responsibility we all share: the need for prompt action to tackle the problem of climate change. The industrialized countries   and that means all of them   should take the lead. But the countries that are now enjoying rapid economic growth are also being asked to develop more sustainably. The future lies with those countries that excel in energy conservation and the use of cleaner technologies. We are not yet making sufficient use of the scope that innovation offers us.   The Netherlands wants to be a front-runner  not only in our ambition to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions  but also in developing new strategies to deal with the negative effects of climate change. It is important to take climate and nature into account in all our investments. The most vulnerable developing countries deserve more support in tackling the problems they face.  In December  at the Bali Climate Change Conference  the United Nations has a unique opportunity to take charge of the situation and create a united global framework for addressing the climate problem. European government leaders would like to see negotiations start in Bali on a follow-up to Kyoto. The Netherlands and its European partners will do all they can to accomplish that.  Responsibility also means ongoing efforts to make the United Nations more relevant. The United Nations is the platform for seeking global solutions to global problems. The world needs an effective United Nations. How can we be more effective  efficient and credible? We need to strengthen the rule of law and put an end to impunity. We are not yet making full use of the instruments we have. I say this as Prime Minister of a country that is proud to have the legal capital of the world   The Hague   within its borders. Without justice  there can be no lasting peace and no reconciliation. We would like to see the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court accepted more widely. We stress the need for cooperation by both member and non-member States with the International Criminal Court in general and with regard to the execution of arrest warrants in particular.  The Netherlands will continue to make a special effort to promote the international legal order. That is why we have responded positively to the Secretary-General’s request to host the Lebanon tribunal in the Netherlands. Preparations for that tribunal are in full swing.   Enforcing the rule of law is not enough to make the United Nations more relevant. We also need to keep a critical eye on how we work. Let us resist the temptation to invest too much energy in resolutions we adopt every year. It is better to invest in strengthening confidence between North and South  West and East. People and resources are scarce. We can only spend each euro once. If we want to achieve our common aims  such as the Millennium Development Goals  we need to coordinate our efforts.  Several dozen United Nations agencies are active around the world. We have planted a forest of United Nations flags in various countries. We need a more unified approach in order to help the poorest developing countries more. We can work far more efficiently if we pool our resources in a single programme in each country. That makes demands on donors. Several countries  including the Netherlands  now fund various United Nations organizations on the basis of multi-year plans. I hope that others will follow suit.  The Netherlands supports the Secretary-General’s efforts to reform the United Nations system and the Security Council. Reforms are never easy  but they are essential. In a world that is changing at breakneck speed  we need multilateral institutions that can respond to new developments. A relevant United Nations means a dynamic United Nations with dynamic institutions.  Reforms are sometimes seen as giving up certainties. I am convinced that we need to reform in order to safeguard what we all hold dear: respect for human rights  enforcement of the rule of law and sustainable development for all nations. Those values are the lifeblood of the United Nations. Respect for our values means taking joint responsibility. Responsibility means a constant effort to make the United Nations more relevant. We want our values to take concrete form in the twenty-first century in people’s lives and in international relations. That demands unity of purpose  courage and resolution from us all. Above all  it requires ambition  the ambition to make a determined effort   while respecting our differences   to realize our common ideals. What we need in the twenty-first century is united values  united ideals  a united world and the United Nations. "
"128",5253,"NOR",62,2007,"Two days ago  world leaders met here in this Hall and made strong statements on the urgent need to address climate change. We heard the Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  Mr. Pachauri  present compelling evidence on the state of the world climate. He outlined a dire picture of the future state of the planet if strong and joint action is not taken. We have no time to lose.  It is imperative that we reach a comprehensive post-Kyoto agreement. The new agreement must be firmly anchored in the United Nations  and it must include all major emitting countries and all major sectors. When we meet in Bali in December we should agree on the roadmap for the coming negotiations.  The industrialized countries bear a special responsibility for the current state of our atmosphere. Therefore  they must also take special responsibility for bringing the global emissions of greenhouse gases back to a sustainable level. Our long-term goal should be to avoid temperature increases above two degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial level.  Meeting the challenge of climate change is within our reach. However  it requires that our response be strong and coherent. We need to provide the worldwide private sector with strong incentives for cutting emissions. That is why it is essential to put a price on carbon emissions and to expand the carbon market.  Seven years ago  I was one of the 189 heads of State or Government who signed the Millennium Declaration. We undertook a commitment to deliver on the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However  unless we make an extra effort  we will not fulfil the promises we made to the people of the world. In particular  we are lagging behind in fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on child and maternal health. Every year almost ten million children die before the age of five. Many lives can be saved using inexpensive and effective vaccines.  Norway has contributed to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) since its inception in the year 2000. We have already managed to save more than two million lives through this alliance. But we need to move beyond vaccination.   Each year two million babies die before the sun sets on their first day of life. The four million newborns who die in their first month might survive if they were breastfed and had access to antibiotics and health workers. And not only newborns  but their mothers as well. Each year 500 000 women die in connection with childbirth. Simple  affordable measures can save millions.  Today Norway  together with other Governments  agencies and civil society  launched a global campaign to do precisely that: save millions of lives. The campaign's main thrusts are organizing and financing survival; ensuring that health personnel treat more patients and file fewer reports; and changing the financing mechanism so that treating patients becomes a source of income rather than a cost for health systems. Today we are launching an advocacy campaign for women and children to ensure that our message will reach every corner of the world. I am also pleased to announce that we are building a network of global leaders to oversee and ensure that the women and children will indeed be given priority. Today  let me also announce that Norway is pledging $1 billion over 10 years to support the Millennium Development Goals on child and maternal health.   The global campaign that we launched today  builds directly on the recommendations from the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence  which I had the privilege of chairing together with my colleagues from Pakistan and Mozambique.  We need a strong and efficient United Nations; we need a United Nations that delivers results; we need a United Nations that delivers on the Millennium Development Goals. Addressing these challenges was the mandate of the Panel. The Panel held meetings in many parts of the world and listened to countries  regional groups  citizens groups  voluntary organizations and many individuals. In November last year we presented our report (A/61/583) and recommendations to the Secretary-General. They are an honest attempt to boost the Organization's ability to live up to its potential. At the heart of our report  we recommend establishing ""One United Nations"" in each country: one leader  one programme  one budget and one office  wherever feasible. Also - equally important for a better functioning United Nations: we need a better focused management system at Headquarters level. The Sustainable Development Board aims at precisely that.  The Panel set out with ambitions driven by a sense of responsibility  knowing that our most important constituency is not the United Nations itself  but those millions of people who do not enjoy the prosperity and freedom that many of us take for granted. Yet those people  whose life situation gave rise to the Millennium Development Goals  who right now wonder how they will make it through the day - it is for the sake of those poor and destitute people that we must have an efficient United Nations  one that is well governed and well funded and that will remain a global repository of hope.  That is why we are under an obligation to take a fresh look at the way in which we have come to build a fragmented United Nations  one that risks being weakened  marginalized and less relevant. We have worked with the United Nations system to abolish diseases  such as smallpox  and repressive regimes  such as apartheid. And we continue our struggle to abolish poverty  child mortality  torture and inhuman and degrading treatment - and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  Today more and more people are breaking out of poverty. We have never had greater capacities to bridge the gaps between us  but we cannot allow the international community to waste resources or to work towards the Millennium Development Goals in anything but the most effective and rewarding ways. We must focus our work  measure our results and show that development  as organized by the United Nations  pays high rewards.  That is why we need to be open-minded  recognizing that the most radical step we can take is to do nothing. I am pleased to see the progress being made in the eight pilot countries  where the ""One United Nations' model is being implemented in practice. I am also pleased to see that these countries have adopted different ""One United Nations' processes and models that are tailored to each country's specific situation. This shows that there is no blueprint.  United Nations funds and programmes operating in the field are already responding. Increasingly  we see better coordination and stronger leadership. I commend the United Nations bodies that have adopted the new guiding principles  and I appeal to the others to follow suit.   The Panel's report sets out a way forward. The United Nations has not broken down  but it requires maintenance; therefore  the Panel did not propose revolutionary changes. Rather  we put forward some practical  achievable and effective measures  building on the thrust of decisions already made by Member States. New gender architecture is urgently needed. I urge Member States to demonstrate the required vision and leadership. This will be an important task for this General Assembly.   Norway prides itself on being a friend of the United Nations. We support multilateral solutions to common problems  but a true friend does not refrain from speaking out when change and improvement are required. We believe in international development cooperation; we believe in a strong and efficient United Nations; therefore  we would like to reform the United Nations.  "
"129",5299,"NPL",62,2007,"I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session and pledge Nepal’s support in the successful execution of his duties. I would also like to place on record our appreciation of the leadership of Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa during the sixty-first session. My delegation expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his stewardship of the United Nations and wishes him a very successful tenure.  The United Nations today remains the only truly global Organization to seek solutions to the world’s most pressing issues. The increasing importance of multilateralism has made the United Nations indispensable. The principles and purposes enshrined in the United Nations Charter should continue to guide us to address all the issues that confront us. Nepal has adopted these purposes and principles as the basic tenets of its foreign policy.  The General Assembly has before it an important agenda that seeks to deal with the world’s most pressing issues and problems. I fully agree with the priorities that the President of the General Assembly has outlined for this session.  The pledge of a road map for development in the form of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains to be fully achieved. As we approach the half-way point  this Assembly should review the progress made to devise ways and means for achieving the full and effective implementation of the commitments made in the Millennium Declaration. The follow-up conference on Financing for Development to be held in Doha in 2008 should be used as an opportunity to effectively meet the financing gap and explore innovative ways of financing for development.  We commend the Secretary-General for convening a high-level meeting on climate change. I hope that the momentum generated will pave the way for an agreement on climate change with long-term and comprehensive global commitments beyond 2012  starting the process in Bali later this year.  Climate change is linked to human security  social and economic development and environmental protection. Scientific studies point out that a solution to climate change is within human reach and that we can achieve it without compromising economic development and human progress  if we start to act now.  Climate change demands a coordinated and comprehensive global response. As enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should be the basis for addressing the challenges of climate change. Mandatory targets for emissions reduction are necessary in order to stabilize the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere at safe levels. Industrialized countries should assume leadership and demonstrate the necessary political will in adopting long-term commitments to reduce emissions.  While sea levels are rising  the Himalayan glaciers are retreating  and surrounding areas are witnessing an increasing intensity of disasters induced by climate-change  such as glacial lake outbursts  extreme rainfalls  recurring floods and massive landslides.  The President returned to the Chair.  It is ironic that the world’s most vulnerable countries  such as least developed and small island countries  get the worst affects of climate change although they are the least responsible for the same. In the new compact in climate change  there should be special provisions for addressing the mitigation and adaptation needs of the least developed countries (LDCs) and small island nations to address their special vulnerabilities.  Nepal stands firm against any form of terrorism. We have been implementing the provisions of various United Nations Security Council resolutions to combat international terrorism. Effective implementation of the provisions of the United Nations global counter-terrorism study adopted last year can foster international cooperation against terrorism. We call for an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. There should be a coordinated global response  including through the mechanism at the United Nations  to address the underlying social  economic and political causes of the existence and spread of global terrorism.  Reform of the United Nations has constantly engaged us. We need to reflect contemporary realities for making the Organization more effective  representative  responsive and capable of handling the increasingly complex global problems. The General Assembly needs to be further strengthened as a true decision-making body. We should develop an effective mechanism to implement its decisions.  The reform of the United Nations should include reform of its Security Council. We support extending membership in both permanent and non-permanent categories to reflect the realities of the day. We feel that India  Brazil  Germany and Japan deserve permanent places in the expanded Council  while Africa should also be fairly represented. We also favour a tangible improvement in the working methods of the Council  and we welcome the agreement that the General Assembly should start the intergovernmental negotiations on this important issue as soon as possible.  Nepal welcomes the restructuring of the peacekeeping-related departments of the United Nations Secretariat  including the creation of a new Department of Field Support. In view of the increasing complexity and size of the peacekeeping operations  we hope these changes will further enhance effectiveness of peacekeeping operations and ensure the safety and security of peacekeeping personnel.  Nepal has continuously participated in the in United Nations peacekeeping operations for last five decades. To this date  Nepal has sent more than 60 000 troops to over 30 United Nations missions. At present  Nepal is the fourth largest contributor of troops and police personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions. Nepalese Blue Helmets have been commended for performing extremely well in all circumstances. Many have sacrificed their invaluable lives to the cause of peace worldwide.  Peacekeeping is the soul of the United Nations  its largest function and the most successful invention in the realm of international relations. This enterprise can succeed only with meaningful participation of troop-contributing countries in decision-making processes and their increasing role in senior positions.  Nepal stands for general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction  including biological  chemical and nuclear weapons under effective international control in a time-bound manner.  We are concerned by the lack of progress in major multilateral negotiations in disarmament  including in nuclear disarmament  and in control of illegal proliferation of small arms and light weapons. We call upon Member States  especially the nuclear weapon States  to step up measures for disarmament to release much-needed dividends for development. We hope that the newly established office of High Representative for Disarmament Affairs will infuse dynamism into the process.  We look forward to the inauguration of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament for Asia and the Pacific soon in Kathmandu  in accordance with resolution 61/94  adopted by the Assembly last year for relocation of this centre. The Government of Nepal and the United Nations Secretariat have already signed the host country agreement and the memorandum of understanding to this effect. Through this Centre  Nepal is committed to revitalizing the process of regional disarmament  including the Kathmandu process.  The ideals of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) remain as valid today as they were when the Movement was founded. The principled position of the NAM countries should guide the Assembly’s deliberations. I wish to reiterate Nepal’s commitment to the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement  including the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and the peaceful coexistence of States.  The Group of 77 and China has become highly relevant in advancing the interests of the developing countries in the United Nations. The Assembly should continue to protect the interests of the developing countries. We also need to advance meaningful South-South cooperation to complement global partnership and North-South cooperation.  We call for concerted efforts to address the special needs and difficulties of the LDCs and the landlocked developing countries  including the negative impacts and marginalization of globalization. We urge the developed countries to meet the targeted official development assistance to the LDCs  give products of the LDCs duty-free  quota-free and unhindered market access and extend debt relief measures to cover all LDCs. We should ensure effective implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action for LDCs for the rest of decade  based on the mid-term review held last year.  I would like to draw the attention of the development partners to addressing the special needs of the LDCs emerging from conflict and the need to support them financially and technically  to help them achieve sustained peace and development and prevent a relapse into the conflict situation.  The landlocked developing countries face special difficulties in the transit and transport of goods and services to and from the sea. The Almaty Programme should be sincerely implemented for meaningful cooperation in transit  transport and trade facilitation in the landlocked developing countries. The mid-term review process of the Programme  to be held in 2008  should focus on fulfilling gaps in implementation of the agreed commitments.  We must not further delay the World Trade Organization trade negotiations for advancing the Doha Development Agenda. Those negotiations should find ways to further protect the interests of the least developed and landlocked countries to make them able to compete in global markets. In particular  the international community must meet the resources gap  operationalize aid for trade initiatives  strengthen trading capacities and support trade adjustment costs in the LDCs and the landlocked developing countries.   Nepal welcomes the proposal for United Nations system-wide coherence on development  environment and humanitarian issues. This process should strengthen the national and regional focus and country ownership of development programmes.  We support effective gender architecture in the United Nations and an even stronger regional and country presence of the United Nations on gender issues. Nepal accords high priority to promotion of women’s right  gender equality and the empowerment of women. A parliamentary declaration adopted on  30 May 2006 has provided for equal property and citizenship rights to women and for their representation in at least one third of the elected bodies  including in the Parliament.  Nepal is committed to the protection and promotion of the rights of children  including those affected by conflict. The peace agreement provides for immediate release of children if found recruited as combatants and their rehabilitation and integration back into their families. The Government is committed to implementing recommendations of the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict in Nepal.  The United Nations has been rather slow to respond to the world’s major conflicts and humanitarian crises  in places ranging from the Middle East to Darfur and Somalia. Although the agreement on the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur is a step forward  there were missed opportunities in addressing the long-standing humanitarian crisis in that region.  The situations in Afghanistan and Iraq demand more proactive United Nations engagement. The Organization should continue to play a constructive role in helping those countries to achieve stabilization  national unity and reconciliation.  We support the democratic aspirations of people all over the world. We hope that a solution to Myanmar’s internal situation will be found by the people of that country through dialogue and the democratic process.  Since 1990  Nepal has been sheltering more than 100 000 refugees from Bhutan on humanitarian grounds. There is a stalemate in this long-standing crisis  mainly because of Bhutan’s reluctance to implement the agreements already reached or to engage in negotiations with a view to finding some other acceptable solution. That procrastination has caused refugees to run out of patience. The true solution to this problem lies in giving refugees the opportunity to be able to return to Bhutan and to participate in the country’s political process in a fully democratic way  taking into account the people’s cultural diversity and human rights. However  we are positively considering the offers made by some countries to give refugees the voluntary option of third-country resettlement  should they so choose it  as part of a provisional solution. That should not absolve Bhutan of its responsibility towards its exiled citizens  which is a problem between the refugees and the Bhutanese regime. Nepal appreciates the continued humanitarian assistance extended by the international community  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other agencies for the care of refugees.  Nepal is in the process of leaving behind its decade-long internal conflict though a unique and internally driven peace process. We are committed to bringing that process to a successful conclusion. The Government is engaged in dialogue with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) to ensure that the elections to the Constituent Assembly are held on 22 November  thus sincerely honouring and implementing the commitments set out in the peace agreements.   It was through dialogue that the Government of Nepal recently concluded agreements with the leaders of the Madhesi Janajati movement  enabling them to a have stronger voice in the political arena and broader representation in the Constituent Assembly.  Despite the challenges associated with the peace process  the Government is determined to hold the elections to the Constituent Assembly on time. With the necessary technical  legal and logistical competence  the Election Commission has made preparations for holding the elections as scheduled and in a free and fair manner. I would like to invite friendly countries and organizations to send observers to Nepal during the elections.  The people of Nepal have expressed their desire for a peaceful political and socio-economic transformation. They have spoken out in favour of an inclusive  democratic and participatory restructuring of the State. I have every confidence that the peace process will reap numerous dividends for the Nepalese people through the creation of a new Nepal. In that process  we expect generous assistance from our development partners  including assistance in meeting Nepal’s reconstruction and development needs.  On behalf of the people and the Government of Nepal  I wish to express sincere gratitude to the international community for its strong support and solidarity during our struggle for democracy and our ongoing peace process.  Last year  we invited the United Nations to facilitate the peace process through arms monitoring and through technical support for the Constituent Assembly elections. We express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his personal attention and interest in assisting the peace process. We also commend the role played by the United Nations Mission in Nepal in that process.  The Government is steadfast in protecting and promoting human rights  in keeping with its international commitments. We welcome the adoption by the Human Rights Council of the universal periodic review of all Member States. That exercise should be free from politicization  selectivity and double standards.  There has been a remarkable improvement in the protection of human rights in Nepal since the start of the peace process. The Government has extended full cooperation to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal. The recent appointment of members of the National Human Rights Commission of Nepal is expected to further enhance our national capability to protect and promote human rights.  The Government is determined to bring an end to the environment of impunity that was present during the armed conflict. We hope that the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission  as stipulated in the peace agreement  will also help us to put our past behind us and to prevent a recurrence of such grave human rights violations.   As a nation that has a diverse ethnic composition and that is home to various indigenous peoples  Nepal welcomes the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the General Assembly this year. We hope that the Declaration will serve as a useful reference for indigenous issues throughout the world.  In conclusion  the General Assembly has before it an important opportunity to address the most pressing issues of our times   issues that are of lasting significance. We should strive to advance agreements to address climate change  follow up on the Millennium Development Goals  seek new resources for development financing  break the impasse in the negotiations on trade and disarmament and reform the Security Council. We should also seek solutions to unresolved conflicts and humanitarian crises.  Today  the world's major problems demand the leadership of the United Nations. We should rise to the occasion and demonstrate our ability to work together to solve urgent problems that confront us. Solutions to most global problems are within our reach if we act in unison  guided by our collective wisdom and reason. Together  we can make progress in all these areas. I pledge Nepal’s constructive participation in arriving at important decisions on all these issues here at the United Nations.  The President: Before proceeding further  I would like to remind members that  as announced in today’s Journal  the informal meeting of the plenary to observe the first International Day of Non-Violence will be held tomorrow  2 October  from 9.30 to 10 a.m. in this Hall. All are invited to attend. "
"130",5316,"NRU",62,2007,"I would like to express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. My delegation also wishes to commend his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  particularly in addressing the difficult issues that continue to prevent revitalization of the General Assembly and reform of the Security Council. My delegation offers its full cooperation and support towards the President’s commitment to continuing with the Organization’s overall reform agenda and addressing the many challenges ahead.  As this is the first General Assembly session to be convened since the appointment of His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General  my delegation takes this opportunity to assure him of Nauru’s firm support and full cooperation in his leadership of the United Nations.  I am deeply honoured to be addressing this body for the third consecutive year  this time as the recently returned leader of our small island State of Nauru. As members are no doubt aware  when I first took up office  three years ago  my country was on the brink of collapse. While Nauru was once a small donor country with a high income  our wealth was squandered in a single generation through gross mismanagement and corruption on the part of previous Governments. Our past record of poor governance and the need to rebuild Nauru were the main reasons that our national sustainable development strategy was initiated by our Government and given one of its fundamental goals: the establishment and operation of a transparent and accountable Government.  My Government is slowly but diligently working to improve Nauru. Over our three-year term  we will continue to do so  on a platform of both economic and political reform  together with good governance. We believe that we are improving our situation  and the August election results tell us that we have our people’s confidence. But it is a slow and painful recovery  and we appreciate all the help that we can get.  We appreciate the fact that the United Nations is strongly aware of the development challenges in the Pacific region and that it is also cognizant that assistance has not translated into uniform human development gains in many places  with the result that the Pacific is in danger of missing many targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In that respect  my delegation welcomes and supports the President’s intention to hold a leaders’ meeting on the MDGs during the present session.  During the general debate at the sixty-first session (see A/61/PV.16)  we noted in this historic Hall that the offices and agencies of the United Nations had no permanent presence in many of the small island developing States of the Pacific. In June 2006  it was announced that a coalition comprising the United Nations Development Programme  UNICEF and the United Nations Population Fund would open a total of eight new offices in Pacific island countries  including my own country  Nauru. We welcomed that historic announcement  the progress that it marked towards harmonization with the United Nations and the assistance and support that the new offices would provide in developing national capacity and meeting the MDGs.  As Member States that pay our dues  deploy peacekeepers and discharge our responsibilities in the international community  we deserve offices that enhance the relevance of the United Nations and the implementation of its policies. We have therefore been severely disappointed by the lack of progress in establishing acceptable offices in our countries since the announcement. The delaying of that initiative  and the assumptions on the part of the United Nations concerning the capabilities of our small island States to recruit staff for such offices  are also short-sighted. Moreover  the Organization’s definition of “partnership” for the initiative places a significant burden on our national Governments. It fails to respond to our national priorities and our lack of resources  and therefore weakens the cohesion between the Organization and our countries.  Despite the lack of visible progress  we are of the view that the project can be salvaged with its original intentions and goals intact if there is a will and a sincere desire to respond to our needs. So we ask the General Assembly and the Secretariat to ensure that offices befitting the ideals and the reputation of the United Nations are opened in our countries. We want to see the United Nations on the ground in Nauru and throughout the Pacific region  providing a helping hand in our pursuit of sustainable development.  There can be no doubt that our Pacific region is doing its best to implement the commitments made under the Mauritius Strategy and other international agreements regarding small island developing States. The relevant report of the Secretary-General (A/62/279) makes that very clear  showing that under its Pacific Plan  the Pacific region has agreed to and is vigorously pursuing its own sustainable development priorities  which reflect and acknowledge our international commitments under the Strategy. The Secretary-General’s report and the Pacific Plan updates show progress in some key areas and identify important initiatives for follow-up action.  However  it is also quite clear that we and the United Nations need to do much more. That fact is glaringly obvious in the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  which warns of a narrowing window of opportunity available for slowing down global warming and climate change. This is an issue that reveals some of the inequities in the current world development paradigm: the small island countries contribute very little to the problem but are likely to be the worst affected.  The need to do more also stares us in the face from recent reports on the progress  or lack thereof  in achieving MDGs. Our region is struggling in many areas of the MDGs  and it is fair to say  as the Secretary-General’s report notes  that persistent capacity constraints are a key obstacle to the implementation of sustainable development in the Pacific region   this includes Nauru.  Therefore  I take this opportunity to express my people’s warmest appreciation to our development partners  led by Australia  Taiwan  New Zealand  Japan  the European Union and others  for their support in this and other areas  without which we would have completely collapsed as a nation and as a people. However  I hope the Assembly can appreciate that our region  although vast  suffers both from isolation and the relatively small size of its countries and populations.   Even with the best practices in management and governance  our economies’ sustainable development is impeded by high transportation costs and diseconomies of scale. In Nauru  freight adds at least 15 to 20 per cent to the cost of all imports. Likewise  affordable and sustainable alternative energy forms are a high priority for my country and region because  with the ever increasing cost of fossil fuel  we are having to pay a high premium for something that contributes both to global warming and to our potential demise as Pacific islands.   Professor Jeffrey Sachs has rightly said that  while we all need to work together to solve world poverty  the opportunity is there for the developed countries with their resources and technology to do something about ending it once and for all. The agreed official development assistance (ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of a gross national product is far from being achieved. This highlights the opportunity for the world to do much more to both alleviate poverty and remove the constraints that frustrate the progress of many developing countries.  Like other highly indebted countries  mine is doubly burdened by a massive debt left to us by previous Governments. After careful assessment of Nauru’s development potential for the next thirty years  we have come to the sad conclusion that Nauru will only be able to service a very small portion of that debt. We will need to seek the forgiveness of those countries and institutions to which we owe most of the money.   This Organization prides itself on being inclusive and on being a champion to everyone; yet my delegation is extremely disappointed that  despite the efforts of Nauru and other allies of this cause  the United Nations continues to ignore the expressed wish of Taiwan and its 23 million people to become a member of this Organization.  On the 19 July this year  an application for membership to the United Nations was delivered to the Office of the Secretary-General  signed by the democratically elected President of Taiwan  His Excellency Chen Shui-bian. Unfortunately  the United Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the Security Council were then contravened. Owing to poor legal advice  the Office of the Secretary-General failed to forward Taiwan’s application for membership to the Security Council  citing General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) for its failure. Even though many Member States continue to hide behind resolution 2758 (XXVI)  it should be realized that this resolution does not declare that Taiwan is a part of the People’s Republic of China  nor does it preclude Taiwan from future membership of this body. It certainly does not support the so-called one China principle.  Ever since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China on 1 October 1949  the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been governed separately  with neither side exercising any control or jurisdiction over the other. Let me be absolutely clear: Taiwan has no intention of representing the People’s Republic of China. Taiwan is a free and peace-loving sovereign State  and its democratically elected Government is the sole legitimate Government of their island State.   Apart from the legal and moral rights of Taiwan to be part of the United Nations  there is another dimension that needs to be taken into account. Taiwan is one of the largest economies in the world  including being one of the larger trading partners of other Members of the United Nations. It is also one of the top twenty sources of world foreign investment and is well positioned to assist many of the members of this body in their development  which it has already demonstrated. Taiwan is a very important investor and trading partner for my country and others in my  region   even for those that do not recognize it formally.   My delegation calls on the Office of the Secretary-General to uphold the integrity of this pre-eminent Organization and conform to the United Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the Security Council. It must immediately accept and submit to the Security Council Taiwan’s application for membership.   Peoples of the world look to the United Nations and to their leaders to identify and act on major global challenges that confront the world today. Earlier this week  we concluded a High-Level Event on Climate Change. Our discussions encompassed a variety of views and proposals that we all hope will lead to global resolve to achieve significant changes. Nauru takes the view that the international community  particularly those countries with the capacity that comes with their status as developed nations  has a responsibility to provide financial  humanitarian and other assistance to small island developing States that stand to suffer the most dire consequences of global climate change.   Of course  we must acknowledge and express gratitude for those aid policies that have been proposed and established  but more is needed to avert a potential disaster  especially to the vulnerable small island nations. Therefore  we ask that ongoing efforts be continued and urge Member States to consider increasing their financial support  including easier access to the Adaptation Fund.  However  capital investments alone are not sufficient. Technology  skills and knowledge are required to guide us in our response to the present challenge. Furthermore  civil society and non-governmental organizations must cooperate with each other in acquiring and building the capacity we need to address this problem.   The world situation demands a renewed  revitalized and more responsive United Nations now more than ever. We need to see the strengthening of this multilateral institution through the revitalization of the General Assembly and comprehensive reform of the Security Council through intergovernmental negotiations. All of that must move forward with a common vision for a more coherent United Nations system capable of delivering as one  sparing no efforts to continue strengthening the three pillars of peace and security  development and human rights.   Nauru is of the view that the comprehensive reform of the Security Council will not be complete without Japan  India  Brazil and Germany as permanent members.  In closing  I wish to remind this Assembly of the Secretary-General’s recent observation of the United Nations  whereupon he stated: “The true measure of success for the United Nations is not how much we promise  but how much we deliver for those who need us most.” (A/61/PV.31) As we move forward our discussions on the many challenging and complex issues before us  let us do so with the best of intentions  and more importantly  let us make good our promise to deliver.   Finally  while I stand in this great country of the United States of America  the land of the free  I cannot help but remember that its people have put their trust in God. On my island country of Nauru  also a land of the free  we have placed our belief in God’s will first. Therefore  to every human being on our planet Earth  I beseech each and every one of us to dedicate ourselves to hold true to our God’s will. "
"131",5363,"NZL",62,2007,"As we meet for the sixty-second session of the General Assembly  we look again to the United Nations as the global forum to address the challenges which affect us all.  Climate change is serious and urgent  as many have said in this Hall. We welcome that it has been the theme of our general debate this year. The science is clear. Climate change is real and will impact on all parts of the world. To meet the global challenge of climate change  there must be widespread and effective international action. It will be important to get all economies onto low carbon pathways over time. Market mechanisms will have a significant role to play. Individual countries will face different challenges. Different national circumstances must be taken into account.  The United Nations climate change conference in Bali in December will be a fresh opportunity to re-energize our efforts in addressing climate change. New Zealand wants to see a Bali road map emerge in December to set us on the course for an effective future response. New Zealand welcomes the momentum that is being generated by other high-level meetings in the lead-up to Bali  including the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders’ Declaration.  Last week’s high-level event deserves special mention. We congratulate the Secretary-General for his efforts in cultivating the political goodwill that will be vital if we are to reach agreement in Bali.   Taking action as an international community also means taking action domestically. In recent weeks  New Zealand has announced a number of domestic measures to address climate change. An emissions trading scheme will be established from 1 January 2008 and will form the cornerstone of our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will  over time  cover all sectors and all gases.  We have also identified a number of longer-term domestic goals  which will move New Zealand down the path to carbon neutrality. They will provide benefits  including healthier homes  cleaner air and improved public transport. While climate change is certainly a challenge for us all  it is also an opportunity to move towards a more sustainable world.  With regard to the Millennium Development Goals  we recognize that having passed the halfway point to 2015  the international community needs to step up its efforts to achieve them. At the same time  there is scope for the United Nations development system to be strengthened. We welcome the newly established initiatives in the Economic and Social Council   the Annual Ministerial Review and the Development Cooperation Forum   as practical ways to share information about what is working and where we can improve our efforts at country level.  New Zealand is also committed to improving system-wide coherence at the United Nations in the fields of development  humanitarian issues and the environment. We attach particular importance to working for a strengthened  coherent  gender architecture and towards effective gender mainstreaming across all United Nations entities.  New Zealand welcomes the completion of the United Nations Pacific-based development agencies’ strategic framework for the Pacific. We are keen to work closely with United Nations agencies in the Pacific to achieve positive outcomes for our partners in the areas of human rights  sexual and reproductive heath  HIV/AIDS  child immunization and women’s leadership.  A strong  prosperous and stable Pacific is a key foreign policy priority for New Zealand. We place a high priority on fostering solidarity and cooperation in the Pacific to tackle the challenges the region faces in democracy  security and economic development. Around half of New Zealand’s development assistance goes towards the Pacific.   New Zealand provides assistance in the region in Timor-Leste  the Solomon Islands  Tonga and Bougainville in Papua New Guinea  with each situation calling for a different response.  The Timorese people  their leaders and the international community have all made a huge effort over the past year to return Timor-Leste to a more secure and stable path. New Zealand has participated in those efforts through our contributions to the International Security Forces and to the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT). Timor-Leste will require a sustained commitment from UNMIT.   The situation in Fiji continues to be of concern to New Zealand. As a neighbour of Fiji with a long-standing and very close relationship  New Zealand worked hard to avert last December’s coup  including by convening a meeting to mediate between the then Prime Minister and the military commander. We very much regret that this failed to dissuade the coup makers from their illegal and unconstitutional path.  New Zealand strongly and actively supports the steps that have been taken by the Pacific Islands Forum to encourage an early return to constitutional government in Fiji. We would welcome a firm commitment from the interim administration to work towards elections within the timeframe endorsed by the Forum. Given that commitment  New Zealand would begin to restore a more normal bilateral relationship through which we could cooperate in addressing Fiji’s undoubtedly complex problems.  I also want to take this opportunity to address one issue in particular raised in the Solomon Islands statement on Monday (see ). It was suggested  inter alia  that the presence of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI)  was an “occupation”  and that RAMSI’s operation transgressed Article 52 of the United Nations Charter. New Zealand has always been committed to upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter in every respect. In our view  RAMSI is entirely consistent with those purposes and principles. It is a specific example of Chapter VIII of the Charter in operation. To suggest it is contrary to the Charter is in our view wrong. RAMSI was established in response to a formal request from the Solomon Islands. Its presence in the Solomon Islands is sanctioned by treaty and by the domestic law of the Solomon Islands. That was recently reaffirmed by the Solomon Islands Parliament. Moreover  RAMSI stems from the endorsement by Pacific Islands Forum Foreign Ministers of a programme of action under the Forum Leaders’ Biketawa Declaration. That provides a framework for regional responses in times of crisis or when members request assistance   exactly the situation in this case.  Amid all these challenges  I would like to report on activity being undertaken by Tokelau  the tiny territory 500 kilometres north of Samoa that New Zealand administers. The people of Tokelau  all 1 500 of them on three atolls  have decided that they wish to undertake an act of self-determination to decide whether they wish to change their present status. A vote in February 2006 narrowly missed the threshold set by Tokelau for a change of status. They will again vote on that issue from 20 to 24 October.  As members of the Special Committee on Decolonization know  New Zealand supports Tokelau’s right to choose  but has stood back from any wish to determine the direction of any change. That decision is entirely for the people of Tokelau. New Zealand will support their decision.  Advancement of the rule of law at the national and international levels is essential for the realization of sustained economic growth  development and human rights. New Zealand encourages members to provide their full support to the International Criminal Court (ICC) by acceding to the Rome Statute of the ICC. We also call on all United Nations Member States  especially State parties to the Rome Stature  to fully cooperate with the Court in carrying out its current work. Universality and full support are crucial if we are to end the impunity of the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of international concern  such as those carried out in Darfur  where International Criminal Court arrest warrants are outstanding.  Efforts to protect and maintain the international rule of law can only be effective when built on a foundation of international peace and security.  Interfaith and intercultural dialogue can help to counter religious extremism by encouraging understanding and respect among different faith communities and cultures.  In May  New Zealand hosted two significant gatherings aimed at advancing global response to interfaith and intercultural issues in a practical way. We regard the United Nations’ Alliance of Civilizations as the key multilateral process among the growing number of international and regional initiatives in this area.  With respect to nuclear proliferation  New Zealand welcomes the strong signals that have been sent to North Korea and Iran by the Security Council.  On a different topic  New Zealand is convinced that the humanitarian harm posed by cluster munitions must be addressed urgently. We believe that negotiation of a treaty to deal with the problems caused by cluster mines is well overdue. We will host a meeting on this initiative in February of next year.  We are pleased  too  to promote a new initiative at the General Assembly this year calling for action to lower the operational status of nuclear weapons. Maintaining nuclear weapons at a high level of readiness increases the likelihood of these weapons being used  with catastrophic consequences.  The humanitarian disaster and conflict in Darfur threaten security in the entire East African region. New Zealand applauds the efforts by Members to establish the new African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.  New Zealand is deeply concerned at the current political  economic and humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. We welcome the efforts being made to find acceptable solutions to the problems Zimbabwe faces. We sincerely hope that these efforts continue and that solutions can be found that will benefit all Zimbabweans and will enable free and fair elections to be held.  New Zealand remains profoundly concerned at the situation in Myanmar. Protestors have been killed  shot at  beaten and arrested. This violent treatment is reprehensible. Engaging in peaceful protests is a fundamental human right. New Zealand  therefore  joins others in calling for the immediate release of those detained in recent weeks  along with the many political prisoners  including Aung San Suu Kyi  who have been held without trial for much longer periods.  The Myanmar regime should be held responsible for the personal safety and treatment of all the people it has detained. We call on the authorities there to stop the violence and to encourage a process of genuine dialogue with pro-democracy leaders and ethnic minorities.  New Zealand fully supports United Nations efforts to resolve the immediate and longer term situation in Myanmar. We welcomed the visit to Myanmar of Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari. We fully support continued discussion of the situation of Myanmar in the Security Council with a view to considering what further steps might be taken by the international community.  Turning now to human rights  New Zealand will stand for election to the Human Rights Council for 2009 to 2012. We want to do our part to help this fledging United Nations organization achieve its full potential as the pre-eminent global human rights body.  A human rights issue of particular importance to New Zealand is the death penalty. Adoption of a resolution on a global moratorium on this inhumane form of punishment would represent a historic step towards global efforts to abolish the death penalty.  In closing  New Zealand has been a committed and active participant in the United Nations since its formation. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called on Member States to deliver to the best of our abilities at the United Nations  recognizing the need for faster  more effective action  as well as for a more results-driven Organization that strives to have the highest standards of transparency and professional ethics. New Zealand whole-heartedly agrees.   We look forward to working closely with the Secretary-General  with you  Mr. President and with other Member States in all of our efforts to build a stronger United Nations for a better world. "
"132",5407,"OMN",62,2007,"At the  outset  it gives me pleasure to extend to the President and his friendly country  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  my country’s warmest congratulations on Mr. Kerim’s assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are confident that his vast diplomatic experience will help us to achieve desired objectives and will steer the Assembly to a successful conclusion. Let me also pay tribute to his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Al-Khalifa  from the sisterly Kingdom of Bahrain  for the optimal manner in which she so ably and wisely conducted the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session.  I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his appointment as Secretary-General of the United Nations. We are confident that he will render valuable services to this Organization  with his vast experience in both political and diplomatic fields. I assure him of my delegation’s readiness to offer all the necessary assistance to help him discharge his responsibilities. We wish him every success. I would like also to commend Mr. Kofi Annan for all the efforts he made to promote the work of this Organization during his tenure as Secretary-General.  The annual session of the General Assembly provides us with the opportunity to address various regional and international issues and to express our concerns and interests. I would like to point out here that the efforts exerted by the United Nations have helped us to understand the process of addressing many international problems  including the important question of the Middle East.  Despite the fact that efforts made to address the situations in Palestine  Iraq  Darfur  Somalia and other areas have so far failed to provide conclusive solutions  they are nevertheless positive indications demonstrating the willingness and determination of the international community to shoulder its responsibilities in order to end the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis of establishing a Palestinian State living in peace side by side with the State of Israel.  The withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967  the establishment of the State of Palestine and the withdrawal of Israel from the Syrian Golan Heights and Lebanese Shaba’a farms will promote security and stability in the Middle East region. This will encourage the development of cooperation among the countries and peoples of the region. We sense that there are positive trends and new convictions among Israeli political leaders  and in Israeli society at large  on the need to reach a peaceful solution based on the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  in order to put an end to decades of conflict in the Middle East region.  It is necessary to point out here that Arab States have on many occasions stressed their conviction that  the achievement of a just and equitable peace with Israel depends on the withdrawal of Israel to the borders of 1967. Establishing such a peace is the Arab States’ strategic choice.  We call upon the international community  especially the major Powers  to promote this positive conviction within Israel and the Arab States in the interest of achieving peace.  Iraqi blood continues to be spilled. We believe that the extension of the new responsibilities of the United Nations in Iraq  in accordance with Security Council resolution 1770 (2007)  is a positive step that commands our full support. In this respect  we urge our brothers in Iraq  especially the Iraqi Government  to move from a stage of discord to a stage of problem-solving in the national interest of Iraq.  We are optimistic about the sincere efforts exerted by the Sudanese Government and the African Union to reach a political settlement among the various Sudanese parties in Darfur. We support the tripartite agreement signed by that Government  the United Nations and the African Union  on providing support to African forces and on deploying more troops in Darfur to restore security and achieve success in the negotiations between the Sudanese Government and the opposition groups in Darfur.  Somalia is still suffering the consequences of a civil war that has claimed the lives of thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. We believe that accord among the different Somali factions is the only way out. We also believe that the international community has a major responsibility to help Somalia restore its unity and security. To guarantee the effectiveness of the assistance given by the international community  we urge all tribes and factions in Somalia to be decisive and to help those who are trying to help them.  We have always welcomed the continued cooperation between the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran and the International Atomic and Energy Agency (IAEA). There are hopes and opportunities that augur well for a peaceful solution guaranteeing the right of Iran to benefit from peaceful nuclear technology and assuages the concerns of the international community.   We as human beings are all partners on this planet and we have to work together to build it and develop and preserve its resources. Therefore  it is important for the international community to observe the extraordinary weather conditions such as hurricanes  floods and the erosion and loss of arable land that are taking place in different continents. These phenomena have inflicted human and economic losses  displaced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes and have damaged the necessary sources of health and livelihood  in addition to other essential services.   In this context  we commend the vital role played by the United Nations and recognize its efforts in organizing the High-level Event on Climate Change that was held on 24 September. We also urge the international community to develop specific measures and identify steps and solutions to face these challenges.  More than ever before  the international community is called upon to commission environmental and scientific studies to face the dangers posed by such phenomena  in order to maintain ecological balance and diversity  which both are necessary if life is to continue on this planet. Hence  we must harness the new technological and electronic developments in order to combat pollution and preserve the environment and biological diversity. In that regard  we welcome and are pleased to be among the many States that have endorsed the special initiative on the Millennium Development Goals with regard to the call for action that was adopted recently.  We also welcome the convening of the high-level dialogue on cooperation between religions and cultures  scheduled to be held during this session in October. We hope that the meeting will succeed in adopting a futuristic view that focuses on the positive aspects  based on understanding between religions and cultures. Such understanding must be based on mutual respect for all religious beliefs and cultures.  In closing  we wish this session every success and we hope that we may be able to leave it with a vision that defines the road for the future in the service of mankind with renewed commitments among Member States to United Nations resolutions and to respect for the provisions of the Charter.

"133",5454,"PAK",62,2007,"I would like first to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to your prestigious office. Your vast political experience and diplomatic skills will undoubtedly guide the General Assembly towards success in dealing with its important agenda. I wish to express our deep satisfaction and pride at the significant achievements of your predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  during her presidency. Her stature and accomplishments symbolize the prominent role that women are playing in the Muslim world.  Let me also express our high appreciation to Mr. Ban Ki-moon for the distinctive and assiduous manner in which  as our new Secretary-General  he has engaged himself to address crises and humanitarian situations. We support the Secretary-General’s commitment to improving the United Nations so that it can respond to contemporary challenges and opportunities.  The end of the cold war at the dawn of the twenty-first century gave rise to hopes for a better future. A decade later  the world is in the grip of deepening uncertainty and rising turbulence. There are new threats of terrorism  violence and widening divisions among cultures and societies  driven by suspicion and prejudice. At the heart of that growing malaise is not a clash of values or civilizations; it is the failure of the international community to address festering disputes and our collective inability to universalize the opportunities and benefits offered by the phenomenal advances of technology and globalization for the betterment of all peoples.  Conflicts continue in Palestine  Iraq and Afghanistan. In South Asia  the Kashmir dispute is yet to be resolved. Old disputes are compounded by new confrontations. Also  serious challenges are emerging in the shape of climate change  energy security  and financial and trade imbalances.   In this complex world  the United Nations provides a critical and indispensable role. The United Nations is at the apex of expanding international interaction and remains the only acknowledged instrument for regulating global affairs on the basis of agreed principles and norms.  Terrorism is a grave and pervasive threat. Terrorism destabilizes societies. It must not be associated with any faith or culture. It must be countered and rejected  addressing both its manifestations and its root causes.  Equally disturbing are trends to malign other cultures and faiths and reinforce divisions  especially between the West and the Islamic world. Tolerating Islamophobia in the guise of freedom of expression is dangerous. More than ever before  in this globalized world we need understanding  harmony and the building of bridges among all cultures and peoples through such initiatives as the Alliance of Civilizations  interfaith dialogue and enlightened moderation.  Conflict and violence in the Middle East are fundamentally linked to the Palestinian issue that has agitated two generations of Palestinians and Muslims around the world. Essentially  Palestine is an issue of freedom. Security cannot be ensured by denying the Palestinians their freedom. Salvation lies in what the Arab nations proposed in Beirut five years ago. Pakistan supports that position. The world has a historical responsibility to end the tragedy of the Palestinian people by enabling them to establish their own State in Palestine  consistent with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the Arab peace plan. Israel must also withdraw from the other occupied Arab territories and fully respect the territorial and sovereign integrity of Lebanon. Efforts that deflect from those basic imperatives will only prolong agony and turmoil in the region.  Pakistan is deeply concerned over the grave situation in Iraq. We deplore the internecine bloodshed. Peace in Iraq can emerge only through dialogue  mutual cooperation and tolerance. It is vital both for the Iraqi people and for the region to ensure the preservation of the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and full respect for its sovereignty.  Pakistan is also disturbed by the ominous confrontation over Iran’s nuclear issue. We have insisted on recourse to diplomacy because resort to the use of force could lead to incalculable consequences for that already inflamed and highly sensitive region.  In our region  violence and the rise of terrorism and extremism are due to the developments of the nearly three decades when neighbouring Afghanistan became the last front of the cold war. Ironically  in the 1980s the struggle in Afghanistan helped the consolidation of freedom movements that culminated in the surge of freedom signified by the fall of the Berlin wall. In the 1990s  however  Afghanistan suffered international neglect and indifference until the shock and horror of 9/11 refocused international attention on that war-ravaged country.  The unfortunate happenings in our neighbourhood impacted on our own society  giving rise to terrorism and extremism  especially in the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan. We are fighting Al-Qaida and other terrorist elements with resolve and determination. We have deployed nearly 100 000 troops for that purpose. A large number of our troops have sacrificed their lives. In the tribal regions  we have taken political and administrative measures and have plans to bring about socio-economic transformation. As part of a comprehensive strategy  we have introduced reforms to counter extremism.  We are cooperating internationally and reject irresponsible comments and insinuations  especially in certain sections of the international media  casting aspersions on our intentions and efforts. It must be appreciated that the challenge is enormous and requires a sustained and protracted endeavour both locally and at the international level.  Pakistan desires a peaceful environment in the region. No country stands to gain as much as Pakistan from peace and stability in Afghanistan. We therefore support every initiative that could help the Afghans to achieve national reconciliation and to rebuild their country. The recently convened Grand Jirga in Kabul offers hope. A great deal will depend on the effectiveness of the follow-up mechanisms  especially the 50-member joint council that is mandated to reach out to the opposition to promote peace in the area. The international community also has an important responsibility to help Afghanistan with a Marshall Plan-like programme for reconstruction.  Pakistan is engaged in a peace process with India that has led to significant improvement in bilateral relations. The two countries must now seize the opportunity provided by the propitious international and regional environment to address problems  especially the Jammu and Kashmir dispute that has been at the heart of conflict and tension in South Asia. Both sides will have to demonstrate political will  courage and flexibility. We are pursuing a solution that would be acceptable to India  to Pakistan and  above all  to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.  President Pervez Musharraf has offered important ideas that have resonated with the Kashmiri people  who must be involved in the process. At the same time  it is essential to create an environment free of human rights violations in Kashmir if there is to be a sustainable peaceful solution. A peaceful settlement responding to the aspirations of the Kashmiri people will usher in a new era of mutual trust and cooperation in South Asia.  In our region  the incipient United States-India nuclear deal injects a new element. We have concerns over strategic stability  which we will maintain despite our firm opposition to an arms race in South Asia. Moreover  we also have a strong interest in developing civil nuclear power generation under international safeguards. Our nuclear and strategic assets are solely for defensive purpose. We started pursuing the nuclear option only after 1974  when the strategic balance was disrupted by the first Indian nuclear test. Our initiatives to keep South Asia free of nuclear weapons received scant response internationally. In 1998  we were again faced with a dilemma and had to respond to the Indian tests to establish deterrence. Our failure to do so would have created a dangerous ambiguity about our capability  with the risk of miscalculation.  I wish to reaffirm that our strategic capability is solely for deterrence and defence. We are opposed to an arms race and want to maintain minimum credible deterrence. We will not be the first to test in our region. We will never use our nuclear capability against non-nuclear weapon States. We remain fully committed to the objective of general and complete disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. We want to be treated as a partner rather than as a target of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. We are committed to developing nuclear power generation under international safeguards to meet our growing energy needs.  It is evident that global consensus on disarmament and non-proliferation has been seriously eroded. There are several reasons for that  including the disavowal of nuclear disarmament by the nuclear-weapon States signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); the emergence of de facto nuclear-weapon States not parties to the NPT; the failure to address the security concerns of non-nuclear-weapon States; and discrimination in the conduct of peaceful nuclear cooperation. There is an obvious need for a new and universal consensus on non-proliferation  disarmament and peaceful nuclear cooperation that eliminates dangers and risks and establishes cooperation on an equitable basis. In the coming months  the Nuclear Suppliers Group States have a heavy responsibility  as any endorsement of a selective or discriminatory approach could fatefully damage the existing consensus on disarmament and non-proliferation.  The world is slowly recognizing the existential threat posed by climate change. The special event held on 24 September has been useful in crystallizing the issues that must be addressed. Environment is a responsibility and an opportunity. The responsibility is to heal the Earth  which is scarred and degraded. The challenge goes far beyond Kyoto. Collectively  we need to restrain our avaricious and extravagant living. Opportunity lies in developing the environment as an employment sector to absorb a part of world human resources in meaningful activity. We must realize that with technological advances it will no longer be feasible to rationally utilize the entire global work force in the production  manufacturing and service sectors.  Against the backdrop of the new challenges  large parts of humanity continue to suffer from hunger  poverty and disease. That is tragic in these modern times  where the miracle of technology has empowered the world to effectively overcome the vestiges of our primitive existence. The Group of 77 has therefore insisted on a broad endeavour for sustainable development based on economic growth  social development and environmental protection. We should adopt coherent and mutually reinforcing policies and actions to advance in those three directions with the same degree of political and legal commitment. The United Nations has a central role in the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals.  Pakistan  as the current Chair of the Group of 77 and China  has suggested steps to enable developing countries to coordinate and enlarge their national development cooperation effort. In accordance with the mandate adopted at the Second South Summit  we will convene a panel of eminent experts of the South to further develop common positions for developing countries in critical areas like trade finance  technology  energy and climate change.  Pakistan agrees that the management and Secretariat of the United Nations should be reformed and modernized  especially to improve the coherence and effectiveness of the system. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz is the Co-Chair of the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence. The reform process must  however  remain sensitive to the fundamental principle of the sovereign equality of States in the decision-making process. That applies especially to the issue of the expansion of the Security Council. Security Council reform must enlarge the representation of all Member States rather than expand the circle of the privileged. The Security Council functions must also be developed in a manner so that these do not eclipse the Charter responsibilities of the General Assembly or those of the other principal organs of the United Nations.  In Pakistan  our aspirations are the same as elsewhere: to accelerate our socio-economic development  to build a knowledge-based society and to contribute to peace and development in the world consistent with the deeply held values of our faith and our vision for a modern progressive Islamic state. That has been the orientation of the Government of President Musharraf for setting priorities and introducing reform programmes. There have been significant accomplishments in strengthening institutions  promoting democratic polity and building a sound economy.  To give a few examples  today we have robust grass-roots level democratic institutions with mandatory one-third representation by women. Our minorities have been integrated into the political mainstream. Our media is free  vibrant and assertive. Our economy has seen stable growth over the past eight years  and in that period  Pakistan’s national output and per capita income has doubled. We are now preparing for elections  as our elected national and provincial assemblies will soon complete their full term of office. As we enter this important phase in our political life  we do so with the deep awareness that a strong and stable Pakistan is pivotal for the peace and progress of our region. "
"134",5497,"PAN",62,2007,"On behalf  of my country  and on my own behalf  I would like to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the sixty-second session. I should also like to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his encouraging message this morning.The Charter of the United Nations has been the subject of revisions almost from the moment it entered into force. Some of those changes were successful and timely. However  today we are acting too slowly in adapting United Nations structures to the realities of the twenty-first century  despite the fact that the Millennium Development Goals have given it new vigour and almost a new raison d’être. Although there seems to be broad agreement to strengthen the General Assembly and to make the Security Council more representative and transparent  we are spending too much time trying to decide how to do it.  Panama has been very clear in its support for the aspirations of Brazil  Japan and Germany to become permanent members of the Security Council. But we have also deemed it appropriate to offer Member States alternatives that would enable us to make progress in this debate. We urge an open mind so that we can complete this debate and come up with the relevant changes quickly.  Panama became a Security Council member with a great feeling of regional solidarity and fiduciary responsibility vis-à-vis the international community on all matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security. We are grateful for the confidence that the General Assembly placed in my country  and we are always ready to seek agreement between parties to a conflict and to help remove obstacles that stand in the way of peace and agreements. To that end  we have encouraged and supported efforts to advance democratic institutions and the rule of law  the promotion and protection of human rights and humanitarian assistance to refugees and displaced persons.  No conflict in the world has been given greater attention by the international community than that in the Middle East region. Although agreements have been arrived at that have eased tensions  the path towards peace has always been elusive  and new obstacles arise all the time. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is at the very core of the problems in the region. Panama therefore encourages and promotes negotiations between the parties  geared towards creating a Palestinian State that can live in peace with the State of Israel  with secure borders for both. This will require a cessation of attacks on Israel from Gaza  withdrawal from all the occupied territories in the West Bank and the achievement of an agreement about the status of Jerusalem that would satisfy the parties directly involved and the entire international community.  On the situation in Lebanon  it is important for the international community to realize that a lasting peace in the region requires the establishment of a government of unity which can end the current political deadlock. If it is not resolved  this could lead to a return to civil war  which is something that we all thought was now over and done with.  From this rostrum  we join in the call for an immediate reduction in tension and peaceful solutions in all parts of the world where international peace and security are threatened. It is much less costly to invest our efforts in avoiding confrontation than to stop it once it has begun. Accordingly  we appeal to this Organization to reconsider its actions vis-à-vis the conflict in the Middle East which  far from being resolved  seems to be intensifying.  Turning to the dispute between Serbia and the Kosovar Albanians  today we can be cautiously optimistic that  after several months of Security Council debate  which included a visit to the region  the parties have agreed to resume dialogue. Only an agreement between them can ensure peace and economic development in the region.  Panama strongly supports the renewal and extension of the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. We recognize the progress made by the Haitian Government with support from that mission. However  there are many matters that still require more efforts  and it is essential that the mandate not end before that country’s institutions have been strengthened.  We welcome the progress made  but we must condemn the violation of human rights in Myanmar and the continued detention of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Although every conflict has its own particular causes  we can say that violations of the human rights of certain groups  a culture of impunity or the absence of strong institutions able to guarantee the human rights of all are the common denominator of most conflicts.  In Africa  there are examples of how institutional weakness and abuses of human rights become the main causes of conflict. On the initiative of the President of France  the Security Council is meeting this very afternoon to analyse all the problems that afflict that continent (see S/PV.5749). It is only by strengthening institutional capacity and building a culture of justice that it will be possible to restore to those peoples the rights that this Organization enshrined for all inhabitants of the Earth.  Responsibility for solving disputes and preventing conflict lies primarily with the States parties to a dispute. However  achieving peace depends to a large extent on our commitment to the collective security architecture that we have built here in the United Nations. Since the end of the cold war  the United Nations has responded to the major challenges to international peace and security by increasing the number and the quality of peacekeeping operations in cases where diplomacy has failed. To avoid a return to conflict situations  peacekeeping operations cannot be confined to simply separating rival forces. It is essential to strengthen the concept of integrated missions to include new responsibilities that cover a broader range of activities. Achieving a lasting peace means more than simply laying down one’s weapons. One must set off on the path towards development; legal and political institutions must be rebuilt and human rights must be respected.  We cannot talk about lasting peace while we live under the threat of terrorism  whose definitive defeat is an ongoing challenge for the international community. Panama supports United Nations efforts to combat this scourge in an integrated manner  such as the adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (see resolution 60/288). And  because we attach high priority to the adoption of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism  we have shouldered the responsibility of chairing the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee.  The adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (see resolution 61/106) was a major milestone on the path towards a world without exclusionism and reaffirmed the universality of human rights. Specific measures have been defined to guarantee full participation. Above all  we have categorically said that discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person. I would like to say that Panama has made significant progress in this area; inclusive education is a State priority. We have signed the Convention  and we are committed to implementing it.  Of particular importance to Panama is the recent adoption of a declaration on indigenous peoples for the Latin American region. It strengthens respect for cultural diversity  with emphasis on preserving cultural assets.  A year ago  I told the General Assembly (see A/61/PV.12) that my country would hold a referendum to decide whether to undertake the work of widening the Panama Canal so that larger ships could transit between the two great oceans. As I believe is generally known  the people of Panama approved the project  and barely three weeks ago the work began. It will be completed by the year 2014.  Panama  which has always contributed to the development of international trade and to understanding among nations  is especially pleased to reaffirm that unifying mission today  as well as its commitment to peace  development and full respect for human rights.  I should like to conclude my statement by referring to some words spoken from this same rostrum by a Panamanian more than 50 years ago and that are still just as true today. He said that to attempt to preserve peace without at the same time improving peoples’ living conditions is to leave the task unfinished and inconclusive. We should not tire of repeating that the most serious threats to peace and freedom are rooted in human poverty  social injustice  ignorance and economic backwardness; and that the only peace worth keeping and defending  and which can be lasting  is peace with honour  justice and freedom. "
"135",5544,"PER",62,2007,"For Peru  Sir  your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session is a guarantee of experience and exceptional work. I am convinced that your performance will strengthen the principles of dialogue and coordination that guide the efforts of the United Nations to attain realistic commitments that contribute to well-being in the daily life of humankind.  On 15 August  an earthquake occurred in the city of Pisco  seriously impacting the southern populations of Peru  claiming priceless human lives and causing great material damage. The Peruvian people deeply appreciates the immediate and generous response of the international community  as well as the speedy action of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The Office’s support showed that united action can make a difference in a crisis situation and contributed to the Government’s activities in attending to the urgent needs of the victims. Our sincere recognition goes to the cooperation received  which is now being channelled by my country’s Fund for Southern Reconstruction.  The stabilization and growth of the Peruvian economy over the past 76 months have generated national and international confidence and expectation. We are convinced that the investment and participation of our productive forces will allow us to maintain continuous growth and to exploit the opportunity to enhance a model and national project of social tranquillity and development.  In the first year of his Government  President of the Republic Alan García has laid the foundations for greater dynamic growth in the country. We must now consolidate and give practical and positive content to the democracy  governance and economic stabilization of the country in order to allow the growth indices to generate national confidence and participation that can be converted into transparency  equity  justice and social peace.  The struggle against poverty and inequity is the most formidable current challenge to the national and foreign policies of Peru. In the conviction that the dignity of human beings and their welfare are at the core of governmental management  and that economic indicators should be based on the well-being of our population without distinction  the Government of Peru has redefined its social policy through a concept of productive inclusion  access to education and technological innovations  territorial institutional development and support for the population. To that end  we have begun implementing a national strategy of rural development and a national strategy of food security to address chronic child malnutrition. Important road infrastructure works will complement the incorporation of the Peruvian Andes and Amazonia into the development of the country.  Towards the fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals  Peru has set itself the concrete goal of reducing the current level of poverty from 50 per cent to 30 per cent by 2011. Chronic malnutrition will be reduced from 25 per cent to 16 per cent  and the provision of potable water and electricity will be extended to 90 per cent of citizens. Likewise  we plan to eradicate illiteracy  reduce employment in the informal sector from 53 per cent to 35 per cent  create 1.5 million jobs  and reduce the external debt from 24 per cent to 13 per cent of the gross domestic product.   The Government’s new direction in State action is focused on decentralization. The strategic decentralization plan goes beyond the mere transfer of resources or the execution of public works in the interior of the country. The regions can now coordinate their own development plan  efficiently distribute more than 80 per cent of the national budget  interlink and gradually integrate Peru as a whole  and promote the better distribution of the population and income through a process of national institutionalization that supports optimal care of the environment.  Peru has become one of the emerging countries of the region thanks to the continuous growth of its economy over the past eight years. Its strategic location in the South American Pacific  the full force of a modern legal framework that encourages investment and exports  the diversity of its natural resources  its growing diversification in the global markets  and its political and macroeconomic stability are factors that ensure a development process of genuine social inclusion.  Much remains to do. In the face of the uncertainty of the Doha Round negotiations and a cautious evaluation of the effective possibilities of integration in the Andean subregion and Latin America  Peru is striving to conclude free trade treaties with its major commercial partners that will complement regional and subregional integration schemes and multilateral trade negotiations. In the Andean Community   comprised of Peru  Colombia  Ecuador and Bolivia   Peru has an up-to-date free-trade zone. Likewise  Peru has entered into free-trade treaties with Chile and the United States  and is negotiating similar instruments with Canada and Mexico. Negotiations with the Central American countries are scheduled to begin shortly. We have finished negotiating a free-trade agreement with Singapore  negotiations with Thailand have reached an “early harvest” agreement  and we have begun to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the People’s Republic of China. Likewise  the negotiation of an agreement of association between the Andean Community and the European Union has begun. Our priorities are now to pursue negotiations with Korea  Japan  India  Russia  Australia and New Zealand. Our objectives are clear: to ensure access to the markets of our main commercial partners; to establish fair and predictable commercial rules and regulations that complement the standards of the World Trade Organization; to diversify the markets for our exports of goods and services; and to attract investment and technologies to modernize our productive structure  reduce the technology gap  and modernize Peru’s physical infrastructure in order to increase its competitiveness.  Following on the results of a regressive utopian experiment in Latin America  we are convinced that Peru’s model of integration into the global economy  while consolidating regional economic expansion  will allow us to ensure the participation of the large majority of our people in the system’s benefits  with concrete improvements in their daily lives. It will thereby contribute to the people’s sense of belonging to their social institutions and of full citizenship  as well as to their perception of themselves as agents of social-economic change and to the consolidation of the democratic system.  In the framework of such integration  my country is also assuming growing international responsibilities. In our efforts to foment dialogue  we are deeply honoured to be able to organize a summit of heads of State and Government of Latin America and the Caribbean and the European Union  as well as the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum  both of which will take place in Peru in 2008.  Formidable technological advances  especially in the information field; the emergence of new powers; energy insecurity; climate change; growing inequity and poverty; and new challenges to international security characterize a changing and ever-more complex international scene to which States and international institutions must adapt. Global society is interlinked through productive processes  trade  financial flows  the digital telecommunications revolution  and so on.   In this complicated scenario  Peru is participating in the Security Council and in peacekeeping operations. The Peruvian armed forces are present in the Sudan  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Ethiopia and Eritrea  Liberia  Côte d’Ivoire and Haiti.  Peru attaches special importance to cooperation with Haiti  having assumed in January the coordination of the Group of Friends of Haiti in the Security Council. In that regard  we support the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) for a year  as well as the gradual reorientation of its work to promote development  in support of its multidisciplinary and multidimensional work. At present  we are contributing a contingent of Peruvian military officers  which we expect to be able to complement shortly with an engineering corps.  Our permanent representation in New York has presented a draft resolution that  inter alia  reaffirms the urgent call to fulfil the contribution pledges  pursuant to the priorities presented by the Haitian Government  especially for cooperation projects to eradicate poverty  improve basic health services and strengthen national institutions. We expect the draft resolution to enjoy consensus in the Security Council so that the international contribution to Haiti can continue.  Last May  Peru  with the cooperation of Norway and the United Nations Development Programme  organized the Lima Conference on Cluster Munitions  assuming a lead regional role in the endorsement of the Oslo Process. At the Conference  Peru presented to the 69 delegations of the participating countries a proposal to secure a declaration of the Latin-American region as a zone free of cluster munitions  which have indiscriminate effects on civilians. Our initiative already enjoys the support of many countries of our region.  Peru is also committed to effectively implementing the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Peru is in the final stages of preparing a national plan of action against anti-personnel mines with a view to completing the demining process along our northern frontier  in cooperation with the brotherly country of Ecuador.   Moreover  Peru is firmly committed to efforts to attain complete disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  as well as their delivery systems  which constitute a threat to international peace and security. In that respect  we support the strengthening and universalization of the relevant binding multilateral agreements. In that context  Peru organized a regional seminar on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) in November 2006  in which most countries of the region participated.  The General Assembly is the forum in which the middle-income countries can efficiently contribute to identifying imaginative responses to conflicts and new threats. That is why we resolutely support reform that will strengthen the Assembly and ensure its ability to adapt to change and to the most urgent needs on the international agenda. In order to reinforce the Assembly’s legitimacy  we need to sharpen procedures and reduce its agenda. An equal priority is to carry out more effective action against violations of human rights. Security Council reform is needed urgently to make the Council a more efficient  transparent  legitimate and representative body with better working methods. On the Other hand  we also want to highlight the validity of the Economic and Social Council  an essential instrument for promoting greater effectiveness in the coordination of development strategies  as well as assistance in emergencies.  International reality presents many challenges to the universal system for promoting and protecting human rights. There is still a dichotomy between security and individual rights  with a backdrop marked by the poverty and the inequality in which the great majority around the world live and which affect human dignity. The new Human Rights Council and the system integrated into it ought to help in the response to these challenges.   Discussion over the last few days in this Organization shows that climate change is a world problem that requires a collective response from the international community in a framework of a multilateral and worldwide commitment. Through sustainable forest management  Peru has contributed to the global commitment by reducing emissions caused by deforestation. We have also made headway in implementing our National Strategy on Climate Change by strengthening national capacities to maximize human and financial resources. The size of the problem requires an agreement with goals for the emission of greenhouse gases more ambitious than those agreed in the first stage. Peru has great expectations for the next meeting in Bali  and we will work to ensure a common platform that will allow us to very soon begin negotiations to define the new international regime that we hope will be concluded in 2009.  The official launching of the International Year of the Potato will take place at Headquarters on 19 October. This celebration is especially important for my country because the potato has its origin in Peru  and it is the country with the greatest genetic diversity of this product. The cultivation of the potato was developed in ancient times by civilizations that gave rise to the Peru of today and is one of the great contributions to the world’s diet. Peru has proclaimed 2008 as the National Year of the Potato and has developed a calendar of multisectoral activities for outreach and research that will be a positive contribution to the work programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization.  I shall conclude by noting that Peru participates actively to ensure and strengthen the United Nations Charter principles and objectives of peace  peaceful coexistence and development  especially in the Security Council and the Human Rights Council. In accordance with this commitment  Peru will continue to promote dialogue and coordination among peoples of the world. It has put forward its candidature for the Economic and Social Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  bodies within the United Nations system where we hope to achieve the support of all members of the Assembly in order to contribute to working towards a safer  more equitable world where development can reach the large majority of populations.

"136",5591,"PHL",62,2007,"Mr. President   congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly. Congratulations also to our Secretary-General  His Excellency Ban Ki-moon  who was such a good friend of the Philippines when he was Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea. We embrace his vow to focus on strengthening the three pillars of the United Nations: development  security and human rights.  The United Nations is a pillar of development. It plays a major large role for the Philippines. Poverty alleviation is the most important part of our agenda and our vision of transforming the Philippines into a modernized nation in 20 years. We want to be actively engaged in local  regional and global affairs  because that is the future.  We believe in the power of the global trading system to alleviate poverty and modernize nations through market forces. That does not mean we believe that countries like the Philippines are ready to compete head-to-head today in every sector  but it does mean that we cannot afford to be afraid of globalization.  By being increasingly connected to the world  the Philippine economy has reached a new level of maturity and stability  with some of the strongest macroeconomic fundamentals in 20 years. Six years ago  noone thought we could get more revenue  cut down on tax cheats  strengthen the peso and move the stock market. Noone thought we could bring our budget into balance  which we did last month  or prepay our debts and raise employment  but we have.  We must both grow our economy and sustain our natural environment at the same time. We are developing and promoting our “Green Philippines” agenda. It emphasizes a sustainable economic model that brings together economic opportunity and concern for our environment.  At the Secretary-General’s High-level Event on Climate Change earlier this week  United Nations member nations focused on what the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto Protocol meetings in Bali to be held in December 2007 should do. The Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol has allowed developing countries such as the Philippines to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions through private sector initiatives. But there is a need to expand the carbon market and to expand international cooperation and financial support to promote strategies to adapt to climate change.  Too many nations  both developed and developing  believe the environment must be sacrificed at the altar of growth. We believe otherwise. We believe that we have a unique opportunity to get it right from day one: to introduce new industries that are clean and profitable.   That includes a biofuels industry that helps our energy independence  creates jobs and keeps our nation clean for future generations. We are further developing our geothermal power  which is one of the two largest in the world.   We reiterate our commitment to the global trading system and  when that fails us  to strengthening the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and regional relations in order to bolster our economy.   The multilateral trading system  through the Doha Round  remains the best option to address poverty and improve standards of living around the world through an agreed set of international trade rules. The Doha Development Agenda was launched with an emphasis on creating a developmental dimension and integrating it into all elements of the negotiations. To make the Doha Round truly a development round  there must be a greater coherence of policies among international development institutions  such as the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Trade Organization  so that trade is mainstreamed in the development agenda and capacity-building can be focused on trade competitiveness.   As part of capacity-building  we call on the United Nations and our partners among developed nations to strengthen South-South cooperation  wherein developing nations with specific strengths can share with other developing nations in need of their strengths  funded by developed nations or multilaterals such as UNDP.   The developed nations were the prime movers of global trade when it suited them; now some countries are slowing things down. That is not right  nor is it good for our respective economies. But there has been a ray of hope  with the developed countries declaring that they are willing to maximize flexibilities in exchange for greater market access.   On the sidelines of the current session of the Assembly  we hope the contending countries can continue consulting to find the right formula of subsidy cuts and market access to break the Doha impasse.   But let us be clear: even as the Philippines works tirelessly to move the talks forward  we are not going to stand by and do nothing. For us  it is full speed ahead; preferably with Doha  but full speed nevertheless. We recognize that if the multilateral trading system is fragmented into trading blocs  it will result in a more complex set of trade rules. That could incompatible with and detrimental to the interests of developing nations. In the meantime  while we are hoping for a successful conclusion to the Doha Round  we have to maximize the economic opportunities provided under bilateral and regional free trade agreements. That will complement efforts under the multilateral trading system.   At a time of uncertainty  when the Doha Round is faltering  ASEAN has taken a bold step forward by drafting its Charter. That is our first step to creating a permanent sense of community. We are working towards a single market with free movement of goods  ideas and skilled talent.   In APEC  the world’s largest economy  the United States  and the world’s fastest-growing economy  China  are active participants. We have a strong alliance with the United States  which remains our largest trading partner and our strongest strategic ally. We have stood shoulder to shoulder for many generations. We expect to continue building on our mature relationship with the United States.   We have also forged a strong relationship with China. China’s rise is a significant opportunity for the Philippines. Our overall relations are now more confident and comprehensive.   Relations are not just about trade. They are also about people  and this includes migration  a worldwide reality. We thank the Secretary-General for supporting the Philippine hosting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development next year  and we invite all Member States to participate.   Overseas Filipino workers are honoured by the Government and the people for their sacrifice and dedication to work  family and nation. We welcome their contribution  but we are working towards the day when Filipinos no longer need to go abroad for a job  the day that overseas work is just another career option. We believe that our ambitious economic reforms will increasingly keep our best and brightest right in the Philippines  closer to friends and families  helping to build our communities and provide the next generation of leadership.   The United Nations is a pillar of security and human rights. It remains the central pillar underpinning conflict resolution. Our country is among the largest  if not the largest  contributor of police officers to United Nations peacekeeping missions. The Philippines has peacekeepers  both military and police  in Afghanistan  Côte d’Ivoire  Georgia  Haiti  Kosovo  Liberia  the Sudan and Timor-Leste. We will continue our participation to safeguard communities so that they may overcome conflict and regain the peace needed to pursue development.   Closer to home  I have personally advanced the process of peace in Muslim and Christian Mindanao to a new level of engagement  focusing on interfaith dialogue  economic development and mutual security. We have done so with the largest possible international involvement  including that of the United Nations. Peace in Mindanao is very much an issue of human rights  as is poverty alleviation  our number-one issue.   The Philippines is the most democratic country in our region. We have no tolerance for human rights violations at home or abroad. We support the effort to revitalize and refocus the work of the United Nations in human rights. For that reason  the Philippines sought and won a seat on the Human Rights Council.   The attention of the international community has been drawn  with great reason and justification  to the current situation in Myanmar. This is the time for Myanmar to return to the path of democracy  to release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi   now   and to involve all the parties  including the National League for Democracy  in the democratization and constitutional processes.   In conclusion  the number of globe-sized issues we will face in the twenty-first century will require globe-sized cooperation. We must build bridges of peace and prosperity  and the place to start is in building a stronger United Nations.  "
"137",5610,"PLW",62,2007,"On behalf of the President of Palau  Tommy E. Remengesau  Jr.  and the people of Palau  let me begin by offering my congratulations to the General Assembly President on his election and assuring him of our cooperation in the coming year. We express our appreciation to the Group of Asian States and the General Assembly for the confidence they have demonstrated by electing a representative of Palau as a Vice-President. Palau is the smallest country in the history of the United Nations to have this honour  and we take it very seriously.  Palau congratulates the Secretary-General on his leadership on stopping the genocide in Darfur. We were moved by the calls for immediate action that we heard from President Bush and others here at the United Nations. In this respect  I wish to announce that Palau will send peacekeepers to Darfur and will play our part in this critical demonstration of international concern.  Despite our capacity issues  this will not be Palau’s first peacekeeping deployment. But while we are a responsible and proud Member of the United Nations  we note the continuing lack of a permanent United Nations presence in Palau. Last June  the United Nations Development Programme  the United Nations Population Fund and UNICEF announced that eight new joint offices would open in Pacific island countries  including Palau. We welcomed that historic accomplishment  but we are concerned at the fact that the offices have yet to open. Existing mechanisms appear to have blocked progress on the ground. But we believe that the original goals and intentions of the project can be salvaged if there is a will to respond to the needs of small island nations like Palau. We would welcome the intervention and assistance of our partners  as well as the recommitment of the Secretariat to our original shared goals.  We note the President’s call to ensure that the United Nations as an organization and we as Member States are properly prepared to confront terrorism. Palau has worked to improve its anti-terrorism capacity. We have also met with the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate to advance our requests for assistance  particularly in the area of combating money-laundering and terrorism financing. Unfortunately  the efforts of the Directorate have been insufficient. Our hope is that during the sixty-second session of the General Assembly  the United Nations will be able to help small countries in addressing this threat and in meeting our Security Council obligations.  The Pacific is home to some of the world’s largest and most important biodiversity hotspots. Our ocean ecosystems provide the backbone for Palau’s existence  and we are committed to their preservation. Last year  our nations banded together to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems from deep-sea bottom trawling  a destructive fishing practice responsible for 95 per cent of worldwide damage to seamounts. As a result  the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization adopted interim measures that took a substantial step towards eliminating this unsustainable practice. We encourage all other regional fisheries management organizations and flag States to follow this example  and we remind them of the deadlines to take action.  Palau has been vocal in its crusade to end bottom trawling because of its effects on ocean ecosystems. The North Pacific is home to some of the world’s best fisheries. Their diversity is the key reason for the Micronesia Challenge  an initiative launched by President Remengesau  whereby countries and territories of Micronesia have joined together to conserve 30 per cent of near-shore marine resources and 20 per cent of land resources by the year 2020. This project is the first of its kind in the world. It covers 6.7 million square miles of ocean  and it will help protect 10 per cent of the world’s coral reefs  including more than 60 threatened species.  While eliminating bottom trawling and establishing protected areas are certainly important actions  they will be fruitless if rapid progress on climate change cannot be made at the international level. We are no longer in total control of our destiny. When temperatures increase  our corals bleach  the seas rise and the oceans acidify  threatening to demolish our marine biodiversity  jeopardizing our livelihoods and eventually destroying our identity.  In the light of the high vulnerability of small island developing States to the impact of climate change  we stress the absolute need to reach an agreement on a set of quantified emission reduction targets for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. These emission reduction targets must be ambitious  must reflect the urgency of our collective circumstances and must be consistent with a mitigation framework that protects the most vulnerable parties to the Convention  in both the short and the long-term. It is imperative that the effectiveness of the post-2012 regime address the issue of mitigating the impacts of climate change on small island developing States  as the key benchmark of its adequacy and effectiveness.   We note too the ongoing debate on General Assembly reform and join our voices with others who note the need for concrete results on Security Council reform. Without Security Council reform  there can be no genuine United Nations reform. The early conclusion of the discussion is essential. Japan has demonstrated its concern for and commitment to the Pacific and the international community. It should be a permanent member of the Security Council. That is true too of India  the largest democracy among developing nations  whose contributions to global security have earned it the right to a permanent seat on the Security Council. We have supported and continue to support the draft resolution of the Group of Four and hope that the Assembly will address the resolution this year.  We also note our disappointment that Taiwan continues to be excluded from this Hall. The world would benefit from Taiwan’s membership in the United Nations and other international institutions. We were disappointed that the Secretary-General failed to follow the Charter and the rules of the Security Council by refusing to transmit and circulate Taiwan’s membership application to the Security Council and the General Assembly. Ultimately  legitimate democracies must be recognized and supported across the breadth of our planet no matter how large or small the country.  On behalf of Palau  a small and peaceful island nation in the wide Pacific Ocean  let me thank all of you in my country’s native language: Kom Kmal Mesulang. "
"138",5651,"PNG",62,2007,"I wish  to express to Mr. Srgjan Kerim  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session  Papua New Guinea’s congratulations on his election. We assure him of my country’s full cooperation during his presidency. We compliment his predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her stewardship of our work during her tenure  and we wish her well in her future endeavours.  I would like to express our support to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his leadership of the United Nations. Let me thank him  in particular  for his courage and strong leadership on the issue of climate change. By the same token  I would also like to thank the staff of the Secretariat and all United Nations agencies who continue to give valuable service to my country  Papua New Guinea.  On 18 September 2007  two days after celebrating 32 years of independence  Papua New Guinea convened its eighth National Parliament. This was a result of another successful general election. Democracy is a challenge  but Papua New Guinea continues to thrive under it. My country of more than 800 tribes and languages continues to find in the democratic principles the binding force and unity in diversity in the 32 years of unbroken democracy.  Papua New Guinea remains committed to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. We agree with the President that we must continue to work with common purpose to renew  modernize and strengthen this Organization so it can rise to the challenges of the twenty-first century.  The increasing incidence of human atrocities  genocide and war  poverty  terrorism  HIV/AIDS  the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis  the proliferation of small arms and light weapons  drug and human smuggling  environmental degradation and climate change are issues that  we believe  the United Nations is best placed to address.  Again we agree with the President that global challenges demand multilateral solutions. The United Nations is the appropriate multilateral forum to take such action. That is why the revitalization of the General Assembly deserves our highest attention. To revitalize the Assembly is also to renew our faith in each other and in our common values and destiny.  We strongly endorse the President’s five priority issues of climate change  financing for development  achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  countering terrorism  and the United Nations reform agenda. To complement efforts in other forums  Papua New Guinea with other countries of the Pacific region has agreed to pool our limited resources under the Pacific Plan  in order to address  as the basis of our cooperation  many of these same issues  in particular  sustainable development  climatic change and regional integration.  Let me turn now to an issue which my country feels strongly about: climate change. To be clear  we are very concerned to see certain industrialized nations attempting to avoid responsibility for their own carbon emissions and shifting the focus to developing nations. Only after industrialized nations take responsibility for the consequences of their own actions will the pathway become clear for lasting solutions.  However  as developing countries  we are willing to contribute equitably towards a sustainable future. During my earlier statements at the high-level event on climate change  I put forward key principles needed to guide future international agreements on climate change after the year 2012.  The time for leadership is now. If we are to defeat this self-inflicted calamity  we must succeed in six key areas: we must construct a shared vision for lower global greenhouse gas concentrations; we must aggressively deepen reduction commitments by industrialized countries; we must create more mechanisms to provide positive incentives for developing countries; we must launch a global framework to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation; we must scale up adaptation financing for future generations; and we must mobilize sufficient and sustainable resources to support positive incentives and adaptation.  The science is clear. Our planet is in distress. As co-inhabitants of this world  we all must address the root causes of the problem. To succeed  leadership is required on both sides of the economic divide. Together  and only together  we can grasp the challenges before us and construct a sustainable future.  Papua New Guinea supports the ongoing reforms in the United Nations Secretariat. In order to strengthen it to better address some of the key challenges facing the membership  reform should reflect the geopolitical  economic and social realities of today  taking into particular account the different levels of development facing the membership. Above all  the reform must be fair and equitable.  Global trade today is uneven and characterized more by unfair trade practices by those already holding decided advantages than by the opportunities it offers to developing countries like Papua New Guinea. Our efforts to develop a more equitable trading order are hampered by the reluctance of our developed partners to open their economies and engage in genuine development discussions.  The Doha Round of negotiations are at a critical juncture. We need to collectively ensure that those negotiations are revived so that different trade needs of its members are addressed.  Papua New Guinea has moved forward from an export-driven economic growth strategy to a policy of economic consolidation and empowerment. Its core policy objective is to provide every Papua New Guinean equal opportunity to build home  community and country. To achieve this  strong emphasis will be placed on agriculture  which has always been the mainstay of our rural populace. Along with this aim  relevant infrastructure will be built to support that important sector.  The country’s five-year medium-term development strategy is being reviewed to strengthen its alignment with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Achieving the MDGs by 2015 is a challenge that requires our collective input in its implementation.  We call on development partners  including the United Nations  to play a supportive role in implementing and sustaining these activities. That can be done through fair trade opportunities  equitable markets  increased foreign investment  transfer of technology  capacity-building and providing quality overseas development assistance.  The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a serious threat to social and economic security in many of our countries. Greater efforts must be made to arrest it. In Papua New Guinea  my Government has passed HIV/AIDS legislation underpinned by a comprehensive HIV/AIDS policy framework. We consider HIV/AIDS to be a development issue and deal with it separately from other health issues. But our experience suggests that national action alone is not enough. A concerted global response is required. HIV/AIDS is a threat that must be addressed on all fronts and by all countries. We thank the United Nations and its related agencies for their efforts in addressing HIV/AIDS. We also thank former President of the United States  Mr. Bill Clinton  for his contribution to this work in my country.   Of equal importance are the battles against malaria  tuberculosis and other preventable diseases. While  as a global community  we have focused on HIV/AIDS and avian flu  little attention is given to malaria  which remains the biggest killer disease in my country. We therefore thank Mr. Bill Gates for assistance given to research work on malaria in Papua New Guinea. We call upon development partners to support Papua New Guinea and other countries in addressing these challenges.  Despite many United Nations resolutions  the conflict in the Middle East remains unresolved. Papua New Guinea appeals to all parties to the conflict  including those Powers that have the capacity to influence a positive outcome  to make the necessary concessions for a peaceful resolution to this long-standing issue. We appeal to all parties to make full use of the dispute-settlement procedures of the United Nations.  The work of the Special Committee on Decolonization remains unfinished. There are still 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories   some in the Pacific   that have yet to exercise their right to self-determination. The forthcoming referendum in Tokelau demonstrates once again the true spirit of cooperation between Tokelau and New Zealand. We congratulate both Governments and assure the people of Tokelau of our respect for their ultimate decision. In the same vein  we hope that other Administering Powers will follow the example of New Zealand and assist other territories reach a decision of their choice.  While our world today provides untold opportunities  we are at the same time faced with many complex challenges. We must renew our commitment to and faith in the United Nations and seek to reform it in ways that are reflective of the realities of today. Thirty-two years ago  when I brought my nation to take its seat in the General Assembly  I said  and wish to reaffirm today  that  within the limits of our resources  Papua New Guinea will play an active and positive role in the United Nations. That commitment remains. "
"139",5697,"POL",62,2007,"I wish to begin by conveying my respect and gratitude to Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  who presided over the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. I also sincerely congratulate her successor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  the newly elected President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.   The current session is the best proof that we live in a world of numerous contradictions and multiple approaches to the basic issues facing humankind today. We can say that what some people took to be obvious following the fall of communism in 1989  which came to be called the end of history in the academic world  was not borne out by reality. History is rife with such contradictions  which are linked above all to inequalities in economic development between various countries and regions. Echoes of those inequalities are heard every year in this Assembly Hall  and we have heard them today as well.  The problem is closely tied to an issue that has been discussed in the past few days in the course of the high-level event on climate change. I thank the Secretary-General for his initiative of convening that event. The topic of global warming is one of the key themes of this session. The problem can be considered from various perspectives.  First  as President Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic noted  the causes of global warming are not obvious. A debate is under way concerning those causes. In my country  some support the theory that climate change is not caused by human activities  but those people are in the minority. Most experts in the field claim that human economic activities  especially the generation of carbon dioxide  are the factors behind climate change  which has been dramatically described by many speakers over the past two days.  The problems and the efforts to resolve them are intrinsically linked to the contradictions of our world. When the first climate convention was adopted some 12 years ago  the developed countries were believed to be the main perpetrators of excessive carbon dioxide emissions  but much has changed since then. In many respects  we have observed changes for the better. Two of the largest countries on the planet  China and India  have begun to grow dynamically. That growth has clearly led to increased emissions to carbon dioxide  which contribute to climate warming.  How can we solve the problem? The 1997 Kyoto Protocol set out three methods  two of which would contribute most to limiting the carbon dioxide emissions of the highly developed countries  while the third alone promotes  to a certain degree  the mitigation of such emissions by the less developed. The results of the Kyoto Protocol have been significant  but they do not resolve every issue and the Protocol has not been ratified by every country. Many powerful States have failed to adopt it  but in any case it will no longer be in effect after 2012.  Thus  the world is facing a new challenge. On the one hand  as the representative of a developed country - though it is not among the most developed - I would stress that we cannot limit the less wealthy countries' right to development. On the other  we must make progress towards resolving the problems under discussion. We must therefore consider the best way to achieve progress.  I agree with those who claim  regardless of the countries they represent  that the problem cannot be resolved exclusively by methods linked to the pursuit of profit and the treatment of all goods as commodities - in other words  by the application of purely economic instruments. The market economy is the most efficient means of achieving economic growth and generating welfare  as attested by the failure of the communist system. However  market rules cannot be the sole principle governing not only the economy  but also social life and international relations. In that regard  as I did last year  I call for a much higher degree of solidarity. Without far-reaching assistance from the highly developed countries to countries that are rapidly developing or hoping to grow faster  there is no possibility of success.  What should such assistance consist of? Well  first of all  the transmission of technologies that contribute to mitigating emissions. Does the world now have regional organizations that would provide for the transfer of resources from country to country on a major scale? Yes  indeed. We have such countries and organizations  for instance  the European Union (EU)  which serves as evidence of the existence of such frameworks. Of course  the EU deals with general development and the protection against climate change  but  in this regard  it can serve as an example. It is an example that needs to be globally followed  where applicable. The question is who can be the agent organizing such international solidarity? The experience of the past sixty years shows that there is only one such organization  the one in which we are debating today  the United Nations.  But in order to achieve that objective  the United Nations must be significantly reformed. Poland has consistently advocated such reform. The main idea of the reform consists of the simple adaptation of the structure of the United Nations system to the fundamental changes in the political geography of the globe over the past sixty-two years. This is intrinsically linked to the reform of the Security Council.   In conclusion  I would like to mention some experiences of my country  similar to those of the Czech Republic  represented here today by Mr. Klaus. We recently did away with Communism. Since then  we have achieved economic success and  on the way  we have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent. Therefore  we see that it is  indeed  feasible to do so. Despite apparent obstacles  the problem is not insurmountable.   So  what methods can be applied? On the one hand  certain types of production should be stopped. On the other hand  we can develop forestation of the land. In Poland and in other countries  this approach can generate fantastic results. But  to achieve this  forests must be under general public control. I represent a country that operates on the basis of a market economy  but forests are a public resource.  Some years ago  the problem area we are discussing today was one of the essential but not predominant issues. Today  it is a key subject in debate in the European Union. Today it is also a theme raised by the United Nations. I believe there are reasons behind this. Therefore  this subject matter needs to be pursued further. "
"140",5723,"PRK",62,2007,"On behalf of the  delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  I should like at the outset to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am confident that your able leadership will ensure the success of our work.  I wish to begin my statement by reiterating the principled and just position of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and to emphasize its sincere effort to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  which continues to draw the attention of the international community. That issue  as has been made clear time and again from this very rostrum  is no more than a product of the deep-rooted and hostile policy of the United States towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea   a policy that has lasted for more than half a century.  Peace and stability on the Korean peninsula is directly linked to the peace and security of the North-East Asian region and of the world as a whole. It is regrettable  however  that there has never been lasting peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. Rather  there has been a recurring cycle of tension and détente whose principal cause is nothing other than the current  hostile relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States.  As history has proved  no issue can be resolved by resorting to sanctions and pressure. There has been no other option for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea   whose territory and population are small   but to strengthen its military power for self-defence  on the basis of Songun politics  to protect its national sovereignty and dignity in the face of the United States’ threats of nuclear strikes and harsh economic sanctions.   It is the Songun politics of the respected General Kim Jong Il and our active efforts that guarantee peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and a strategic balance in the North-East Asian region. Our Songun politics is a source of great pride and self-confidence for us  because it deters military conflict and ensures peace on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia.   Our national military power has a self-defensive nature  since it is intended solely to safeguard our sovereignty and to fulfil the aspirations of the countries in the region for peace  security and stability.  Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was the lifelong teaching of our fatherly leader President Kim Il Sung  and it has been our consistent position that the nuclear issue must be resolved peacefully through dialogue and negotiation. Thanks to our sincere efforts  several rounds of the Six-Party Talks have been held to date. That made possible the adoption of Joint Statement of 19 September 2005  followed by the  13 February 2007 agreement on initial actions to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. The Joint Statement sets out the obligations of all parties in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula on the basis of the principle of words for words and actions for actions. Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not lead to our unilateral disarmament  but can be achieved by ending the hostile relations between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States and by eliminating all nuclear threats on the Korean peninsula and in the surrounding region.  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea suspended the operation of the Nyongbyon nuclear facilities and allowed monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency  thus fulfilling its obligations under the 13 February agreement in a sincere manner. The Nyongbyon nuclear facilities are the parent body of our independent nuclear power industry  built with tremendous human and material resources. Accordingly  it is a courageous political decision to halt their operation and now pass to the stage of disabling them prior to eventual dismantlement.  As we clarified again at the Six-party Talks recently held in Beijing  the successful implementation of the 19 September Joint Statement requires all parties to fulfil their respective obligations in accordance with the principle of “actions for actions”. Specifically  it depends on what practical measures the United States and Japan will take to end their hostile policies towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The United States should take steps to change its policy towards my country and to normalize bilateral relations  while Japan should make a clean break with its past policy of aggression and crimes and set aside its hostility towards my country  as it has pledged to do. We will watch closely every move on the part of the United States and Japan at this stage  the stage that requires actions.  Nothing is more urgent or important than the reunification of the nation  which has had to live with a territorial division imposed by outside forces for more than half a century. Ever since the early days of the division  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has consistently sought to reunify the nation through independent dialogue and negotiations between the north and south of Korea  as it sees reunification as the supreme national task. The historic North-South Joint Declaration of 15 June 2000  a declaration of national independence and peaceful reunification  sought to achieve reunification through concerted efforts in accordance with the ideal of “by our nation itself”  thereby rejecting interference from outside forces.   The north-south summit now under way in Pyongyang opens a significant new phase that augurs well for peace  joint prosperity and reunification  taking Korean relations to a higher level  in accordance with the historic Joint Declaration and the spirit of “our nation itself”. With the north and the south sitting face to face in a spirit of national independence and love for country  all problems can surely be resolved in the interests of our nation  regardless of differences in ideas and systems.  In order for the objectives of the North-South Joint Declaration to be achieved and for peace and reunification to return to the Korean peninsula  the United States policy of hostility towards our country  and its interference in our nation’s internal affairs  should be brought to an end. In any case  the Government of our Republic will make every effort to bring about national reunification as soon as possible by emphasizing the concept of one nation  defending peace  realizing unity under the ideal of “by our nation itself”  and upholding the banner of the North-South Joint Declaration.  I would also like to draw the Assembly's attention to Japan’s recent attempt to use militarization to cast a dark shadow across the future development of the Korean peninsula and its neighbours. In addition  Japan’s discriminatory and repressive acts deny the national rights of Koreans in Japan  in violation of international law.   Japan's recent manoeuvres against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon)  have driven relations between Japan and our country to the lowest possible level. In an open challenge to the international community’s denunciation and condemnation of Japan’s treatment of Koreans  Japanese authorities have not hesitated to distort history  even going so far as to try to conceal Japan’s bloody past crimes  while turning the “self-defence force” into a regular army with a mandate that permits pre-emptive strikes against other countries by changing the “Peace Constitution” into a war constitution.  Indeed  Japan's attempt to eliminate by force the Chongryon  the legitimate overseas organization of compatriots from my country  constitutes an infringement of the sovereignty of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as serious as any financial sanction could be and a massive human rights violation according to the provisions of existing international human rights instruments.   We therefore hope that Japan will truly follow the path of friendship and peace rather than revive its unsavoury past. Unless it makes a clean break with its past crimes  Japan is not entitled to a future.   Although the first decade of the new millennium is already nearing its end  our planet has yet to be peaceful  even for a day. Indeed  world peace and security are now confronted with serious challenges of ever-increasing intensity. Principles of respect for national sovereignty and equality   the foundation of modern international relations   are threatened by attempts to extend and expand the “war against terrorism” for self-serving reasons  and by the high-handedness and arbitrariness of forces that advocate pre-emptive nuclear strikes and accelerated the modernization of nuclear weapons.  The present international situation requires the United Nations to strengthen its central role and functions in resolving such issues as global peace and security and sustainable economic and social development  in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Unilateralism and high-handedness should never be tolerated  as they violate principles of international law and the Charter  as well as collective efforts to build a new and just world order  based on respect for sovereignty  territorial integrity  equality and mutual benefit.  Disputes should be resolved peacefully through dialogue and negotiations. Collective sanctions and the use of force in the form of armed aggression against sovereign States must never be tolerated on any account.  The Security Council should be a responsible organ that truly ensures international peace and security. It should not be used by certain countries to promote their own strategic interests.  The peaceful and prosperous new world desired by humankind must have as its basis fair international relations in which the sovereignty of all States Members of the United Nations is respected without differentiation and the principles of equality and mutual benefit are observed.  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will continue to strive for the creation of a just and equal world order based on the ideals of independence  peace and friendship. "
"141",5768,"PRT",62,2007,"I have the  honour to address this General Assembly on behalf of the European Union.  I would like to start  Mr. President  by wishing you all the best in the mandate you are beginning. I would like you to know that you can count on the firm support of the European Union (EU) throughout this General Assembly  certain that you will continue the excellent work of your predecessor  Ms. Haya Al-Khalifa  whom I would also like to congratulate.  Since this is the first session of the General Assembly to be convened since our Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  assumed office  I also wish to take this opportunity  on behalf of the EU  to renew our solid support to him in his leadership of the United Nations.  In this globalized and interdependent world in which we live  only strong multilateral institutions can promote the fundamental values of peace  democracy  human rights and development. This is why the EU supports the primacy of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security as the foundation and focal point of our shared ambitions and concerted efforts. And that is why we adopted effective multilateralism and a rules-based international order as the objective of the European security strategy.  Let me make this clear: if the new century has taught us only one lesson  it is that global challenges require global responses. What is needed is effective multilateralism. That is what we are engaged in here at the United Nations  and that is what we are seeking to promote in the United Nations. The message that I wish to leave with members today  on behalf of the EU  is that they can rely on us to make effective multilateralism a reality  today.  I propose to begin with what is undoubtedly one of the greatest objectives that we in the United Nations have so far set for ourselves  which is to meet the internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Those goals are demanding  but they should not discourage us; on the contrary  they should inspire us to accelerate our work and enhance its effectiveness in eradicating poverty  building a true partnership for development  promoting education for all and decent health standards and combating climate change.  In that context  I must mention one of the stated objectives of the European Union: the adoption of a joint EU-Africa strategy to be endorsed by the second EU-Africa summit  to be held in Lisbon in December. I mention that objective because it is a clear sign of our times: a strategy  defined jointly by Africans and Europeans  that reflects our commitment to the MDGs and is in keeping with the activities of both continents’ multilateral institutions. It is an inclusive and ambitious strategy that reflects the progress made in Euro-African cooperation in a broad range of areas and sets standards to be met through shared responses to the challenges likewise shared by the continents of Africa and Europe.  Climate change is one of the great global challenges facing humanity today. It threatens our prosperity and could undermine our ability to achieve the MDGs. Here  too  our response must be global and collective.   I was pleased to take part in the high-level event on climate change. Its results are encouraging and give rise to optimism. They clearly show a political will to move forward. Sustainable development and emission reductions must go hand in hand; therefore  they are our shared responsibility. This initiative will add momentum to the formulation of a post-2012 global comprehensive agreement on a climate regime. I believe that we should agree to begin negotiations on such a regime at the Bali climate change conference  to be held in December. I wish to make it absolutely clear that the EU will make every effort to achieve an ambitious and solid international consensus at the conference.  Even more important  however  we need everyone’s support. The EU has already unilaterally committed itself to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 per cent. But we want to go further  and we are prepared to do so. That is why we announced that  as part of a future global agreement on climate rules  we would increase that commitment to 30 per cent. Here  I would like to reiterate our call for global emissions to be reduced by at least 50 per cent of their 1990 levels by 2050. I believe that by undertaking those commitments  the EU is sending a clear signal that it wishes to lead these global efforts.  I also wish to say something about reform of the institutional framework for United Nations environmental efforts. The EU firmly believes that ambitious reform is required if we are to achieve real change. In that context  the EU is in favour of transforming the United Nations Environment Programme into a specialized agency   a United Nations Environment Organization   because we believe it is essential to take heed of international public opinion.   Sustainable development also involves respecting  protecting and fulfilling human rights throughout the world. We believe that that is crucial and that it must remain at the centre of all United Nations sectoral activities. The General Assembly’s Third Committee should continue to play a central role in promoting and protecting human rights throughout the world. At the present session  the EU will do its utmost  as it has in the past  to ensure the Committee’s success.   Here  I should like to say to the members of the General Assembly that the EU is following closely the situation in Myanmar. We express our solidarity with the people of that country and call on its authorities to respect human rights. In particular  we call on them to refrain from using any form of violence against people who are engaged in peaceful protest. The authorities must endeavour to promote a genuine process of political reconciliation  because that is what democracy and respect for human rights require.   I wish to reaffirm the EU’s long-standing opposition to the death penalty and to reiterate once again our appeal for its total abolition throughout the world. In that regard  the EU will  together with countries from every region of the world  formulate a draft resolution on a universal moratorium on  and abolition of  the death penalty.  Effective multilateralism also requires a concerted response to the ever-widening range of threats to international peace and security.   We welcome the establishment of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur so that we can jointly contribute to the political resolution of that conflict  which has had tragic humanitarian consequences in the Sudan and the entire region. In order to address those consequences  the European Union reaffirms its support for the deployment of a multidimensional presence in eastern Chad and the northern Central African Republic and welcomes the opening of political talks on Darfur  which will take place in Libya on 27 October.  But peace and security are also a challenge in Europe. We share the opinion of the Secretary-General that the status quo in Kosovo is not sustainable. For that reason  the European Union supports and participates actively in the ongoing efforts of the international community  namely those of the Troika  to bring the parties closer together and obtain a comprehensive political solution that will lead to a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo and will contribute to the consolidation of stability and prosperity in that part of Europe: the Balkans. We urge both parties to engage constructively and creatively in that process. The European Union stands ready to play a significant role in the implementation of a future status settlement at the end of the negotiations.  The reactivation of the Middle East peace process remains a priority for the international community. We have to act quickly  because the door is open at the moment  but it will not stay open for long. The European Union  as a member of the Quartet  reiterates its commitment to reaching a just  comprehensive and lasting solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict. That can happen only through the creation of an independent  democratic and viable Palestinian State living side by side with Israel in peace and security.  The stabilization of Lebanon will also contribute to the stabilization of the Middle East. Resolving the present political crisis requires a special commitment and dialogue by Lebanon’s leaders and the countries of the region. For its part  the European Union is committed to ensuring Lebanon’s sovereignty  independence  unity and territorial integrity.  In the same manner  the European Union continues to support the promotion of peace  stability and prosperity in Afghanistan and the wider region.   All terrorist acts are criminal and unjustifiable  regardless of their motivation  their form or their manifestation. We must therefore make resolute efforts to counter terrorism  but that must be done in accordance with our obligations under international law  while fully respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms  the protection of which are essential in tackling the threat of terrorism.  I wish to say a word  from the standpoint of Europe  about the Alliance of Civilizations. It is an important and timely initiative that seeks to strengthen dialogue among peoples  cultures and religions. The European Union supports the appointment of former Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio to the post of High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations and welcomes his action plan. I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the commitment of the Group of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations  for which we ask for everyone’s support.  For centuries  international trade has been the main means of bringing different cultures and peoples together. That is why we also call for the earliest possible agreement in the World Trade Organization’s Doha Development Round. This month will be absolutely crucial for the Doha Development Agenda. Therefore  it is vital for all key members to show a spirit of compromise and constructiveness and the genuine will to commit to a fair and balanced agreement that can bring greater wealth for all.  Peace must be consolidated; failing this  it can be no more than the interval between wars. One of the newest Members of the United Nations is an example of that. I am referring to Timor-Leste  which  thanks to the efforts and commitment of the international community to consolidate the foundations of its statehood  its democracy and its development  recently successfully held its first independently organized elections. But  notwithstanding that success   which is enormous   the presence of all players continues to be required  to ensure the country’s political  economic and social stability.  We believe and wish to make it clear  here  beyond all doubt that the only possible response to the challenges of our times lies in effective multilateralism based on the United Nations system. For that reason we remain committed to the reform of its main bodies in order to enhance the Organization’s representivity  transparency and effectiveness.  Political will is needed in order to adapt our international system to the challenges we face today. The General Assembly and the Secretary-General can  rely on the European Union to help turn that political will into action. The response to those challenges lies in active and effective multilateralism. For all of us  it lies in the United Nations and in support for the Organization. That is the final message I wish to convey to the General Assembly on behalf of the European Union. "
"142",5814,"PRY",62,2007,"The  Government of Paraguay comes to the Assembly to reaffirm its importance in examining the world situation. We have also come in order to further strengthen the United Nations as a body fit to represent the interests of all countries and ensure the effectiveness of international law.  For that reason  Sir  I express my support for your successful presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. It is urgent for us to contribute not only to meeting the objectives of the United Nations  but also to ensuring that the principles governing its functioning truly find expression. The world needs a better  more just and brotherly world order now.  From this lofty universal rostrum  we customarily speak with eloquent urgency  but the practice of States  in particular of the most powerful  has not always been one of cooperating in order to overcome the uncertainties that overshadow our future.   In recent sessions of the Assembly  we have focused on the challenges of the new millennium  but while we have been looking far ahead  in the first decade of this new century alone  relations among civilizations have clearly been marred by an absence of peace and harmony.   It has not mattered that more than half of the world’s population continues to live in poverty. Of greater importance has been the senseless squandering of money on weapons and the terrible effect this has had on the world economy. Note how the price of oil has rapidly increased and how countries  such as ours  which do not produce oil  have had to make great sacrifices. How much money could have been used to alleviate poverty! As long as capital is concentrated in one area and poverty continues to rise  world peace will be precarious.   In Paraguay  in South America  we are calling for the globalization of democracy combined with social development. We are calling for the universalization of security based on respect for human rights and on the dignity of human life.  In this way we hope to build a regional community and a global union  which will work together to eradicate hunger and extreme poverty  and which will effectively cooperate to promote the participation of all in prosperity by providing quality education and a system of social protection without exclusion.   In Paraguay  we are struggling for economic stability  for political stability and for social peace. With these ideals  I have been working very hard at the head of the Government to make significant changes and score important advances. We have sought radical change beyond what is needed by the Paraguayan society. The achievements we have attained require that we continue the progressive policy to which we committed ourselves when we assumed office.  Since we took office in 2003  following a turbulent transition that was constantly undermined by violence and conspiracy  Paraguay has institutionalized political stability   not an easy task in an environment of political division and with a parliament that did not always meet its responsibilities in governing jointly. Nevertheless  political stability has been  and continues to be  one of the defining characteristics of our Government. Through great perseverance  we have succeeded in permanently institutionalizing political stability. We did so because I understood that stability had to be the framework for achieving economic development  which is so crucial to achieving our plans for incremental growth. Having achieved economic stability  we began a process of growth of historic proportions. After 20 years  Paraguay was able to overcome stagnation. Despite the terrible drought in the country  which continues to this day  Paraguay experienced an average annual rate of economic growth of 4 per cent for the period 2003-2007.  Moreover  my country has also recorded a budgetary surplus. We have also markedly improved our tax receipts and are waging a difficult battle to control inflation. Through that policy  not only have we considerably increased our financial reserves  which have tripled  but for the first time in its history Paraguay is today able to pay its foreign debt in full and still continue to hold international reserves. Our exports are at a historical high  having doubled during my term of office. Another relevant factor has been the sustained growth in per capita production  which will rise from $915 to $1 800 by the end of my mandate  in 2008.   More generally  the Government has been pursuing plans aimed at strengthening various areas of the economy  including the industrial  commercial and service sectors. We have encouraged the transformation of the country’s economy while coordinating and integrating the various sectors of production and facilitating the distribution  circulation and consumption of domestically produced goods. We have thereby been able to lower the rate of poverty we inherited from previous Governments   which is now approaching 38 per cent  down from the 46 per cent at which it stood in 2003.  However  the poverty and marginalization of millions of our fellow citizens continues to be the most obvious threat to democracy and political stability in Paraguay as well as the region. Our belief that we will continue to overcome poverty is due to the Government’s significant investment in society. Never before have so many houses been built nor more resources devoted to the most vulnerable members of our society. Next year  we will earmark 50 per cent of the country’s budget for the fight to reduce poverty.   As a multi-ethnic country  we have not ignored the education of our indigenous citizens. We have built schools and established special programmes. As a bilingual country  we have both ensured Guaraní-language education at all levels and worked towards having it recognized as a third official language of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR). Prior to the establishment of present-day borders  Guaraní was also spoken in Argentina  Brazil  Uruguay and Bolivia.  The Government over which I preside has ensured unfettered political freedom  as well as freedom of the press  association and expression. Unfortunately  the media have not always taken advantage of the freedom of the press in order to become channels for truthful information  serious and responsible opinion and constructive and reasoned criticism   much less to overcome its vestigial Manichaeism and instead to become a source of culture and daily provider of knowledge and ethical values.  Political parties are independent and represented in the parliament. Those not in parliament exercise their rights freely as new political parties are formed.   There is in fact pluralism in Paraguay  although the absence of an adequate civic culture on the part of most political actors has kept it from genuinely contributing to the essential consensus needed to defend the country’s overall interests and promoting equitable development within it. Unfortunately  remnants of fascism and conservatism continue to hamper coexistence in an environment of diversity and difference  while also conspiring against the country’s progress.  Nevertheless  our struggle for a participatory and inclusive democracy that promotes social justice has transformed the governing party. Today’s governing party is promoting an advanced philosophy of social change. It is also the political organization generating renewal and social mobilization to overcome the old party-based oligarchy that was so damaging to Paraguay. The party has therefore assumed responsibility for transforming the system whereby the State and its policies were subjugated to individual interests. Through its political independence  the party is in a position to able to eliminate illegitimate privileges and the illicit groups that control the economy  finances and large land holdings.   We are continuing to modernize Paraguay by linking the entire country with roads  exponentially expanding its economy and ensuring that all citizens become part of the nation’s social capital and possess the qualities and competitiveness required by today’s societies. Most of the people of Paraguay understand that the historic steps we have taken in that direction must continue and become irreversible. Today  anarchy  demagoguery and theological feudalism pose a regressive threat to peace  the secular State  the rule of law and the institutional order we are building.  Paraguay is the most open and dynamic country with regard to the regional integration agenda. Our support for MERCOSUR is a clear reflection of our national policy. We believe in MERCOSUR. We believe in regional integration. We believe in the possibility of Latin America having a louder voice in the world in order to manage and humanize the process of globalization.  My Government also endorses and supports the proposed union of South American nations  which will above all make us stronger in claiming and defending our rights in an environment of asymmetrical globalization and better able to contribute to world peace and more equitable distribution of international trade and financing for development.   The international mobilization of financial and technological resources is today threatening the stability and overall progress of countries. Speculative investments flow to countries and regions where the work force is subjected to exploitation. Then comes the invasion; and  through unfair competition  our industries are damaged and shut down. At the same time  our raw materials are undervalued. What capital should do is to promote industrialization  or at least ensure that the terms of trade become fairer instead of being imposed unilaterally.  We have to change this trend. The international economic order should promote a more equitable world economy. Through solidarity  cooperation and fair treatment  all countries of the world should be admitted into the club of development. In Latin America  and in Paraguay  we don’t need charity; we need markets  transparency  technology  and the lifting of protective trade barriers.   The United Nations should reflect this philosophy. For this reason  its reform cannot be delayed any longer. Its priority concerns should not be war  armed conflict or even terrorism  whether real or strategic. On the contrary  its priorities should be programmes to end poverty  ignorance and unemployment. We must educate and distribute in order to build a culture of democratic participation in the wealth of humanity.  Paraguay  like the other 30 landlocked developing countries  continues to suffer marginalization and a lack of proper access to international markets. The absence of preferential treatment for us from the more developed economies has denied us a more competitive participation in trade  as well as  access to quotas and to higher tariffs.  Paraguay is not only aware of the serious consequences of climate change; it also suffers from them. Proof of this is the catastrophe our country is suffering through prolonged drought and the dreadful fires that have destroyed a major part of our territory. I take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude on behalf of my people and my Government to the countries that have come to our aid in this national emergency. In particular  I would like to thank  from this rostrum  my friend Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  President of Brazil  Nestor Kirchner  President of Argentina  my friend President Chavez of Venezuela  and the other heads of Government and multilateral organizations that have worked with us.  Paraguay recognizes the importance of including gender issues in the agenda of the United Nations and the need for effective coordination among all agencies and organs in the United Nations system in addressing the situation of women in the world  particularly in developing countries. Increasingly and emphatically  we reject existing inequalities between men and women whether they be political  economic  social or cultural. Irrespective of the domestic actions we take to combat discrimination  we believe that the United Nations is the most appropriate forum for designing programmes in support of national policies to bring about true equality.   The Government of Paraguay would also like to take this opportunity to express once again for its support for the request for admission into the United Nations of the Republic of China  Taiwan  a nation that has continued to struggle for its freedom and wishes to be a member of the United Nations in accordance with Rules 59 and 60 of the Provisional Rules of the Security Council and Article 4 of the United Nations Charter.  In conclusion  inequalities among our peoples are not part of the human condition. On the contrary  they are the result of iniquitous relations that separate us and draw us apart. That being the case  we need only to show determination in building a universal community marked by greater equanimity and balance. This determination should be given expression by governments and citizens and should draw on the concerted efforts of States and civil society.   What we are seeing  however  is that the countries that have most want more. Their humanism is disguised in hand-outs and philanthropy when what the world needs is greater solidarity and justice. We need to share science and technology; we need to share markets. The pretence of cooperation to help countries achieve balanced development is not only denounced in fruitless rhetoric; it is also exposed in protectionism and in investment choices.  As long as this bipolar situation continues to prevail in the world  an organization such as the United Nations serves little purpose. Only when the powerful countries stop taking advantage of the less powerful countries will the United Nations be able to have a true impact on the lives of people.  This alternative is the process that we are involved in today. Many Governments representing countries in the Third World have begun to seek our own freedom. We are drawing a new map on the international scene.   I am compelled to mention this historic challenge in my final statement to the General Assembly of the United Nations because on 15 August 2008  I will hand over power to the new Government in my country. But I will continue to fight with greater fervour to help change the world. I am committed as ever to the difficult struggle to build a new world order  to ensure equality  social justice and solidarity for all countries  for all women and for all men. I will fight for their emancipation and their progress. "
"143",5833,"PSE",62,2007,"It is a  pleasure  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the Assembly at this session. We have every hope that your efforts will be successful. It is also a pleasure for me to convey our appreciation and pride to Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for the tremendous effort she undertook as President of the General Assembly at the sixty-first session.  I would like to take this opportunity to express our full confidence in the role of the United Nations and all of its specialized agencies with respect to their historic responsibilities regarding the Palestinian question  responsibilities they will continue to bear until this question is comprehensively settled. For many decades  those institutions have continued to reaffirm the established national rights of the Palestinian people and to provide varied support for our people  in the political  economic and humanitarian realms. Here  we must commend the exceptional ongoing work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and other institutions in safeguarding the future for generations of Palestinian refugees and providing them with the basic services they need. Our appreciation goes also to those who have upheld the basic human rights of the Palestinian people and who have provided support in the areas of education and culture and in strengthening the role of the Palestinian Authority since its inception  as well as in building and strengthening our national institutions.  I would like also to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who has given top priority to the Palestinian question  who has worked to reach a solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict and who has placed this matter at the centre of his concerns. He has  in addition  creatively contributed to seeking the means to relaunch the Middle East peace process.  The confrontations  wars and conflicts in our region and their tragic repercussions for the peoples of the region constitute the primary threat to global peace. They call all of mankind to awareness. They demand rapid intervention from the international community with the aim of settling this situation boldly and without delay. Our experience over the years and decades shows that the policy of delaying a settlement of the principal conflicts in the region  the policy of providing partial solutions and the policy aimed at containing the conflict by limiting the damage only further complicate things  to the point where  today  there is a clear threat of civil war or regional war. Moreover this climate has been conducive to terrorism  which unfortunately has spread to become a global phenomenon.  However  this grim picture should not mask the fact that hope is still alive. Indeed  thanks to the determination of the vast majority of our people  and thanks to the support of the international community  our people are capable of overcoming the tragic situation that we are being pushed into by the forces of occupation  extremism and aggression and  by those who seek to provoke war and terrorism in our region.  There are on the other hand responsible  active forces in the Middle East  representing the consciousness of the people and possessing a true desire for freedom  progress and democracy for the people. Although these forces are working in extreme difficulty  they are firmly committed to overcoming the current situation in order to create a  new future for the Middle East in which our peoples would enjoy freedom and equality.  There can be no doubt that defending Islam   a religion of moderation  of love and brotherhood; a human religion   is the responsibility of those active forces in our region who seek to counter any attempt to undermine that true religion or to portray it in an unfair manner that is entirely out of keeping with its precepts. Islam is a religion of tolerance that opposes killing  terrorism and assassination. It is a religion of enlightenment  not ignorance or backwardness; a religion of openness to the world. It is against extremism and close-mindedness. We need to work hand in hand to preserve our shared human values.  Those values are today being violated  undermined and weakened. We need to work to strengthen human understanding among religions and cultures because the attempt to foment conflict among religions  cultures and civilizations is one of the most dangerous methods used by international terrorism today.  That is why a dialogue among cultures  religions and civilizations is necessary today  particularly because we know that world wars have not been wars of religion or culture  but rather wars of interest. That reality is only one fragment of the overall picture. In fact  missing recurrent opportunities to address the issues of our region seriously so as to reach bold  comprehensive solutions  in particular to the Palestinian question  moves our people to the precipice of despair and depression and makes them easy prey to the forces of ignorance and fanaticism.   Is it not high time to take this opportunity  the beginnings of which we see today  as the international community is moving towards relaunching the peace process  which enjoys the support not only of Israelis and Palestinians  but also of the international community and the world at large? Is it not time to move seriously towards negotiating a complete end to the 1967 Israeli occupation of Arab and Palestinian territories  thereby achieving the vision of two States? Is it not time to create a Palestinian State  with East Jerusalem as its capital  to settle the refugee issue and to put an end to six decades of suffering? Is it not time to reach a fair  agreed settlement under General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 1948? Is it not time to end the policies of settlement expansionism  of taking land from Palestinians under various pretexts  of building the apartheid separation wall  laying siege and creating checkpoints around cities and towns and refugee camps? Is it not time to end the policy of collective punishment and of denying freedom to the more than 11 300 Palestinians who are rotting in Israeli prisons  some for more than 25 years?   Is it not time to make Jerusalem a city of peace for all faiths and religions? Is it not time for Israel  the occupying Power  to end any work that would change the sacred nature of that city and all attempts to displace its inhabitants and to violate sites sacred to Islam and Christianity? Is it not time for Israel to end the daily assassinations  displacements  destruction of houses and seizure of land? Is it not time for our people to be able to enjoy freedom and independence on equal footing with all other peoples of the world so that they can build a peaceful future together with all of their neighbours  including the State of Israel?   I hope that I will not have to come back to this rostrum next year to ask the same questions.   There is not the slightest obstacle to the successful holding of the upcoming peace conference  because our brotherly  Arab countries have demonstrated through the Arab Peace Initiative their true readiness to bring about a just  lasting and comprehensive peace  from which all States of the region would benefit. Those States would have normal relations with Israel  once the Israeli occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories had ended and an independent  sovereign Palestinian State had been created within the 1967 borders. That is why we are committed to the substance of that proposed meeting  which should be held soon with the participation of all parties concerned.  Let me say quite frankly that not a single responsible political figure or leader who does not know that the solution to the problem lies solely between us and our Israeli neighbours. Reaching such a lasting solution can only be a result of the many resolutions of the General Assembly  as well as of the initiative of President Bush  who has urged a two-State solution: a Palestinian State living side-by-side with the State of Israel. It must also be based on the Road Map  endorsed in Security Council resolution 1515 (2003)  the Arab Peace Initiative and the various negotiations  projects and plans that have been proposed by many parties since 2000.   I therefore address myself to the Israeli Government  with whose head I have recently met. We discussed the important issues in depth  attempting to end the cycle of lost opportunities so that the international conference will become a substantial reality. We can move towards that conference together  with clear  realistic  detailed plans with a view to settling all of the final status issues  including Jerusalem  borders  refugees  water security and other key issues. I reaffirm here the full readiness of our people to join a genuine peace process that will lead to a comprehensive  full agreement on all final status issues.  As we promised  we will put such an agreement to a popular referendum that will include all Palestinian factions and groups so that they can give their views and opinions on any decision that would lead to defending and safeguarding peace comprehensively and strategically.   I also reaffirm that we will continue to deal with the rebellion that took place in the Gaza Strip. We shall do so in conformity with our basic laws and so that we can preserve democracy in our country. Attempts from whatever group or faction to impose their will and dark ideas by force and armed revolt will not derail our democracy. It would be wrong for anyone to think that our people  which has for decades sacrificed martyrs  prisoners and the wounded in order to obtain freedom  independence and democracy and to build a free and prosperous country  will follow such an armed group  a closed regime and a closed  backward society.   Some have attempted in the past to play the Palestinian issue as a political card in the service of regional interests in order to achieve expansionist goals or to promote specific ideas or ideologies that would ignore the true interests of the Palestinian people. But we who have struggled all our lives for our national cause  for the protection of the rights and interests of our people and for rejection of hegemony and occupation will not allow such a tragedy to reoccur. We will not allow those who tried to undermine our national destiny to achieve their aims.   I came to this rostrum to convey a message from an exhausted people which has long suffered from occupation  displacement  prison and martyrdom. At the same time  however  they are a people who  imbued with dignity and faith  will build their own future  even though their past has been the work of those who have plotted against them and against their rights.   I have come to reiterate the words of our immortal leader Yasser Arafat  who was certain that the green branch of peace  which never withers or dies would never fall from his hand. I have come to express the pain and suffering of every Palestinian man and woman  of all those who have lost loved ones or whose loved ones have been wounded  of all those who are waiting for the release from prison of their brothers  fathers  mothers and sisters  of all those who remain trapped on the Iraqi or Syrian borders and of the millions of Palestinians who are living as refugees on their own land. I have come to affirm that the messages of peace of the prophets and the other divine messengers who trod the paths of our land remain vibrant  like a tree that continues to grow and bloom. I have come to affirm that the voice of peace remains stronger than any other voice in our country. That is why I urge that we move forward  hand in hand  on the shining path towards peace  leaving expediency and short-term interests far behind.   In conclusion  and from this rostrum of the United Nations  I say to the Palestinian people  both those in Palestine and those abroad  that an important historic opportunity is emerging. Therefore  let us be united in order to make that opportunity a reality so that our people  who have suffered so long  can recover their legitimate national rights and achieve the peace  stability and prosperity to which they aspire and which they deserve. We also hope that peace will come to other peoples who are suffering daily  such as the brotherly Iraqi people  and to those who deserve to live in security and stability within the framework of democracy  such as our dear friends the Lebanese people. Together  let us build a stable world   a world of mutual assistance based on respect for life and for the right to self-determination. I thank the Members of the United Nations for their support. "
"144",5879,"QAT",62,2007,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I wish you every success in your mission. I would like also to thank your predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for successfully presiding over the previous session.  I would like further to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who has assumed his post at a critical moment in which the Organization is facing several serious challenges that threaten international peace and security.  The current session has begun at a time when more than one fifth of the world’s population of Muslims are observing mandatory fasting during the month of Ramadan. We were eager to participate in the activities of this session being held in this holy month in order to stress our conviction in the need to contribute to promoting coexistence among nations and to raise an important issue related to the purposes of the international community with respect to the future of peace and progress.  Given its great significance  I would like to refer to Security Council resolution 1770 (2007)  on the subject of Iraq  which was adopted on 10 August 2007. That resolution has partly restored to the United Nations its rightful role in addressing Iraq’s tragedy  after it was proven that it is no longer possible for that matter to remain confined to a single State or to a coalition of States of converging interests.   The world’s major conflicts have become far too big for a single Power to handle them on its own. Responsibility for addressing them should therefore be placed with the United Nations  as it constitutes the political embodiment of the international community’s principles  laws and broad aspirations to peacebuilding and to achieving progress on the basis of the rule of law and the will of those upholding its authority. If the role of the United Nations is to be more effective  its structure must be reformed to adapt to the changes that have taken place in the world since the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations  in 1945.  While the current situation in Iraq requires that the international community assume its responsibilities  the main responsibility remains with the leaders of the whole Iraqi people  who are primarily responsible for hammering out a formula of national reconciliation that ensures justice  peace and security and preserves the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.  The international order has witnessed both “cold” and actual wars. Although real wars are humanly unacceptable  cold wars are psychologically unbearable because they inevitably lead to proxy conflicts  which are incompatible with a world in which the forces of enlightenment and the elements of understanding among nations and cultures have strived in an unprecedented manner.  The work of the United Nations in the areas of development should be accorded high priority  given the close links that exist between development  security and peace. We were indeed pleased that the General Assembly approved the initiative of the State of Qatar to host the first follow-up conference to the International Conference on Financing for Development  which is to be held at Doha during the second half of 2008.  One of the major challenges that we all have to address pertains to the protection of the environment. In addition to the destructive effects of climate change  the environment is subject to degradation and pollution  which threaten human life as well as that of all living creatures. Such a situation requires both our cooperation and concerted efforts by industrialized and developing countries alike to find new approaches and visions leading to effective short-  mid- and long-term solutions. In that connection  I would like to underscore my country’s support for any measures aimed at protecting the environment and achieving sustainable development.  International aid is one of the areas for promoting international partnership. The volume of aid should therefore be increased and its efficiency improved by easing the conditions on which it is granted so as to promote the national development strategies of recipient countries. In that regard  we are concerned about the decline in 2006 of the real value of official development assistance. Donors should make additional efforts to double the assistance provided to sub-Saharan African countries and to promote the development agenda of the United Nations.  Moreover  given the important  major role played by global trade in financing development  a successful conclusion to the Doha Round would provide new opportunities to promote multilateral trade transactions. While we are concerned about the deadlock in the ongoing consultations on the implementation of the Doha Development Agenda  we hope that we will be able to put that phase behind us. We also hope that all parties concerned  especially developed countries  will show the sufficient flexibility to reach mutually beneficial  practical results.  I have not come to this session to present issues or crises related to my country or the Arab world  although some of them have reached proportions constituting human tragedies. I have come here to raise broader issues  as I am convinced that all Arab and Muslim issues are related to the problems of the world as a whole. In the light of a global understanding of the new phase in international progress   an understanding that emphasizes the belief in the need to resort to the collective international will  as embodied by the United Nations  its leadership and system  and in the set of principles on which the Organization’s Charter is based   Arab and Muslim causes would not be the only ones to benefit from it; it would also benefit the entire world. Just causes are always protected by the principles of the law  and the law provides their true guarantee  as well as powerful support. "
"145",5925,"ROU",62,2007,"Allow me to begin by expressing my sincere appreciation and congratulations to you  Mr. President  upon your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its sixty-second session and to wish you full success in this challenging endeavour. At the same time  I should like to extend my appreciation to Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa for her excellent work as President at the sixty-first session. Romania fully subscribes to the statement delivered by His Excellency José Socrates  the Prime Minister of Portugal  on behalf of the European Union. I would also like to add some reflections on the interests of my country. Romania remains firmly attached to its engagement in favour of efficient multilateralism on all three pillars of United Nations activity   peace and security  human rights and sustainable development.  Romania wishes to be an active participant in all ongoing reform processes according to the guidelines we accepted in the Millennium Summit Outcome. It seems there is a quasi-consensus on the principle of the enlargement of the Security Council but not yet on the practical ways in which this could take place. We all know that this is because the structural reform of a principal organ has profound political implications. It seems also that there is little disagreement on the general principle that the Security Council should reflect the geopolitical configuration of the present-day world. We believe that the comprehensive solution offered by an intermediary stage should be regarded positively  precisely because at this stage it is general enough to allow everybody to see that the new configuration would come closer to one’s aim. Let us see if it stands the test of substantive negotiations. Nevertheless  negotiations on the enlargement of the Security Council should not prevent progress and decisions being made on other dimensions  namely  improving the working methods of the Security Council  particularly on the issue of the transparency of Security Council activity and the possibility of limiting veto use. Finally  with 23 members the Eastern European Group should be entitled to at least one additional seat in the Security Council in any formula to be agreed upon. It should also be re-emphasized that  despite being the most dynamically growing regional group within the United Nations General Assembly  the Eastern European presence in managerial positions in the United Nations Secretariat and in United Nations bodies is still minimal.  Romania follows with particular attention the latest developments in Kosovo. The solution for the status of the province of Kosovo needs to be in line with the international law in force. We welcome the efforts of the Troika to facilitate the negotiations between the two parties. The direct talks that were held today here in New York represent a positive evolution  and similar meetings should be organized in the months to come. Direct negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina will contribute to reaching a genuine compromise that will support the stability of the Western Balkans and the European perspective of this region.  In Iraq positive developments in the area of institution building  interfaith reconciliation and security must be consolidated through regional and international support. The new Security Council resolution 1770 (2007) represents a broad United Nations mandate to provide assistance for development and reconstruction and mediation for political dialogue at the national and regional levels. We welcome the ministerial meeting on Iraq on 22 September last  chaired by the Prime Minister of Iraq and the United Nations Secretary-General. We believe that the efforts of the international community with regard to Iraq will bear fruit. Romania is present on the ground and stands with the people and Government of Iraq.  Preventing and combating terrorism require effective multilateralism  based on the norms of international law. We must meet the threat of international terrorism with concerted action. Global action against terrorism requires measures to disrupt groups involved in terrorist activities through international cooperation. Our efforts to combat terrorism must be unrelenting but they must respect fundamental human rights and freedoms. Combating terrorism must also take account of the social and economic roots of terrorism. No country can ensure its security alone. Romania supports efforts undertaken by international  regional and subregional organizations to build up international solidarity against terrorism in accordance with international law  and it cooperates bilaterally with other countries to prevent and combat this scourge.  The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remains the pillar for the international legal system in the area of nuclear non-proliferation. It is also an essential instrument for promoting international peace and security. Despite all the difficulties in recent years  the NPT is still relevant and significant. The balance between rights and duties enshrined in the Treaty is essential for the stability of the international system. The maintenance of the fundamental principles of the Treaty on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and international cooperation  as well as guarantees to observe non-proliferation requirements  are essential.   Romania places a great deal of importance on developing nuclear energy and promoting its peaceful use in areas such as medicine  industry  agriculture and in other areas of public usefulness. Romania also agrees with the idea that adopting nuclear energy as an ecologically sound alternative source of energy in the context of implementing the Kyoto Protocol is an important choice.  The international community must give priority attention to the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and access by terrorists to these types of weapons. My country does not neglect problems related to conventional weapons and firmly supports the need to start structured consideration of the question of a future international legal instrument on the weapons trade.   Romania is participating actively in peacekeeping operations by providing military observers  staff officers  guards and police officers to 10 peacekeeping operations in four continents   Haiti  Congo  Ethiopia and Eritrea  Sudan  Liberia  Côte d’Ivoire  Nepal  Timor-Leste  Georgia and Kosovo. Romania is also participating in peace operations in the Western Balkans  Iraq and Afghanistan.   The Blue Helmets deserve the gratitude of host countries and of the international community. We believe that in setting up multinational forces under the auspices of the United Nations we should take account of the cultural and linguistic characteristics of the country where the Blue Helmets are deployed.  Romania  now a member of the European Union  evolved under the political idea that democracy  human rights and the rule of law are essential for the development of our societies. That is why we would like to commit to supporting  in an imaginative fashion  human rights  democracy  tolerance and diplomacy as a means for settling all disputes  as well as dialogue between cultures and civilizations. It is worthwhile recalling that Bucharest hosted the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) High-Level Conference on Combating Discrimination and Promoting Mutual Respect and Understanding in June 2007. That Conference was an opportunity to highlight the need to react at the political and institutional levels to combat all forms of intolerance and discrimination in order to guarantee respect for human rights and to ensure that every citizen feels protected by the law and has concrete proof of the solidarity of others when his or her rights are flouted.   I believe that the international community needs to give deeper consideration to some sensitive issues in order to adopt appropriate measures. I am thinking about the need to ensure that the rights of children are protected  and that is why Romania supports the establishment of the post of Special Representative of the Secretary-General to combat violence against children.  My Government pays particular attention to action taken by the Human Rights Council  especially since from last June to mid-2008 the chairmanship of this new institution is held by Romania. The institutional structure of this organization is almost complete. What we have achieved is a compromise. The new Council is not the irreproachable body that we had imagined  but it needs to be used  because promotion of respect for human rights is a battle we must wage relentlessly. The General Assembly’s approval of the report of the Human Rights Council  which also includes the institutional package adopted halfway through this year  will certainly help us meet this goal. This new institution must put to greater use its calling  which is to increase awareness of and respect for human rights and to strengthen those rights worldwide. It must also ensure that States honour their commitments. Romania reiterates its confidence in the capacity of the Human Rights Council to become a sound and credible example in the institutional system devoted to protecting human rights.  Democracy is a global process. Twenty-five years ago  less than one third of the States worldwide could be deemed to be true democracies. Now that percentage has increased considerably and represents the standard. We believe that progress in the principles of democracy and human rights in political decisions represents a victory for us all. With the common efforts of member States  a considerable number of resolutions and declarations on various aspects related to democracy have been adopted. For example  in 2000 the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 2000/47  “Promoting and consolidating democracy”  introduced by my country.   The resolution brought together  for the first time in a single coherent document  the principles  values and practices that represent a framework for actions taken by governments to promote democracy.   Of course there are close ties between democracy and respecting human rights. That is the primary message that Romania and other sponsors wanted to transmit through resolutions on pursuing dialogue on measures to promote and consolidate democracy  democracy and human rights  and reinforcing the role of regional  subregional and other mechanisms and organizations to promote and consolidate democracy. All those resolutions were adopted.  We are also very pleased to see that the Community of Democracies has now become an active group committed to promoting the values and standards of democracy. We are prepared to work with other delegations that are members of the working group in the Community of Democracies. Romania recently took on the task of coordinating the group in anticipation of the next ministerial conference  to be held in Bamako.  As a Member of the United Nations that benefits from constant and sound economic growth  Romania will join the group of donor countries by the end of this year. Official development assistance designed as a gradual and progressive commitment will now be a key part of our foreign policy and an expression of our international solidarity with countries in transition or developing countries. We already have a national strategy  an institutional structure and a budget with a line item for official development assistance. Above all  we have unswerving political commitment. We will look closely at all options for providing voluntary contributions through the United Nations system in setting our initial priorities.  On climate change  the United Nations clearly has a key role to play in assisting regions devastated by natural catastrophes. We are fully aware of the staggering impact of climate change on human beings. Let us recall the words of Immanuel Kant  who said that “Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me”. Let moral law and reason prevail so that we can preserve the starry sky. It is likely that the general degree of freedom has never attained such a high level in the history of mankind as it has in our day. If we are freer  more informed and more aware than our forefathers  we also have a greater responsibility to care for our environment. This year  Romania  like other countries  has suffered the consequences of climate change   extremely hot temperatures and drought followed by torrential rains and flooding. Political leaders must support the formulation of a new legal instrument. They must support scientific research in order to reduce the world economy’s dependence on fossil fuels and to stimulate the discovery of new technologies.   In 1990  Romania began political and economic action towards sustainable development and a sustainable economy. Thus  in 1994 Romania ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and in 2001 the Kyoto Protocol. Given these almost unprecedented phenomena  we need to consolidate regional and European capacity to act. To that end  the relevant Romanian institutions have considered holding a high-level regional meeting to discuss policies in response to global warming  in particular action and support mechanisms with regard to problems related to drought. This initiative will be concentrated on Central Europe and South-East Europe.  Romania places particular importance to the dialogue among cultures and religions. We believe this has become essential for meeting today’s global challenges. My country is rich in cultural diversity. It lies at the crossroads of cultures and civilizations and is fully engaged in international and regional initiatives to promote intercultural and interfaith dialogue. The third European Ecumenical Assembly  which was held at the beginning of September at Sibiu  Romania   the European Capital of Culture for 2007   is a clear recent example of our culture of dialogue.  Today’s world is constantly changing and requires increased cooperation within the international community. That is why we welcome the joint activities of the United Nations and the International Organization of La Francophonie (OIF). From 25 to 29 September 2006  that forum met in Bucharest  Romania. As host country for the eleventh Summit  our country chaired the Conference of Heads of Francophone State or Government  as well as the Ministerial Conference of La Francophonie. In playing this double role we felt it our duty to be very actively involved not only in institutional reform but also in furthering cooperation among French speakers.  Despite criticism  deserved or not  the United Nations is still a necessary organization without which the international community would lose its way. Economic globalization and the information society are strengthening  not weakening  the universal calling  the legitimacy and the moral authority of this Organization. But it is up to us  the Member States  to serve the Organization beyond our narrow or fleeting interests. "
"146",5971,"RUS",62,2007,"Traditionally  the General Assembly sums up the results of the ending political year. This requires serious and joint consideration. It is essential to identify agreed solutions for today’s global problems based on the collective analysis of current international affairs. It appears that no one is challenging that security and prosperity are inseparable in an increasingly globalized world. Our approach should be similarly comprehensive  taking into account the inseparable link between the issues of peace and development  which has been amply proven by our recent experience.   The expanding range of conflicts in international politics through the exacerbation of regional crises  the increasing threat of terrorism  the risk of the spread of weapons of mass destruction and stagnation on disarmament jeopardize international stability  divert resources from constructive uses and undermines the potential for sustainable worldwide economic growth. And it is such growth that is our common fundamental goal. Poverty and economic backwardness expand the breeding ground for extremism.   On the other hand  developments over the past year provide convincing proof that an essentially new geopolitical situation has been developing in the world  one that is defined primarily by emerging multipolarity. We need to agree on what inferences we can draw from this. In his Munich speech in February  President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation called for an open and sincere dialogue that would enable us to work out a common understanding of the current historical epoch and of the modus operandi it obliges our nations to adopt.   The international landscape is changing  due to newly emerging centres of global growth. Today  nobody can cope with global challenges single-handedly. Neither diktat nor bipolar dominance can fulfil the task of world governance. What is needed is collective leadership by major States; this should be representative both geographically and in terms of civilizations. The basis for such an informal mechanism can be provided only by the United Nations with its unique legitimacy.   Multilateral diplomacy based on international law has come to the fore. Like any society of free people  a world of free nations needs universal regulatory principles to ensure predictability and confidence in international affairs. The way to achieve this goal lies through strengthening the United Nations system by further adapting it to modern global realities. Decisions here should be based on the broadest possible consensus among Member States and on the universal intergovernmental nature of the United Nations. It is from that perspective that we view the reform initiatives proposed by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.   It will be in our common interest to make more active use of United Nations peacekeeping capabilities. These could be improved by more effective use of a body such as the Military Staff Committee. The initiative put forward by the President of Russia in 2000 to enhance the work of the Military Staff Committee remains relevant. Naturally  a renewed Committee should operate with the participation of all members of the Security Council  as provided for in the United Nations Charter.   Much remains to be done also in improving the interaction of the United Nations with regional organizations that have proven their ability to effectively participate in resolving security and development issues. A positive interrelationship between the principles of multilateralism and regionalism is obviously very important. At present  more than 50 per cent of international trade is carried out under regional trade agreements. Global trade regulation mechanisms cannot be effective without regional integration  which is key to the economic well-being of all the regions of the world.   Russia is actively signing and using regional trade agreements to achieve mutual liberalization of trade. Russia intends to use its current chairmanship of the Eurasian Economic Community to give a more practical focus to the organization  which since 2003 has had observer status in the General Assembly. Russia  along with other sponsors  will submit to the General Assembly a draft resolution on cooperation between the United Nations and the Eurasian Economic Community  aimed at providing a more systemic basis and facilitating the timely realization of the Millennium Development Goals. We also hope that United Nations Member States would honour the Eurasian Development Bank the status of observer in the General Assembly. We shall actively promote the attainment of these objectives  including in the framework of the process to reinvigorate the Commonwealth of Independent States and build up strategic offensive capabilities.   The international community’s efforts should remain focused on reaching the Millennium Development Goals. We are concerned that today  seven years since the Millennium Summit  many developing countries  especially the least developed countries  are still significantly behind schedule in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Particular attention should be paid to the specific needs of the African continent.   Russia fully shares the principles of global partnership in the interest of development  as approved at the Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development and intends to increase its input to our common efforts in that area. We shall consistently strengthen our position as a donor country in accordance with the approach to Russian participation in international development assistance approved by President Putin in June 2007.   We are confident that concrete steps to ensure sustainable socio-economic development in all regions are a sure remedy against threats to peace and security.   There is a pressing need to use any means available to strengthen the leading role of the United Nations in fighting terrorism. Here  the Organization’s activities should be based on a comprehensive framework  including the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted last year as resolution 60/288  and on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. The Collective Security Treaty Organization is contributing to these efforts and has established useful interaction with the United Nations.  Our efforts to resolve regional conflicts and urgent social and economic problems should form part of our counter-terrorism efforts.   Iraq has become a source of destabilization for the whole region. Ensuring security  not to mention economic development  in that country requires a new strategy focused on reaching genuine national reconciliation with the participation of all of Iraq’s neighbours and with the support of the international community. We call upon the Secretary-General to take an active role in this issue  given the additional power the United Nations can wield towards an Iraqi settlement. The participants in recent multilateral meetings on Iraq have upheld that approach  and we support the decision endorsed at those meetings.   The indivisibility of security is to be seen clearly in the Middle East. Early solution of the Palestine problem based on the two-State concept and the achievement of a comprehensive Middle East settlement underpinned by the international legal platform developed by the United Nations are next on the agenda. We are convinced that this goal could be advanced by holding a representative international conference preceded by thorough preparation. We consider the United States initiative to convene in November a multiparty meeting on a Middle East settlement as a step in that direction. We appreciate the preliminary considerations voiced by the United States side regarding the agenda and composition of that event. We reaffirm the importance of involving the Quartet of international mediators and the Arab League in the preparations.   Settlement of the Kosovo problem is only possible within the framework of international and law based on negotiations. Unilateral steps will not lead to a lasting peace and will create the risk of destabilization in the Balkans and other regions.   Complex problems require an integrated approach. This is particularly true for the situation around Iran. The goal of nuclear non-proliferation is an absolute priority. At the same time  we should not ignore the task of engaging Iran in constructive efforts to resolve regional and international issues.   Urgent steps are needed to strengthen the non-proliferation regime while providing all States with legitimate access to the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The joint initiative of the Presidents of Russia and the United States  put forward at their Kennebunkport meeting  is aimed at starting joint practical work in this field.   We are confident that today peace should be based on willingness to cooperate  especially on matters directly affecting strategic stability. In this context  we cannot neglect the unilateral plans in the area of missile defence. President Putin has proposed a constructive alternative: collaborative work with the participation of Russia  the United States and Europe  and subsequently with that of other countries. Such work could lead to a genuinely global strategic alliance encompassing the entire Euro-Atlantic region  which would allow us to move forward in establishing an open system of collective security. Our proposals are under discussion  and we hope that the collective approach will prevail.  The principle of the indivisibility of security should form the basis for resolving the situation around the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Russia stands ready to engage in that process  and proposals are well known. We expect that these proposals will be seriously discussed during the upcoming consultations.  The possibility of deploying weapons in outer space poses a serious threat. The magnitude of that threat is determined by the global coverage of the deployment  which can endanger all States without exception. We consistently oppose the deployment in space of weapons of any type  and we call upon the international community to conclude an agreement to that effect.  Another outstanding global issue is the effective prevention of climate change  which requires agreed and scientifically based solutions that are realistic and balanced and that do not undercut countries’ right to development. Russia has always stood for a constructive dialogue with a view to giving a genuinely universal character to the international climate protection regime. We hope that the important meetings that took place this week in New York and Washington will facilitate thorough preparations for a successful launch in December in Bali of negotiations on joint post-2012 efforts.  The spiritual and moral foundations of human solidarity are of increasingly vital importance. The spiritual values of all world religions demand that we achieve intercivilizational accord and fight manifestations of xenophobia and racism  as well as the resurgence of neo-Nazi trends. Those are the tasks to be tackled within the framework of the Alliance of Civilizations  which we support.  The World Summit of Religious Leaders held in Moscow last year added a new dimension to this endeavour. We propose to build upon the results of the Summit and to think about establishing  under United Nations auspices  a special forum   a kind of consultative council of religions   for exchanges of views among representatives of major world faiths.  Russia will spare no effort to strengthen multilateral cooperation within the framework of the United Nations. I am convinced that with a continued commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter  we can make progress in the creation of an effective system of collective security  as was the will of the founding fathers of the world Organization."
"147",6018,"RWA",62,2007,"May I start by expressing to you  Mr. President  my Government’s congratulations on your election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.  Let me also use this occasion to thank the outgoing President  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for the excellent manner in which she presided over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session.  Every year the General Assembly provides the world’s leaders with an excellent opportunity to focus our attention on the challenges we commonly face. While some of the challenges can be addressed nationally  the most critical are often not confined to national borders and therefore require a concerted global effort. Hence the centrality of the United Nations in providing the leadership and platform to address global challenges.  That is why it is vital that the United Nations continues to undergo comprehensive reforms to render it more versatile  effective and efficient. As the Secretary-General correctly observed in his report on this subject  the United Nations is “not optimally configured.  Some of the ongoing reforms such as the implementation of “one programme  one budgetary framework and one office” at the country level is a good start for rendering this international body more responsive. We are pleased that Rwanda was selected as one of the eight first pilot countries for this reform.   In the same context of the ongoing reforms  the proposal to restructure the gender portfolio is most welcome. We agree with the findings of the High-level Panel that the United Nations contributions to gender issues have been incoherent  under-resourced and fragmented. The proposed reforms will assist in overcoming those shortcomings.  However  we still eagerly await the reform of the Security Council to render it more representative of the world community and more transparent in its operations and decision-making processes. We believe that this would equip the United Nations with greater legitimacy and capacity to maintain world peace and security.  Let me briefly touch on a number of pressing challenges the global community currently faces. While our continent has been consolidating peace and security  there are persistent problem areas that need attention. Today in the Great Lakes region  those who committed genocide in Rwanda in 1994 continue their destructive activities. Almost 14 years after their deeds in our country  they are still sowing mayhem in the region. They rape  murder  terrorize and plunder with impunity. Their leaders are active in Africa  Europe  America and other places  where they continue to promote the ideology of genocide. There can be no doubt that those terror groups constitute a threat to international peace and security. The presence of the costly United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has not diminished their activities.  I once again call upon the international community  in collaboration with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  to end the threat posed by those negative forces once and for all. Rwandans and the region as a whole need peace and stability so that we can concentrate on the business of economic growth and development.  For our part  we pledge renewed commitment to making our contribution to the restoration of peace and stability in the Great Lakes region and in other parts of our continent. In that respect  we express our solidarity with the long-suffering people of Darfur and commit ourselves to contributing to peace efforts in that part of the world  in close cooperation with the Government of the Sudan  the African Union (AU) and the United Nations. Rwanda welcomes Security Council resolution 1769 (2007) authorizing the creation of the United Nations-AU hybrid peacekeeping force in Darfur  and calls for its speedy deployment. In the same spirit  we urge the international community to support peacebuilding efforts in Somalia. It is critical that resources be made available on an urgent basis to enable the deployment of the pledged peacekeeping forces by African countries.  Through the United Nations  we express our collective determination to promote socioeconomic transformation for greater and more rapid wealth creation  which in turn will permit improved lives. On that note  we also join the many other countries that are putting forward the suggestion of a moratorium on the death penalty as a way of improving those lives and valuing them. That challenge remains daunting in the developing world  where extreme poverty still affects millions of people.  The solutions include increased productive capacities on the part of the developing world  side by side with the opening of global markets to the developed world to permit greater trade and investment. A fair global trading system is central to wealth creation. Improving the quality of development aid would supplement that effort  based on a shared understanding that aid is most effective when it is aligned with national development priorities.  Our ultimate goal of improving lives globally cannot be realized if the challenge of climate change and the associated widespread environmental degradation is not sufficiently tackled. Rwanda appreciates the convening of the high-level meeting on climate change by the Secretary-General earlier this week. We also look forward to the United Nations climate change conference scheduled to take place in Bali  Indonesia  this December  which should provide a clear road map of how we are to consolidate our gains and gather pace in protecting our environment.  The global challenges of poverty  ignorance  terrorism  conflict and climate change require us to act collectively in a manner that the founders of this Organization captured eloquently in the words We the peoples of the United Nations. As we begin this sixty-second session of the General Assembly  let us recommit to our common aspirations and responsibilities for realizing peace  prosperity and freedom above any narrow interests. Only then can we hope to realize the ideals contained in the Charter of the United Nations “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” and to “promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom."
"148",6100,"SDN",62,2007,"It gives  me great pleasure at the outset to convey to all those present the greetings and the best wishes of His Excellency Omar Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir  the President of the Republic of the Sudan  who  owing to unforeseen circumstances  could not take part in this important session.  It also gives me great pleasure to congratulate the President for his election as President of the United Nations General Assembly in its sixty-second session. I am confident that his rich experience and high professionalism will lead our deliberations to the expected successful results. I would also like to seize this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor  Sheika Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for the commendable efforts she undertook during the previous session of the Assembly.  I would also like to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his election to lead this Organization. We have no doubt that he will contribute constructively to the revitalization of the United Nations role  preserving its Charter and the service it renders to Member States in a spirit of respect and transparency and that he will enable the United Nations to confront the current challenges at this critical juncture in the development of international relations  where the international community is faced with huge fateful challenges in many areas.  Last year  our President announced to the Assembly from this rostrum (see A/61/PV.11) that peace in our country is no longer a dream  but rather it is a living reality and an irrevocable strategic objective. Today  I am honoured to tell members that since then  we have resolutely continued to implement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and to make it a reality.  All the constitutional institutions and organs necessary for implementation of the Agreement have been established. At the level of executive institutions  the presidency  the Government of National Unity  the Government of South Sudan and the state governments have all been established. In addition  the legislative institutions at the national level  in South Sudan and at the State level have been formed. At the judicial level  the National Judicial Service Commission and the Constitutional Court have been set up. Furthermore  all commissions provided for in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement   such as the National Constitutional Review Commission  the Assessment and Evaluation Commission  the National Petroleum Commission  the National Civil Service Commission  the Commission to Protect the Rights of Non-Muslims in the Capital and the Technical Ad Hoc Border Committee   have been established and are all now diligently and conscientiously carrying out their mandates.  Under the timeline for the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  the National Electoral Commission and the Human Rights Commission will be established by the end of this year. The National Legislature will adopt relevant legislation following the resumption of its session this month. A number of unresolved issues are currently being discussed and negotiated by joint committees comprising representatives of the two partners and other members of the Government of National Unity. We hope that those issues will be resolved soon  particularly since both partners have declared their commitment to that end. Moreover  it is important to emphasize that peace and security prevail today in South Sudan and the other areas covered by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. That fact in itself is the greatest achievement of the Agreement  since it forms the necessary groundwork for the implementation of other provisions.  While my country reaffirms its full commitment to the letter and the spirit of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and is determined to energetically and faithfully pursue its implementation  we also expect the international community to honour its pledges in fulfilling the requirements for peace   in particular the pledges made at the 2005 Oslo donor conference  the cancellation of all external debt and the lifting of unilateral economic sanctions and restrictions  which hamper reconstruction and development efforts and  indeed  defeat the very objectives of the Agreement   so that the country can manage the burden of reconstruction and development. Peace and security are two sides of the same coin: neither can exist without the other. Sudanese citizens are eagerly awaiting the peace dividends of reconstruction and development. We must not fail to meet that legitimate expectation.  The march towards peace resolutely continued with the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement at Abuja in May 2006 under the generous auspices of the African Union  which served as mediator. The Agreement was a huge step forward towards the achievement of peace  stability and development in Darfur through dialogue. That fact was acknowledged by the international community  which effectively contributed to the conclusion of the Agreement.   We have begun to implement various aspects of the Darfur Peace Agreement. In the area of power-sharing and participation  the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority has been established  and citizens of Darfur have been appointed to executive legislative positions at all levels of Government. All provisions of the Agreement related to power- and wealth-sharing and to security arrangements   particularly the Ceasefire Commission   have also been put in place  in full cooperation with the partners.  With regard to the humanitarian situation  my country has always been fully committed to facilitating unhindered access to the flow of relief assistance for the affected and the needy. We have also facilitated the activities and movement of humanitarian organizations in Darfur. All those efforts culminated in the Joint Communiqué between the Government of the Sudan and the United Nations on Facilitation of Humanitarian Activities in Darfur  which we signed with the United Nations on 28 March 2007. The Communiqué is being implemented through a joint mechanism comprising the Government  the United Nations and national and international voluntary non-governmental organizations.  The humanitarian situation is clearly improving  as confirmed by health and humanitarian statistics showing lower levels of epidemics  hunger and food shortages  a situation better than in other parts of that area of Darfur. The return of internally displaced persons and refugees to their villages is another sign of improvement. The Secretary-General himself witnessed such movement during his most recent visit to the Sudan.  The joint efforts of the Government of the Sudan and the United Nations to maintain and consolidate peace have continued with the strengthening of the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) through the light and heavy support packages adopted at the high-level meeting held in November 2006 in Addis Ababa  followed by the hybrid operation authorized by the Security Council in its resolution 1769 (2007). Our country has declared its full compliance with the letter and the spirit of that resolution.   The progress that has been made on the political  humanitarian and peacekeeping fronts could have been achieved only through dialogue led by the United Nations and other international actors   for which we had been calling for quite some time   not through the imposition of policies of pressure and coercion. Thus  it has been possible to arrive at an agreement acceptable to all parties. That has propelled the situation in Darfur into a good phase  thanks to efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement and the inclusion of groups that did not endorse the Darfur Peace Agreement.   My country is firmly convinced that the problem of Darfur must be resolved in a political manner  through negotiations. Therefore  we believe that high priority should be accorded to a political negotiation process. We reiterated that belief at the aforementioned high-level consultations held at Addis Ababa. Here  I wish to reaffirm my Government’s full support for the joint African Union-United Nations initiative  led by Special Envoys Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim. In addition  we reiterate that we are fully prepared to engage in the peace talks scheduled to begin in Libya on 27 October 2007.  From this rostrum  we call on all rebel movements in Darfur to join in the march towards peace without delay and to immediately cease hostilities  in response to the repeated appeals of the Government of the Sudan. My Government has already declared a unilateral ceasefire  which will coincide with the 27 October peace talks. We hope and expect that the armed factions will reciprocate so that a permanent and verifiable ceasefire can be declared when the talks begin. Furthermore  we call on the international community to take firm measures against those who obstruct or refuse to participate in the peace talks. We also call upon those international actors who have hosted a number of the leaders of those factions to demonstrate that they are credible by persuading them to participate in the Libya talks. At the high-level consultations held on 21 September in New York  it was resolved that the talks would be final and conclusive.  Reconstruction and development are major factors for stability and for strengthening efforts towards a political settlement. We must therefore devote similar attention to the issues of development  rehabilitation and reconstruction  as stipulated in Security Council resolution 1769 (2007). We look forward to the international community finalizing its current efforts towards holding an international conference on the reconstruction of Darfur; we hope it will take place soon.  In the twists and turns of the Darfur problem  my country has been the subject of unfair  hostile and ill-intentioned campaigns from some international quarters that are bent on exploiting the crisis in Darfur to serve their well-known interests  agendas and schemes. This vicious campaign has targeted our country’s policies and political positions and seeks to exaggerate and distort the facts and to denigrate the country's capabilities  its heritage and the values and traditions of its people. The campaign also aims at diverting attention from other regional and international crises. We hope that the international community will shoulder its responsibilities in the service of peace and stability in Darfur and seize the golden opportunity that will be provided by the expected peace talks in Libya.  My country  which has reaffirmed its full commitment to the objectives of peace and stability  culminating in concrete terms in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  will leave no stone unturned to spread peace  security and stability in Darfur. It will strive to consolidate its positive and constructive engagement with the United Nations. Clearly  there is no person or group of persons more concerned  or more determined to stop the bloodshed and achieve peace and stability in Darfur  than the Government of the Sudan.  We live in a world of continuous challenges and recurrent threats. There is no doubt that the international community is more than ever convinced that the only way to confront these challenges and their consequences is through collective efforts effectively and ably led by the United Nations. Such a role is reflected in the special attention the Organization has begun to pay to the challenge of climate change  as reflected in the statements made by heads of State or Government during the recent high-level event on climate change. Climate change and environmental degradation are major causes of conflict in many African countries  including my own  as noted in the recent comprehensive report of the United Nations Environment Programme  which highlighted the serious challenges the world faces as a result of climate change.  We must therefore consolidate our efforts and capacities in order to save our planet for present and future generations. We all recognize that climate change should be confronted within the framework of the requirements of sustainable development and its three pillars: economic development  social development and environmental protection. Sudan signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and ratified it in November 1993  thus committing itself to mutual cooperation with the global community to address the problem of climate change. A global consensus on a post-2012 agreement must be reached at the thirteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC and the third session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol  to be held in Bali in December 2007. A successful outcome would be based on the Rio principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and would take fully into account the needs of the developing countries  especially the most vulnerable among them In this context  the Sudan believes that developed countries must meet their commitments in the fields of development  capacity-building and financial and technical assistance to developing countries and must take the initiative to confront such problems in those countries.  The current international economic conditions and the commercial and financial scenario constrain development in developing countries  especially the least developed among them. This poses imminent dangers to the peoples of those countries  due to many factors. The most important of them are: the paucity of official development assistance (ODA); the unfair terms of international trade  which place restrictions on developing countries’ exports to international markets and impose unfair prices on their primary commodities; heavy external debt; and the negative effects of the process of globalization.  The Millennium Summit reaffirmed Africa’s special needs and made meeting them a priority. Hence  the United Nations should take the lead in reaching that objective. In this regard  we hope that the position of Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Africa will be strengthened and that the necessary resources will be allocated to that office to enable it to shoulder its responsibilities towards strengthening United Nations activities focused on Africa  in particular those pertaining to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals and the consolidation of international cooperation to support the New Partnership for Africa’s Development.  The Sudan reiterates the importance of the Millennium Declaration and of reaching its goals  as well as the importance of other items on the international development agenda  with special emphasis on the right of developing countries to determine their priorities without restrictions  conditions or predetermined obligations that impede their development efforts  as described in the African-Caribbean-Pacific Summit that my country hosted last December.  In this respect  I would like to point out that my country has exerted tremendous efforts towards the realization of these objectives and has made noticeable progress in the difficult areas of poverty eradication  education  health care  maternal and child welfare and combating diseases.  The concept of human rights continues to attract the attention of the international community  not only because of the vital importance of the issue  but also because of attempts to deviate from the aim of discussing this issue with integrity and to exploit it in order to settle political scores. My country is of the view that a new approach based on dialogue and cooperation should be introduced when dealing with human rights  instead of naming and shaming  condemnation and threats of sanctions. Moreover  selectivity and double standards should not influence the consideration of human rights issues  especially at the Human Rights Council  which completed its first year with the adoption of an important document that lays the institutional foundation of the Council through  inter alia  ensuring the independence of rapporteurs in the fulfilment of their mandates and ensuring that human rights are monitored with neutrality. With the adoption of that important document  the Council has truly started the process of correcting the failures and shameful practices of the former Commission on Human Rights.  In fulfilment of its political commitments  and consistent with the attention it gives to all sectors of society  especially the most vulnerable ones  the Sudan was among the first countries to sign the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Women have been the focus of Government plans and strategies aiming at their advancement and empowerment in all fields  in compliance with the provisions of the Transitional Constitution and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. These efforts were crowned with the adoption of national strategies and plans pertaining to the advancement and empowerment of women in all fields.  As indicated earlier in relation to the declared objectives of the establishment of the Human Rights Council  in the light of experience with the former Commission on Human Rights  any effort to reform international institutions will be futile without the reform of the United Nations itself; any United Nations reform will be incomplete without the reform of the Security Council.  While we commend the efforts exerted thus far in deliberations pertaining to Security Council reform and the revitalization of the General Assembly  it is important to intensify efforts further in order to accomplish the desired objectives and understandings in this area. The Sudan reiterates its commitment to the African position  as provided for in the Ezulwini consensus and confirmed by subsequent African summit meetings. Africa is the only continent without permanent representation on the Security Council  although African issues constitute more than 70 per cent of the Council’s agenda.  The fact that the Palestinian question remains unresolved since the establishment of the United Nations decades ago not only tarnishes the credibility of the Organization but also continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security. It is imperative to conclude a comprehensive  lasting and just settlement of this conflict  especially in the light of continued violent confrontations between the Palestinian people and the Israeli occupying forces.  The international community should force Israel to comply with international resolutions and fulfil its commitments  including those set out in the Road Map  and enable the Palestinian people to exercise its right to self-determination and to establish its own independent State  with its capital in Al-Quds Al-Sharif. It is also imperative to reach a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict  based on Israel’s withdrawal from all the land it occupied in 1967. In this context  and to ensure sustained security and peace for all the peoples in the region  we wish to confirm the need to make the Middle East  without any exceptions  a nuclear-weapon-free zone.  Developments in Iraq have further aggravated the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. The increasing pace of violence in Iraq and the deterioration of the security situation make it incumbent on all of us to cooperate and help the Iraqi people in their predicament. This can be achieved only through respect for the free will of the Iraqi people  the preservation of Iraq’s unity and national sovereignty and setting a time frame for the exit of occupation forces from Iraq.  My country has repeatedly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The Sudan supports all relevant regional and international decisions and resolutions pertaining to terrorism and affirms its cooperation with the international community to implement these decisions. However  in order to eradicate terrorism  it is necessary to address its root causes and implement the integrated strategies that have been adopted.  I wish to conclude by reiterating that  in order for the United Nations to continue playing its role  we all have a collective responsibility  one based on a solid determination to make this Organization a platform for collective international efforts that would effectively and expeditiously address global challenges. We also need to coordinate with regional organizations within the framework of the United Nations Charter.  We look forward  therefore  to working together to strengthen multilateral cooperation for the common good  transcending narrow self-interest. My country  which this year celebrates the fifty-first anniversary of its joining the United Nations  hopes that this session’s deliberations will represent a landmark in fulfilling those goals. "
"149",6145,"SEN",62,2007,"Senegal welcomes Mr. Kerim’s election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We congratulate him and will support him as he carries out his important responsibilities. His predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain  a country which is a friend to Senegal  deserves our tribute and appreciation for her outstanding contribution  throughout her term of office  to the revitalization of the General Assembly.   I also would like to take a moment to acknowledge my brothers and sisters in the diaspora  who this year commemorated the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery. That shameful and repugnant trade constituted the worst of attacks on the dignity of the human person  as did its continuation  colonization. That is why I would now solemnly warn against horrendous revisionist arguments that attempt in vain to falsify history. Colonialism in its design and exclusive logic of domination  exploitation and enslavement cannot boast of any civilizing mission or any positive fallout  because by its very nature it is a negation of the human condition. We must remain vigilant and mobilized. In Senegal we say yes  we will forgive  but we will not forget or agree to manipulation.  The high-level discussion we held on 24 September on the serious issue of climate change confirms once again the terrible threat that is hanging over our planet. I therefore welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  to put this crucial issue at the very heart of our agenda. We have all seen the damage done. Mankind has not been wise. We have  with greater or lesser awareness  destroyed this Earth which God has lent to us. We must beseech his forgiveness.  Combating climate change demands innovative solutions  which must take into account the special situation of countries that are not significant polluters but which nevertheless suffer from the serious consequences of this phenomenon of the modern age.   Senegal is aware of its responsibility to join the struggle against pollution. Therefore  in exploiting our mineral resources  we take particular care to restore the ecosystem and to use non-polluting practices and technologies. We have also prohibited the importation of used cars more than five years old and of household appliances that pollute. As we have already mentioned  we do not want Africa to be a dumping ground for outdated technology from Europe or elsewhere.   We are also gradually establishing a policy of combating coastal erosion. On the Atlantic coast  at the high-tide line  we are building a reinforced concrete wall on the granite or clayey base of the continental shelf  2.5 to 3 metres deep by 40 centimetres thick  to slow the advance of the sea. Experts say that the wall will stop the sea’s advance for 50 to 100 years. We have done this on an experimental basis  since it is very expensive. The wall costs $2 000 per metre. We have constructed 2 kilometres as an example  to show that it is possible  because we consider it the ultimate weapon.   We are also launching a project for ports leading into free zones  alternating with tourist complexes  along the Atlantic coast; that is also a way of stopping the advance of the sea. Coastal erosion  from Morocco to Mauritania to Senegal  is a threat which the international community must take very seriously.   In the Sahel region  we Africans are also planting what we call the great green wall  7 000 kilometres long by 150 kilometres wide from Dakar to Djibouti. We have not waited; each of us in our own country has begun to create the “wall”. The European Union and France  as Mr. Sarkozy has said  are ready to provide us with loans to help with the wall in order to stop the encroaching Sahel and the process of desertification.   We have also tried to take advantage of the billions of tons of water that  each year during the rainy season  fall on the Sahel and are absorbed by the earth or flow into the sea. In Senegal we have therefore built holding basins in the most low-lying areas  where runoff water accumulates. We have built 250 of these basins; we are walking the walk. The African countries meeting in Bamako have decided to implement this programme  from Dakar to Djibouti  to create such a “wall” to stop the encroaching desert.  At Senegal’s initiative  non-oil-producing countries have now established an association that we call the Green OPEC  with the aim of protecting our interests. We call on the international community to take on the excess costs with which we have been burdened owing to increases in the price of oil. We also want to turn Africa towards producing biofuels. For this reason  I welcome the launch  here in New York on 2 March 2007  of the International Biofuels Forum. As President of the African Non-Petroleum Producers Association  I solemnly request that all of the Forum’s initiatives and participants pursue our common goal of promoting alternative energy sources.  As we pursue economic and social development in the South  African countries in particular continue to face insurmountable obstacles  such as agricultural subsidies in developed countries. We have already talked about that subject enough. Paradoxically  at the same time that our countries are being forced to open their markets in the name of free trade  developed countries are subsidizing their own products  so we are no longer able to export our products to the developed world.  As I said at the Group of Eight summit in Heiligendamm  Germany  Africa is not poor. It has been impoverished by unjust trade practices and by the exploitation of its resources  which are not bought at their true price. I wish to add that trade measures are not in themselves enough to wipe out the injustice that has been done. We also need genuine economic measures.  If we want to fend off the advance of poverty  we must be creative. But first  what is poverty? It is certainly not an income of less than a dollar a day  the definition advocated by the United Nations. Poverty  in my view  is a set of unmet needs. Poverty is a leaky roof  or not having a roof over one’s head at all. It is poor-quality food  no drinking water  no clothing  no health care  no education or training. Lastly  being poor is not having a clean environment. That is what I call the cluster of needs  which is an entire set of needs and  as we can see  not just a monetary assessment.   What are we in Senegal doing? We have launched a programme to build housing  called the Jaxxay plan  under the slogan of “one family  one roof”. We build nice  affordable homes. For less than $70 a month  people can become homeowners in Senegal. The development in which we are building those houses provides health  education and other services. That is how we are trying to combat poverty.  Allow me to turn to the digital revolution. We believe that Africa has a great opportunity  because the digital revolution is happening now. The Internet contains all the knowledge in the world. Africans must therefore have access to the Internet for their training  information and educational needs and in their universities and schools. For that reason  as Africa’s representative to the World Summit on the Information Society  organized by the International Telecommunication Union in Geneva in 2003  I proposed a Global Digital Solidarity Fund to bridge the digital gap that separates us from the developed world. After many ups and downs  the Fund is now supported by all of the Members of the United Nations. Unfortunately  the majority have not yet formalized their acceptance of this Fund or have begun paying into it. However  all countries in principle are members of this Fund  which seeks to provide computers to Africa and to be involved in various programmes  like healthcare telematics.   In Geneva we launched what is called the Geneva Principle  which asks countries and producers of information and communication technology to voluntarily donate one per cent of the amount of each transaction to the Digital Solidarity Fund.   Let us now discuss the Security Council and the need for Africa to have a seat therein  irrespective of any question of reform. It is the only continent which is not represented in the Security Council  even though it has been said that 70 per cent of the Council’s business involves Africa.  Today  Senegal is at peace   I shall not dwell on this   and we are trying to provide the materials and the personnel needed for Darfur. Senegal is increasing its contingent from 150 to 1 600 and is also providing all the police for the operation conducted by the African Union and the United Nations.   The Middle East situation still gives serious concern and I wish to reconfirm Senegal’s unwavering support for the just cause of the Palestinian people in their legitimate quest for a viable State. We support all efforts to that end.   Remembering the last two wars  we must really try to achieve peace. Peace is not just the absence of war as somebody said this morning. We must combat war in the minds of men  particularly young people.   In March 2008  Senegal will have the honour of hosting the eleventh Islamic Summit Conference. It is  therefore  my deepest hope that we will make progress towards achieving peace in accordance with our religion and the Qur’an. I have already proposed an Islamic-Christian dialogue  which would be a first step towards dialogue among peoples. We believe that if the leaders of the world meet together and make a real appeal for tolerance as a legacy from this generation to future generations  then we will have taken a step forwards towards understanding among the various religions. This is absolutely essential to the establishment of peace.   We know that Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oligopoly increases the price of oil as it wishes by manipulating supply   I know this because I am an economist. I realize that it is the law of the market  but the rest of us suffer from it. I propose that whenever OPEC increases the price of oil  it voluntarily add 2 per cent  but not as a tax: 1 per cent to combat poverty and 1 per cent to combat environmental degradation. Out of the $200 million of profits from Africa  this would be at least $40 million and you won’t feel it more than you do just now  because a barrel which cost $29 in December 2003 now costs over $81. "
"150",6192,"SGP",62,2007,"The item at the top of our agenda is climate change. The upcoming Bali Conference needs our full support. Climate change is a challenge that can only be overcome by our collective efforts. If we fail  the future will be troubled. Small island countries like Singapore will be in great danger. People living in the lowlands will have to move to higher ground. The pressure of migration into spaces which become more habitable because of global warming may well become unstoppable. There will be new conflicts in the world.  We are coming now to understand better the role of climate change in the conflict in Darfur. It does not excuse the heinous crimes that have been committed there  but understanding the water situation in that region will help us find more durable solutions for the future. Many historians are now reassessing the role of climate change in major political events in the past.  We cannot be sure whether our best efforts can stop global warming. The Earth’s climate has always gone through cycles. But  even if all we can do is to slow down the process that will buy us time: time to accumulate knowledge  to develop new technologies and to adapt. For example  the cost of recycling or desalinating water has been steadily coming down and is becoming completely affordable for us in Singapore. Improvements in water technology can defuse political tensions in many parts of the world.   Many problems we face can only be overcome by the nations of the world acting together. Climate change is one. Another is the danger of global pandemics  which must also be kept high on our agenda. The late Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO)  Lee Jong-wook  once said that a new global pandemic was not a question of “whether” but of “when”. With the mass movement of human beings  much of it at jet speed  a new bug can spread quickly.   Only a few years ago  we had the scare of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. We are still not sure why that epidemic burned out so quickly  but luckily it did. During the few months it hit us in Singapore  our economy was severely affected. Our tourism industry was devastated. As our economy is so dependent on external trade  shutting our airport was not an option. Instead  we hurriedly converted military night-vision devices into thermal scanners and used them at the airport so that arriving and departing passengers with fever could be pulled aside for medical examination. We knew we could not overcome this problem on our own. The leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) convened an emergency meeting to which the Premier of China  the Chief Executive of Hong Kong and the Director-General of WHO were also invited.  Whether it is climate change  global pandemics  the fight against terrorism  the multilateral trading system or international finance  we need better global governance. During the cold war  the world was divided into two camps with each super-Power taking the lead in its own sphere. That era is now behind us. A multipolar world is crystallizing. On no major issue can one country  however powerful  now act on its own  completely disregarding the views of others. The situation in Iraq is a sad example of that. Russia  China  India and Brazil are emergent or re-emergent Powers whose interests must increasingly be factored in. Smaller countries too have become more assertive  refusing to let bigger countries ride roughshod over them.   When major international institutions like the United Nations  the World Bank  and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were established many years ago  after the end of the Second World War  the world was very different from what it is today. Because of this  those institutions are not as effective as they ought to be. However  we have to work with those institutions as they are and not as we would want them to be if they were to be newly established today. Unless there is another global conflagration  the improvement of global governance can only be achieved through gradual evolution  not revolution.  We can do that at two levels: at the level of the major Powers and at the level of small and medium-sized countries. At the level of the major Powers  international institutions should increasingly reflect the multipolar reality. For example  the reform of the United Nations  including the reform of the Security Council  should take into account the weight of India  Japan  Germany and Brazil and the growing importance of regional organizations. Selection of heads of the IMF and the World Bank should be widened. Membership of the Group of Eight (G-8) should be enlarged to include countries such as China and India. It is also important that international organizations be held to the highest standards of management. We must maintain their moral authority in the eyes of the world if they are to stay effective. That Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s recent visit to a refugee camp in Darfur received so much applause was because of the prestige of the United Nations and the hope reposed in the Blue Helmets.  On climate change  it is good that the United States has convened a meeting in Washington of the world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. As the world’s biggest economy  the United States has to exercise leadership. But it cannot do it on its own. Without major emitters achieving a certain common understanding among themselves  we will not make much progress at the coming Climate Change Conference in Bali.   The involvement of small and medium-sized countries in international institutions has to be enhanced. It is unhealthy if the only way small and medium-sized countries can ensure their interests are taken into account is by threatening to block the progress of others. Indeed  if every country in international organizations had the power of veto the result would be paralysis. As a small country itself  Singapore takes the view that small and medium-sized countries have both rights and responsibilities. We too must have a sense of responsibility for the global system. A rules-based world gives us more freedom than one where “might is right”.  Regional groupings can help small and medium-sized countries strike this balance between rights and responsibilities. The African Union offers a good example of how the discipline of a group gives each of its members a greater say in world affairs than it could have on its own. Group solidarity enables regional organizations such as ASEAN to play a bigger role in the world. ASEAN will soon be strengthened by the leaders’ adoption of a formal charter next month.   Both formal and informal arrangements have their uses. For example  the Forum of Small States is a loose coalition of 100 countries that meet regularly to exchange views and to give support to one another. They make up more than half the Members of the United Nations. Formal and informal groups can play a constructive role by taking the middle ground and moderating the excessive demands of radical members. Let us  through the groupings to which we belong  encourage each other towards compromise on the various issues. An example is the Doha Development Agenda. The positions are not so far apart now and it would be a great pity to walk away from a Doha deal because of relatively small differences when the deal could add hundreds of billions of dollars to global welfare.  However effective they are  international institutions cannot stop the natural rivalry among nation States. The major Powers will still throw their weight around  but rules can be established for civilized behaviour and to prevent countries from taking extreme actions that will endanger the planet we share and our common heritage.   We are not a union of nations  but we are at the very least a confederation of nations. There are limits to the sovereignty we exercise as independent nation-States. For example  the countries of the world have not only a legitimate right but also a responsibility to decry the brutal suppression of demonstrators in Myanmar. Yesterday the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN expressed our revulsion through a Chairman’s statement which also called on the Myanmar Government to abandon its old ways and take a fresh approach towards national reconciliation with all groups in the country. We applauded the initiative of the United Nations Secretary-General to dispatch Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari to Myanmar and urged the Myanmar Government to work with him for the good of the people of the country.  Six months before 11 September 2001  the people of the world watched with shock and horror the deliberate destruction of the ancient Buddha statues in Bamiyan by the Taliban. We must never allow such wanton acts to take place again  whether the injury is to world heritage sites  to the environment or to human beings.   Behind such acts is an attitude of hatred and intolerance that must never be condoned. If this century is to be one of peace and development  all of us must internalize a spirit of interfaith understanding and common humanity. Recently  the Indian Government announced its intention to revive the ancient Buddhist university at Nalanda and offered it to Asian countries as a project to promote cultural and religious understanding and exchange. For hundreds of years Nalanda was a great university drawing students from all over Asia to study not just Buddhism but also philosophy  science  mathematics and other subjects. That project deserves our support.  We need many such endeavours in the world today so as to create a greater awareness of our common origins  our growing interdependence and our common future. Without that larger sense  the challenge of global governance will be difficult to overcome. Without all countries feeling a sense of shared responsibility for the Earth’s environment  for example  climate change will become much worse before effective measures are taken  by which time it may be too late for many of us.

"151",6225,"SLB",62,2007,"Mr. President  I am privileged to stand before you today in the place of my Prime Minister  Mr. Manasseh Sogavare  to renew the firm commitment of the Government and the people of Solomon Islands to the principles  ideals and values that gather us together here annually for their re-examination and reaffirmation. The privilege of membership in the United Nations allows my country to sit amongst Member States and stand up for  as well as against  decisions on issues that either unite or divide us. Belonging to this Organization for almost half the time it has existed is a proud feat for a country that is barely 30 years old. The experience of nearly three decades of sovereign statehood has taught Solomon Islands many lessons that we can share with the rest of the world. In particular  we are well placed to highlight the fragility of our independence as a nation of peoples whose survival is both threatened and guaranteed by our interdependence with the international community as represented in this Assembly.  Mr. President  representing my Prime Minister and addressing this Assembly on behalf of more than the half a million people of Solomon Islands  I wish to begin by congratulating you on your recent election as President of the General Assembly at our sixty-second session. Both you and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon have been selected by fate to pledge your devotion to duty in a cause challenged by humanity’s survival. We trust you to do what is right to attain the best for the rest of us. Your distinguished predecessors have paved pathways for the progress of this Organization along many routes which you must now travel to fulfil our Charter’s promises to us and those whom we are fortunate to represent.  Much has happened in Solomon Islands since my Prime Minister’s address to this Assembly in September last year. Turning firstly to cataclysmic events  just six months ago  a series of earthquakes and tsunamis terrorized  devastated and swallowed up some of our islands  their inhabitants  homes  gardens  animals and worldly possessions. From that catastrophe alone  we suffered the loss of more than 50 lives and injury to countless more  the total destruction of over 3 240 homes and severe damage to another 3 000 homes. The damage bill is estimated to exceed $100 million. Thanks to the instantly televised news coverage of the devastation  the entire world was shown graphic evidence of the sinking of some of our islands  the elevation of submerged reefs 3 metres above sea level and the submersion of many coastal lands.   Not visible at the time were the immediate and future effects of nature’s structural adjustments on the daily livelihoods of Solomon Islanders. Traditional fishing grounds have shifted. Agricultural activities have had to be relocated. The debris is slowly being cleared. The water supply is being restored. Roads  wharves and bridges are being rebuilt and hospitals  clinics  schools and houses are being repaired or reconstructed. Entire villages will need to be relocated and rebuilt. Life can no longer be the same for the vast majority of our people in rural areas  who depend on fishing and subsistence agriculture for their daily survival. Any slight tremor or vibration causes them to flee to higher ground in panic. The emotional and psychological effects of nature’s non-negotiable terrors are what our people have to struggle with for the rest of their lives.  My snapshot of the April earthquakes and tsunamis and of their aftermath would not be complete if I did not acknowledge and place on record the eternal gratitude of Solomon Islands to all those Governments  international organizations and peoples who offered sympathy  prayers and a helping hand through the humanitarian relief that was dispatched to our affected areas. Without the assistance and involvement of all those who volunteered their time and resources and the generosity of those who donated emergency relief funds  supplies and provisions  my Government would not have progressed to the rehabilitation phase of the disaster recovery programme as fast as we have. It is at this time of suffering and need that we appreciate the true value of human compassion and sacrifice.  With the increasing incidence of disasters all over the world  we must bolster the resources of the United Nations humanitarian relief programme and its capacity to respond rapidly and effectively to such crises to alleviate human suffering. As much as we appreciate the quantum of funds pledged by sympathetic individuals  institutions and nation-States  we are left to wonder whether the filtering of donor financial assistance through national charitable organizations is calculated to whittle down its value through the consumption of largesse in its delivery and administration. Respecting the generosity and altruism of those who give and the desperation of those who need requires that we enshrine the principles of efficiency and effectiveness to guide humanitarian relief efforts across international borders. Human charity and human suffering are done a disservice when disasters create “feeding frenzies” for non-governmental charitable organizations. The recent experience of Solomon Islands mirrors what many other nations have undergone and underlines the need for concerted international action to regulate the collection and delivery of humanitarian aid.  Dealing with the effects of environmental catastrophes rather than their causes takes us only half as far as we ought to go. The proceedings of last week’s High-level Event on Climate Change have emboldened small island developing States to rally together to demand the intensification of international efforts to curb global environmental recklessness.   It appears that the fragility of States such as Solomon Islands has less to do with the quality of our governance machinery and more to do with our ecological vulnerability. My Government wonders: what is so virtuous about foreign aid when billions of dollars can be spent on improving the governance structures of an economy that derives its export income from the destruction of tropical forests  when just a fraction of that expense is all that is needed to preserve our forests and finance our annual national budgets? Solomon Islands believes that the protection of our global environment is a matter of international responsibility and that it can be capably addressed through the enunciation of principles that dictate reciprocal undertakings aimed at the continued granting and receipt of foreign aid.  I now turn to the ongoing disputes concerning the future occupation of Solomon Islands by the Australian-led visiting contingent. My Government has initiated a parliamentary review of the legislative basis for the continued presence of the occupying police  military and civilian personnel from our neighbouring countries. Credit must  however  be given to the visiting forces deployed in 2003 to restore law and order in Solomon Islands following many years of ethnic rivalry and violence. The policing of the crisis for four years has contained it on the surface  without addressing the underlying socio-cultural roots of dissension. My Government is determined to delve deeper into the historical causes of the friction between our peoples and to do what is necessary to resolve the disputes that prevent their reconciliation.   The Commission of Inquiry into the April 2006 Civil Unrest in Honiara   capital of Solomon Islands   whose establishment was announced by the Prime Minister during his most recent address to the Assembly (see A/61/PV.17)  finally became functional this year after the failure of externally orchestrated manoeuvres to derail it. The Commission of Inquiry’s interim reports have exposed major flaws in our national security operations. My Government appreciates the support of and the financial assistance pledged by Papua New Guinea in staffing the Commission of Inquiry. The Commission’s final report and recommendations should be available in the next few months.  Our people’s gratitude to Australia and New Zealand for financing the deployment of their nationals to police our crisis with the help of a small contingent of personnel from neighbouring Pacific island nations is often expressed and is genuine. However  as our fellow Pacific island States can readily appreciate  our sovereign right to determine the terms under which the Government of Solomon Islands will permit our continued occupation by the visiting contingent cannot be undermined by any Member of the United Nations.   The long neglect of our internal problem by the United Nations  followed by the hasty conclusion of the regionally based multilateral agreement  which led to the dispatch of the initial visiting contingent of Australian  New Zealand and other Pacific island forces  have caused the ongoing controversies concerning their continued existence and eventual return to the Organization’s doorstep. Viewed from the perspective of Chapter VIII of the Charter  the nature of the arrangements and activities embraced by the 2003 agreement  as well as their practical application and operation since that time  appear to transgress Article 52 of the Charter as a result of apparent inconsistencies with Articles 1 and 2.   However disguised and rationalized  intervention and occupation allow assisting nations to spend and earn substantial revenue for their supporting businesses and industries. My Government is too nationalistic to become captive to the fortunes that justify our perpetual retention under a state of siege. My Prime Minister and my fellow ministers and parliamentarians remain unmoved by Australian resistance to our attempts to reclaim our sovereignty and independence.   In keeping with our obligations under Article 54  we shall keep the Security Council fully informed of the activities undertaken under the 2003 agreement and shall seek its assistance in reducing the financial burdens that Australia and New Zealand needlessly bear under the current arrangements.  As members of the Assembly know only too well  those who pay the piper call the tune. Our experience with the Australian-designed cooperative intervention package demonstrates the need for greater United Nations involvement in the leadership of future regional peacekeeping operations.  The impetus for Australia’s involvement in our internal unrest was a dramatic change of focus and heart concerning the protection of its strategic interests in the Pacific region. The threat of terrorist penetration through porous frontiers is sufficient cause for international anxiety  insecurity and sometimes paranoia. Despite global condemnation of terrorism  the struggle for consensus on an acceptable definition of terrorism retards the progress of multilateral initiatives in the formulation of a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention.  Illustrative of the potential for overreaction to terrorism is the indignity that I  as Foreign Minister of Solomon Islands  had to suffer when my multiple-entry visa to Australia was suddenly cancelled last year. The written explanation for that decision identified me as a risk to the health  safety or good order of the Australian community under Section 116 (1) (e) of its Migration Act. One would have to admit that that is an incredible justification for excluding democratically elected leaders of neighbouring countries not known for breeding terrorists. Just over a century ago  many of our ancestors were kidnapped and forcibly taken to work as labourers in a country that is now quick to regard their descendants as terrorists. Defining terrorism has proved to be more difficult than deploring it.  Moving from the preoccupations of the past year to our perennial protestations  Solomon Islands is compelled by principle  rather than pragmatism  to ventilate again our people’s concerns arising from the non-representation of the Government and people of Taiwan in this Assembly. Our recent attempts to channel Taiwan’s application for admission through the established gateways was resisted   without any regard for the legitimate quest of 23 million Taiwanese people for self-determination   by fellow Member States committed to upholding a peremptory rule of international law also enshrined in Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations. Organized international hypocrisy is the only basis for explaining the indignity that the Taiwanese people must suffer at the hands of a powerful constellation of States interested only in the protection of trade and investment and not any humanitarian concerns.  China’s assertion of sovereignty over Taiwan must be the pretence that it invariably is  since most of its major trading partners have also forged and maintain bilateral relations with Taiwan  which are ultimately predicated on politico-juridical autonomy. Solomon Islanders have a native empathy for all people who are struggling to reclaim what is rightfully due to them under international law. Our support for their struggle stems from our convictions about what is right and just. Our sovereign conscience is not a tradable commodity. Our rejection of regular approaches for the reconsideration of our existing allegiances to Taiwan is premised on our preference  ideally  to recognize both China and Taiwan on a realistic rather than an imaginary politico-juridical footing.  This Assembly is the forum in which mutual respect and goodwill prevail and enable us to implore China  as one of the oldest civilizations of our world  to pledge its non-resort to force in settling the disputed question of its sovereignty over Taiwan.  As one of Taiwan’s long-standing diplomatic allies  and undeterred by the result recently engineered by international political pragmatism  Solomon Islands cannot shirk its Charter obligations under Article 35  paragraph 1  to bring to the attention of this Assembly the situation currently prevailing between Taiwan and China. The situation is clearly of a nature requiring investigation by the Security Council  pursuant to Article 34  on the basis that it “might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute”. The Security Council is obliged to investigate the situation in order to determine whether the continuance thereof is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security.   Having now brought the situation to the attention of this Assembly  Solomon Islands expects that we will follow the stipulations of Article 11  paragraph 2  in discussing any questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security and making the necessary recommendations or taking the requisite action that this Assembly is empowered to make and take under the applicable provisions of the Charter. A full  frank and fair discussion of the situation is the least the Assembly can undertake to affirm our faithful obedience to our Charter’s creed and satisfy ourselves as to the existence of grounds for our further proactive involvement.  Led by Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare  my Government belongs to a constituency of States for whom the United Nations represents the promise of hope for civilizations condemned by circumstance to eternal misery. The effective representation of our hope  voice and vision in this Organization can be achieved only by the reform of its governance structures to reflect the changing configurations of geopolitical power and influence. Solomon Islands therefore supports the proposal for the enlargement of the Security Council. We also believe that India and Japan must be allocated permanent seats on the Council.  The attainment of the Millennium Development Goals will remain elusive for many nations unless innovative strategies for debt conversion and cancellation are devised and adopted to fast-track the poor's exit from poverty. We look forward to exploring that prospect at the forthcoming meeting on financing for development in Doha.  Solomon Islands has reason to register its disappointment with the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for its tardy action in releasing funds that are payable to us from the Trust Fund for Special Aspects of the Implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to defray the costs and expenses of establishing our sovereign claims to continental shelf areas registrable under article 76 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are concerned that any further delay in accessing those funds might affect our registration entitlements due to non-compliance with time restrictions.  Time deprives me of the opportunity to chronicle many more grievances that we needlessly experience in securing the benefits accorded us by virtue of our membership in this Organization. The appointment of the Deputy Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme  stationed in the Solomon Islands  is a welcome sign of the United Nations interest in my country’s problems and permits us to interact more closely with the Organization in prioritizing the remedial action we need to undertake for the betterment of the lives of our population. With a visible presence in our midst and on our shores  the United Nations will no longer be remote from the consciousness of the people it exists to serve.  Before I conclude  allow me to take this opportunity to extend to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon my Prime Minister’s invitation to visit our shores during his tenure in office. We sincerely hope His Excellency will honour the Government and people of Solomon Islands by becoming the first Secretary-General to venture to my country. "
"152",6271,"SLE",62,2007,"The Sierra Leone  delegation would like to join others in congratulating you  Mr. President  on your election to preside over the work of the General Assembly at this session. We also take this opportunity to commend your predecessor for her contribution to the work of the Assembly  in particular for her initiatives in the ongoing process of the United Nations reform. Allow me to convey to you  the Secretary-General and this Assembly greetings from the newly elected President of Sierra Leone  His Excellency Ernest Bai Koroma  who took the oath of office just two weeks ago. President Koroma was not able to come to this debate because of time constraints.  Sierra Leone would like to reaffirm its commitment to the United Nations as the only international body that has the capacity to combat the multifarious problems of the world. The salvation of the world from conflict  natural disasters  diseases  hunger  poverty  oppression  abuse and violation of rights and the menace of climate change  and the achievement of our development goals will remain distant dreams without multilateral action. The stronger our United Nations  the greater our chances to realize the objectives for which we set it up. That is why Sierra Leone will never relent in its support for the reform process of the United Nations to enable it to respond appropriately to its numerous  diverse and ever-increasing challenges.  The reform exercise has scored some major successes  but the most critical and contentious reform   that of the Security Council   remains elusive. As long as the status quo is maintained  Africa will remain disadvantaged  as the only continent without a voice of permanent representation on the Council. We therefore urge a speedy consideration of the expansion of  and equitable representation on  the Council  to make it more representative  democratic and accountable and therefore more effective.  A new dawn has broken in the political landscape of Sierra Leone. Once again  Sierra Leone has demonstrated exemplary performance in the area of the consolidation of democracy and governance. We would like to acknowledge with humility the messages of commendation we received from various parts of the world for the conduct of the recent parliamentary and presidential elections. As one influential Western media organization put it  Sierra Leone is a pearl in the political crown of African politics.  My delegation welcomes the statement issued by the members of the Security Council in which they congratulated the people and institutions of Sierra Leone  in particular the National Electoral Commission and the Sierra Leone Police  on their conduct in the election period and the commitment they demonstrated to the democratic process. President Koroma has asked me to convey  on behalf of all Sierra Leoneans  sincere thanks to members of the international community for their invaluable contribution to the electoral process. We are grateful in particular for the logistical support that the various institutions concerned with the election received to enable them to perform their respective functions. As the new President said after taking the oath of office  the people of Sierra Leone must congratulate themselves for their historic resolve to ensure the victory of democracy and the free exercise of the will of the people.  No one can deny that  after a brutal civil war  Sierra Leone has enjoyed five years of relative peace. However  peace is not an event. It transcends the signing of ceasefire and peace agreements. It also transcends the successful disarmament and demobilization of ex-combatants  and the official declaration of the end of armed conflict.   Peace is a process  a process that must be consolidated  maintained and sustained. Indeed  that is why the United Nations was established after two world wars: to promote social progress and better standards of life for the peoples of the world and to unite our strength in order to maintain international peace and security. The establishment of the new Peacebuilding Commission to facilitate post-conflict recovery is consistent with the objectives of the Organization. It adds to the true meaning and scope of the concept of peace.   The Sierra Leone Government considers the recent elections as part of the peace process. The people have once again exercised their constitutional right to choose the men and women they would like to serve the nation. Now we must not forget that the people also have a right to economic and social development. The right to vote is inextricably linked to the rights to food  clean and portable water  basic social services and  of course  development. All the praise  all the commendation that Sierra Leoneans have received in connection with the exercise of their political right  the right to vote  will be meaningless unless we create and intensify our collective efforts to ensure that they see and enjoy the dividends of that process.   Periodic elections are important  but they are not a panacea for all needs. Now that the elections are over  the Government is determined to meet the challenge of translating the exercise of a political right into the realization of the economic and social rights of all Sierra Leoneans. There is indeed a change of Government  but that change needs urgent and substantial support to produce its desired dividends for the citizens. Accordingly  I would like to solicit the support of the United Nations  the entire international community and our bilateral partners to help us to deliver on the expectations linked to that change.  Sierra Leone will continue to have high expectations for the United Nations  including its Peacebuilding Commission and Peacebuilding Fund. Sierra Leone was selected as one of the first two countries on the Commission’s agenda  and thus became eligible for funding  which has already had a positive impact on our ability to consolidate the peace. We thank the Commission and the Fund for that timely consideration. We note with appreciation  for instance  the timely support that the Sierra Leone Police received from the Peacebuilding Fund to enhance their capacity to manage public order during the recent elections.  The four priority areas that have been identified by the Government in consultation with the Commission  the United Nations system in Sierra Leone and other stakeholders  including civil society  are still valid. They are all equally important. However  in view of the inherent urgency and the critical nature of the youth problem  the Government will make sure  as far as possible  that youth employment and empowerment continue to be accorded first priority.  We hope that the details of the integrated peacebuilding strategy or framework for cooperation with Sierra Leone will soon be finalized. While recognizing the importance of partnership and accountability  we strongly believe that national ownership must be the core principle of the framework.  While Sierra Leoneans are being showered with commendations for the outcome of the elections  and deservedly so  and while the nation is today being held in high esteem in the area of political and constitutional order  we must not forget that the country still finds itself in the unenviable position of being ranked one of the least developed countries in the United Nations Development Programme’s human development index. Unfortunately for Sierra Leone and the rest of the developing world  the prospects for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the year 2015 remain cloudy and distant. My delegation shares the view that practical steps must be taken as a matter of urgency to accelerate the process of meeting the goals. We therefore welcome the recent launching of the MDG Africa Steering Group  chaired by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  to mobilize the heads of the United Nations system and major multilateral and intergovernmental organizations in support of African States in their effort to meet the MDGs.   In principle  we support all initiatives that could at least get Africa on track. Those include Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s MDG call to action of last July  and the declaration signed by a number of Heads of State and Government and private-sector leaders. We  for our part  acknowledge our responsibility to meet the Goals. However  we strongly believe that the developed countries should fulfil their commitments as partners in an interdependent world  with special support preference for countries emerging from conflict  in order to accelerate their progress towards meeting the goals.  Sierra Leone will continue to foster and maintain friendly relations with all Members States of the United Nations  in particular those in our immediate neighbourhood  members of the Mano River Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). That is why  less than a week after assuming office  President Koroma paid a visit to the two other founding members of the Mano River Union  Liberia and Guinea  and to Burkina Faso  the current Chair of ECOWAS.  For far too long  the situation in some of our countries has been a threat to regional and international peace and security. Sierra Leone would like to assure this Assembly that it stands ready to reverse that trend in the subregion of West Africa  to help reduce tension  prevent armed conflict and strengthen institutions and machinery that have been created primarily to promote the economic and social well-being of people.  We will continue to work assiduously with the United Nations  the African Union  ECOWAS  the European Union and individual sovereign States to pursue the goals of peace and security enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  for Africa and the rest of the world. "
"153",6318,"SLV",62,2007,"On  behalf of the people and Government of El Salvador  I would like to extend the most sincere congratulations to Mr. Kerim on his being unanimously elected to preside over this session and to wish him every success in fulfilling his mandate. At the same time  I would like to express our appreciation of the dynamic work done by the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General and call on them to continue to make every effort to strengthen the United Nations.  Allow me to express once more our gratitude for the important role played by the Organization  in particular its contribution to conflict resolution and to economic and social development  as so successfully exemplified in the peace process in Central America  based on the 1987 Esquipulas II Agreement. Recently  Central American countries celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the signing of that Agreement which set in motion the process of establishing a firm and lasting peace in Central America with a view to achieving  through dialogue  a peaceful solution to the Central American crisis and promoting peacebuilding and democratization in the region.   Following a long process of transition from war to peace  from peace to democracy and to freedom  we are now focusing our efforts on the implementation of an economic and social development model that is just and equitable. In particular  we are promoting an integration process that will allow us to strengthen our capabilities and combine resources to more efficiently tackle and thus benefit from the process of opening up to world trade.  In this context  I would like to mention  in particular  a regional issue that has attracted the attention of the international community and that was referred to yesterday in the media  namely  the Gulf of Fonseca. As President of El Salvador  I wish to inform you that I have submitted a formal initiative to the brother States of Honduras and Nicaragua in order to develop a frank and sincere dialogue with a view to ushering in a new era of cooperation in this area in order to truly establish a joint ownership regime and thereby facilitate the overall and sustainable development of the Gulf Zone for all its inhabitants. That proposal  made yesterday  was well received by the leaders of Honduras and Nicaragua. The three States should begin a new era of collaboration and cooperation in order to tackle and fully resolve issues related to the Gulf. We should not leave any problem in the Gulf of Fonseca unresolved  whether it be by a three-nation or a two-nation approach.  A topic of special interest for my country is international migration  in view of its positive impact on countries of origin and destination alike  and  in particular  because of the significant contributions immigrants make to the economy. Our Government is making efforts for Salvadorians who have emigrated  supporting them through our Embassies and Consulates. In this respect  we greatly appreciate the agreements and recommendations emanating from the United Nations High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development  which reiterated the necessity of fully respecting the human rights of migrants and their families  who must be a central concern of internal and external immigration policy of States  including transit States.   I am pleased to confirm that the efforts I have made in favour of Salvadorian immigrants  especially in the United States  have yielded positive results such as the extension of the Temporary Protected States (TPS) programme  which guarantees work permits and the opportunity to reside in that country with no risk of being deported. Those efforts demonstrate my firm will to continue spearheading initiatives and efforts in order to stabilize migration for all of our fellow citizens.  In the Central American region  we have made significant progress in different areas  but unfortunately  long-standing and emerging threats could still affect the security of our citizens and the stability of our countries. It is therefore essential to unite our efforts to frame suitable national  regional and international policies.   Currently  in most of our countries  as well as in the United States and Mexico  citizens are noting that one of the greatest threats to democracy and economic and social development springs from the activities of gangs  generating a wave of violence and crime in an open challenge to the established order. Those anti-social groups do not conform to the patterns of traditional or ordinary crime  but gradually evolve into more sophisticated forms of organized crime whose manifestations can also be seen in countries outside the continent. Many countries represented here are not as yet faced with this threat. However  the criminal activities of such groups are expanding  both substantively and quantitatively  as is actually apparent and thus the treatment of this issue requires action and cooperation of all States  especially in Latin America. As for El Salvador  we are making efforts that have led to the reduction of crime and homicide perpetuated by such groups through joint actions involving our public security authorities  the judicial system and the legislative authority. At the same time  we are coordinating efforts and adopting measures within the framework of security policies for Central America.  We have to strengthen global cooperation in the fight against terrorism  which is one of the greatest threats to peace and international security. The recent thwarted terrorist attacks in European countries and the repeated threats by extremist groups to continue with their terrorist actions in different parts of the world are a grave threat and danger looming over our society. Consequently  we welcome the efforts of Member States of the United Nations to adopt a global counter-terrorism strategy  giving particular importance to preventing and combating terrorism on a unified  coherent and coordinated basis.  The Middle East is a region in which nations have developed different missions and supported initiatives for a just and lasting solution to the problem  while the United Nations itself has made undoubted efforts to that end  which  unfortunately  have not been successful.  We support any initiative or effort to redirect the peace process. In particular  we welcome the initiative to convene an international peace conference for the Middle East in November. That initiative is a source of renewed hope for achieving the long-awaited peace that will allow all peoples of the region to live free from fear  violence and destruction. It would also establish an environment conducive to political cooperation and to shared economic and social development. We recognize the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination  as well as Israel’s right to live within secure and internationally recognized borders  so that both peoples can live in peace.  Taiwan is a unique political reality in the international community. It has systematically developed  in particular in recent years  under the leadership of President Chen Shui-bian. He has made his country a modern  peaceful entity that is resolutely determined to promote peace and international cooperation. Given that reality  we acknowledge the legitimate right of more than 23 million Taiwanese to determine their own future  just as other peoples have done. That is why we support the initiative to have the General Assembly review the case of Taiwan in the light of current global realities  acknowledging the right of the Taiwanese to hold a referendum on joining this international Organization.  El Salvador will continue to play an active role in the reform process of the United Nations  which  we reiterate  should be comprehensive. In that regard  since States are responsible for complying with the objectives of the Charter  we must strive not only to achieve consensus and move towards Security Council reform  but also to revitalize the General Assembly and thoroughly revise the mandate of the Economic and Social Council.  The current economic situation has improved for some developing countries that have achieved acceptable rates of growth. However  international instability in prices  commodities and raw materials   in particular the high prices for petroleum   is having a negative impact on our development efforts. Indeed  global economic short- and mid-term imbalances must be anticipated and prevented  and require the coordination of international macroeconomic policy involving developed and underdeveloped countries.  In an effort to review the criteria and conditions for the extension of international cooperation  the first Intergovernmental Conference on Middle-Income Countries took place in Madrid on 1 and 2 March. At the Conference  we identified several areas for strategic action that could guide the efforts of international donors to contribute to the development of that group of countries. We thank the Government of Spain for its readiness to host the event and for the meeting’s success. We also express our gratitude to King Abdullah II of Jordan and his Government for convening the summit of the Group of Eleven in May  and in particular for the recommendation that resulted from that forum.  Next October  my country  El Salvador  will host the second International Conference on Development Cooperation with Middle-Income Countries in order to further study international measures allowing us to meet the Millennium Development Goals. We believe that donor countries and international financial organizations should reassess their development cooperation policies with the principal aim of encouraging those countries which are responsibly implementing transparent growth strategies that are adequately endowed in terms of finance management and of the quality and impact of projects. To the middle-income countries and the entire cooperating community  including international financial organizations  I reiterate here our cordial invitation to join us in the important event to take place in San Salvador in October.  With respect to development  I would stress that  in the past 10 years  my country has reduced the level of overall poverty from 65 per cent to 30 per cent. One of my Government’s priorities is and will continue to be fighting extreme poverty  towards which we are implementing a series of substantive social programmes. One of the most important of those is the Solidarity Network  through which we directly support families living in extreme poverty  mainly in the rural areas  by granting health and education subsidies and by providing infrastructure  basic services and opportunities to enter the labour market through  inter alia  the provision of microcredit. We have also established a special health fund through which we have increased basic health care for the most vulnerable sectors of the population  seeking to benefit more than 4 million people through comprehensive programmes to include prevention and the promotion of health education campaigns.  While we acknowledge that progress has been achieved and efforts made to improve the living standards of the most vulnerable sectors of the country  we must continue to enjoy international bilateral and multilateral cooperation if we are to achieve higher levels of well-being. Our Government is convinced that the social sphere is not complementary to anything else  but the basis of everything.  One of the most disturbing challenges to the present and future of the international community is global warming. In particular  as we learn in the impressive report prepared by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  the harmful effects of climate change on all peoples have grown alarming in their human  material  economic and environmental impacts  which are increasingly being felt in countries and regions throughout the world. All States must speedily and fully adopt corrective measures in order substantially to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so as to halt the trend towards irreversible and massive environmental degradation. To that end  we urge developed countries to join in the efforts to curb that trend with responsibility and in a common but differentiated manner.  Alongside international efforts for environmental protection  the countries of Latin America  including those of Central America  Mexico and Colombia  members of the Puebla-Panama Plan  are undertaking measures and coordinating regional and subregional activities in the field of renewable and sustainable energy as alternatives to fossil fuels. Concerned by the instability of international hydrocarbon fuel prices  at the previous session of the General Assembly we proposed that the topic be included on the agenda because of its impact on economic development  in particular in developing countries. In the current situation of ever-spiralling high prices  we reiterate that proposal. We have been increasingly diverting precious economic resources that could  in other circumstances  be directed towards other programmes essential to our countries’ human development.   That is why  at this global forum  we appeal to the oil-producing countries to seek  on the basis of international cooperation and solidarity  to implement flexible mechanisms to prevent hydrocarbon fuel prices from drastically impacting developing countries. We in the United Nations cannot ignore that issue  because countries that depend on oil could be bankrupted in the coming years.  I must mention that  faced with high oil prices  we are promoting several initiatives in El Salvador in the area of alternative and renewable energy  such as biofuels. One of those initiatives has led to the formulation of a bill on incentives for investing in renewable energy. We also analysed the economic and technical feasibility of introducing a plan to produce ethanol on a national scale. That is in addition to stepping up thermal energy  which in El Salvador already represents 23 per cent of energy consumption with the entry into operation of the new plant in the eastern part of El Salvador. Similarly  we are beginning technical and financial feasibility studies to promote the production of biodiesel through the establishment of a pilot plant and the use of different crops  which will make it possible to promote reforestation and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  relying for this on the direct support of the United States  Brazil and Colombia.   We believe that Latin American and other developing countries could contribute substantively to global environmental conservation efforts. But efforts will be limited if industrialized countries do not fully assume their responsibilities when it comes to the environment.  Lastly  I would like to recall that we are all representatives of our respective countries and they are the ones that we must serve and protect from the threats that we face. We are convinced that the future of humanity will depend on the decisions and actions that we will adopt here and that we will implement in areas of common global interest. We have the responsibility and obligation to act  and this we must do in order to avert a problem of uncontrollable proportions.   We must understand that the future of humanity will depend on the decisions and actions that we adopt today  but I would like to strongly emphasize that people reach development as a result of perseverance  order  work  discipline and long-term vision. The transformation process and the progress that has been achieved in economic and social policy in the democratic institutions of my country are the result of the exercise of freedoms. Progress is built and gains momentum when people work hard  persevere and have full freedom  which makes it possible to move towards the implementation of the greatest dream that people have: to enjoy progress and social peace.   I invite the Assembly to combine their efforts to consolidate freedoms in those countries that already enjoy them and to return freedoms to countries that do not have them or have lost them. Let us remember that the dearest freedom is the one that we do not have  that liberty is not missed until we lose it. Without freedom  there is no economic and social progress. We must work every day for freedoms that are threatened by extreme radicalism or populist demagoguery  the seeds that destroy freedom. God bless the world. "
"154",6343,"SMR",62,2007,"On behalf of  the Government and the people of the Republic of San Marino  I join the unanimous tribute paid to you  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session by expressing my most sincere congratulations on your election to this high office. I am confident that you will be able to give new momentum to the process of renewal and reform of the United Nations.  In particular  I wish to express my gratitude and appreciation to the outgoing President  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  who has carried out with determination and commitment an intense activity aimed at implementing the reform programme undertaken by the Secretary-General.  The Republic of San Marino is deeply concerned about the latest events in Myanmar and expresses its solidarity to the families of the victims. We hope that the violence will soon be stopped and a dialogue immediately re-established.  The Republic of San Marino firmly believes in the role and effectiveness of the entire structure of the United Nations  as well as in the process of progressive renewal of its main bodies  which is now more than ever necessary  given time  evolution and the need to best enhance the participation by the great family of the Member States in the management of the Organization.  A small country like San Marino gains considerable strength and legitimacy from the major international organizations in its efforts to make its voice heard regarding the great issues and main challenges of our time. We are still determined to play this role and will continue to fulfil the commitments undertaken  individually or in partnership with other countries  to affirm those principles of solidarity and the protection of rights  in which our history is rooted.  In this regard  we believe that forms of cooperation among small countries can prove undoubtedly useful to major projects and deliver positive and effective messages of multilateral cooperation  in a spirit of mutual belonging to an international community  albeit still characterized by large gaps. In this context  an example is the commitment taken by San Marino  together with a group of small European countries  in favour of a United Nations Children’s Fund project against HIV and destined for children living in Gabon. At the same time  the small countries are intensifying their contacts within the United Nations to adopt further joint intervention programmes  mainly of a humanitarian character.  The Republic of San Marino promotes and supports  with the strength of its millenary history of civilization  peace and respect for human rights  any call advanced at a national or international level entailing a moral and civil commitment to the affirmation of specific ideological and cultural identities  which  as is the case for San Marino  are based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for others.  It is in this spirit that my country believes in and actively commits itself to the promotion of intercultural and interreligious dialogue  as a fundamental instrument to prevent tensions and conflicts arising from intolerance and to promote peace based on the principles of respect for fundamental human rights  justice and international cooperation.  During its six-month chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe  which ended last May  the Republic of San Marino based its activity on the promotion of a culture of tolerance and mutual understanding by organizing high-level meetings and debates aimed at fostering dialogue among cultures and religions. In this context  the conference organized last April in San Marino on the religious dimension of intercultural dialogue in Europe  a priority issue of the San Marino chairmanship  met with great success. This conference was attended by the representatives of the Council of Europe member countries  religious leaders belonging to the three major European monotheistic religions and experts from civil society. At the end of its work  the conference adopted a final document  which testifies to the wide range of this debate and marks a significant moment in the process undertaken by the Council of Europe to promote  stimulate and develop intercultural dialogue in Europe  with particular reference to its religious dimension.  Among the initiatives taken in the last few months on this issue  it is worth mentioning the meeting organized by the Permanent Mission of San Marino in New York on dialogue between religions  with the presence and participation of the Secretary-General  the President of the General Assembly and representatives of more than 70 countries.  In line with its history of peace  which makes it an ideal place for meeting and mediation  the Republic of San Marino will coordinate  starting from next year  the future meetings of the Council of Europe on the religious dimension of intercultural dialogue. It is in this spirit that I will take part next week in the High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace  organized by the presidency of the General Assembly.  My country welcomes the adoption of this initiative  which further stresses the need for us to join our efforts in support of dialogue among cultures and religions  as an instrument to strengthen the climate of confidence indispensable to promote peace  prevent conflicts and combat the threat of discrimination  racism  violence and terrorism.  The Republic of San Marino is particularly sensitive to the issue of climate change  in the conviction that addressing this problem is an imperative for each member of the international community  called upon to take action and share common strategies to prevent and face situations of degradation and extreme emergency  which are becoming increasingly evident and require joint actions that can no longer be postponed. We are witnessing alarming phenomena that are deteriorating every element of the environment  mainly due to human activities. It is therefore necessary to develop alternative strategies  which can protect the climate from the increasingly serious threat posed to the entire ecosystem.  The San Marino Government has expressed its strong determination to progressively accede to the major international instruments  adopted in the framework of the United Nations  on environmental protection and gas emissions  from the Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol thereto  to the Kyoto Protocol  in the awareness that the consequences of climate change are a serious obstacle to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. At a domestic level  San Marino is preparing legislation promoting new technologies based on renewable energy sources that will substantially modify the energetic and environmental habits of the entire country.  Just a few days ago  the Secretary-General organized a high-level event on climate change  which gave further momentum to the activity of our Governments.  It is worth reiterating that we take a strong stance against the death penalty on the basis of political and moral principles. Indeed  the death penalty denies the right to life  and we deem it a groundless deterrent  as do an increasing number of countries  which are progressively abolishing it from their legal systems. The Republic of San Marino expresses its satisfaction at the steps taken in this direction at a multilateral level and supports the new interregional initiative. We are convinced that by promoting first of all a moratorium  each and every country can gradually achieve a moderate attitude and eventually reach the decision to abolish the death penalty.  San Marino fully shares the commitment undertaken on a global scale to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and is ready to offer its own contribution and its partnership to eradicate endemic problems  by fully recognizing the fundamental rights of the most vulnerable groups of society  such as the elderly  women  children and disabled people.  In this regard  I would like to underline in particular the value of the action carried out by the United Nations in favour of social policies addressed to persons with disabilities  which has led to the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. In this context  the Republic of San Marino was one of the first States to subscribe to these instruments.  To achieve these objectives  which were also among the main issues included in the programme of the recent chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe  my country has launched some awareness raising and effective intervention campaigns  such as the campaign on violence against women and in favour of children’s rights.  I wish to refer in particular to the protection of children’s rights  to which my country pays special attention  prompted by the conviction that only the mobilization of Governments and societies can save children all over the world from today’s sufferings and from enduring conditions of underdevelopment and poverty. My country has promoted legislative measures and solidarity initiatives with the precious contribution of institutions and civil society  and it commits itself at a political  moral and social level to providing any possible instrument of protection and guarantee in favour of minors.  It is in this spirit and in full agreement with the principles contained in the detailed study on violence against children  drafted by United Nations expert Paulo Sergio Pinheiro  that the Republic of San Marino will soon sign the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse  adopted by the Council of Europe and aimed at involving the States in the drafting and implementation of an international plan to prevent and counter these phenomena.  San Marino is fully aware of the need for the United Nations to maintain and strengthen its own structure by revitalizing the main bodies  to attain improved efficiency and progressive adjustment to a broader multilateral context.  In the light of the above and well aware of its status as a small country  San Marino is however intensifying its activities within the major international organizations. It has responsibly taken on the task of facilitator assigned to it and to Senegal by the President of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly in the revitalization process of this organ.  This task  performed by the San Marino Permanent Mission in New York  attributes to this tiny State a delicate and important role at an international level  which certainly represents a significant recognition of the work done since 1992 to the present and of the commitment with which the Republic participates in the life of the international community  with its renewed efforts to enhance dialogue and cooperation.  The objective of revitalizing the General Assembly is a priority in the reform and modernization process of the main bodies of the United Nations  since the General Assembly is the main representative and decision-making body of the Organization  where all States are permanent members and can and must play an important role by virtue of the principles of democracy and equal representation enshrined in this Organization.  The Republic of San Marino believes it necessary to strengthen the role of the General Assembly by enabling it to act efficiently and to cooperate with other statutory bodies in a more coordinated manner. In this regard  San Marino expresses the hope that  in order to fully support the activities of this body  which is responsible for the whole process of standardization and codification of international law  the international community will commit itself to increasingly receiving and implementing its resolutions.  At the same time  it reiterates the need to reach the broadest possible political agreement on the reform of the Security Council. This agreement should be the result of a concerted and open vision in view of any adjustments that may be required in the years to come. For many years  San Marino has constantly paid great attention to this issue of topical interest  because of its strategic and structural implications. In this regard  I believe that today the presidency of the General Assembly deserves our unanimous gratitude for its report  which represents an excellent basis to continue to consider this item on the agenda of the sixty-second session.  On behalf of a State  the Republic of San Marino  that has always based its peaceful coexistence with other States and the spirit of its profound national and international solidarity on aspirations for international peace and security  I would like to express my complete confidence in the long-term effectiveness of the United Nations system. Each and every State must try to make a political and ideological contribution through concrete proposals to that system  on which every State continues to place high expectations because of the impact of its activities at a national and international level.  Allow me to conclude my statement by offering a brief reflection  by virtue of the fact that I come from a country without any macroeconomic or military interests  or any interests regarding the political balance among the great Powers. I believe that the space and attention we all devote to the international commitment and contribution made by every State  even the smallest  can be a positive investment in the future of the United Nations  a future characterized by increased understanding  closer cooperation and the promotion of dialogue and mutual respect  upon which the foundations of this Organization rest.  This renewed momentum will therefore provide large countries with the opportunity to demonstrate their full respect for international justice and will show small countries how useful their activities are in the community of nations   activities that translate into continuous efforts aimed at achieving peace  mutual understanding and better living conditions for all peoples.  With those hopes in mind  I express to you  Sir  my most sincere wishes for a successful presidency of this greatest of world assemblies  and I assure you that you can fully rely on our support throughout the sixty-second session. "
"155",6380,"SOM",62,2007,"It is indeed an honour for me to extend to Mr. Kerim the sincere congratulations of the Government of Somalia upon his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. His tenure comes at a crucial period for the international community as tensions and instability have surfaced and the United Nations has also embarked on a series of world-changing reforms. My delegation is confident that he will rise to the challenges and steer this body competently during the sixty-second session.  Fitting tribute is also due to his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her sterling guidance and exemplary way of steering the proceedings of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly during some of the most trying times for the United Nations.  Permit me also to express on behalf of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia my sincere felicitations to the new Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who has had a distinguished career in international diplomacy and who brings that extensive experience to the United Nations. Those skills will be crucial in his new assignment. We are confident that he will be a beacon of hope in keeping the United Nations ideal alive during the years ahead.  May I also take this opportunity to congratulate Ms. Asha-Rose Migiro on her appointment to the High Office of Deputy Secretary-General.  The President returned to the Chair.  One of the major principles of the United Nations Charter is to maintain peace and security  and to that end to take effective measures for the prevention and removal of breaches to world peace and security. It is in that conviction that I appear before this body to underscore the concerns of the Federal Government of Somalia on political and security matters related to the roles that should be assumed by the international community.  Regrettably  we feel that our major efforts in nation-building and State-institution development have met with an unreceptive response and reticence of an inexplicable nature. Collective action by this world body has been more consistent and vigorous  until very recently  in coming to the rescue of nations in dire need of help. A case in point concerning that incomprehensible attitude is the long-delayed adoption of a resolution on the timely deployment of a peacekeeping mission in Somalia. If that stand continues  it will reveal only a lack of commitment and indirect acquiescence to prolonging the agony of the Somali people. We call upon the United Nations to come out without delay in support of the deployment of the multinational forces. The Transitional Federal Government of Somalia has diligently embarked on implementing the tasks mandated by our Charter before the end of the transitional period in 2009. Those include  among other things  securing democratic transformation  putting in place permanent constitutional legality  establishing a multi-party democratic society  and setting up regional autonomous administrations. The federal institutions in charge of that arduous task are working hard to provide the nation with a federal constitution that upholds those fundamental obligations  thus signalling a new era of tranquillity for the Somali people.  The efforts of the Federal Government culminated in the convening of a peace and national reconciliation conference in Somalia this year  indicating that national consciousness is regenerating within our society and a self-healing process has begun.  Despite disruptive intimidations by terrorist elements that tried to hijack the proceedings  the conference came to a successful conclusion. Representatives of all walks of life in the Somali community attended the conference and dealt with issues of concern in every aspect. In that regard  we pay special tribute to the helping hand of the Ethiopian forces and the Uganda-led African Union Mission in Somalia  which effectively dealt with the terrorists  who are gradually fading away.  Here  I wish to underscore that peace  security and the well-being and prosperity of individuals and nations alike are at stake in the fight against terrorism. It is our view that the only viable response to terrorism is a collective response of all nations  and it is for that reason that the United Nations system has a pivotal role to play and vital contributions to make in many aspects of counter-terrorism  from promoting the rule of law and effective criminal justice systems to ensuring that countries have the means to counter terrorism. No other institution has the means to unify nations in the fight against that evil  and there is no better venue for nations to forge their protective measures.  Our efforts aimed at nation-building  restoring peace and stability  conflict resolution  reconstruction and rehabilitation cannot have the expected impact unless the required funding resources and the needed equipment and supplies are made available as the days of institutional disharmony are replaced by an immense aspiration to rebuild the country. We therefore reiterate our repeated calls for a pledging conference  and appeal to the donor community to show serious commitment to organizing and convening an international donor conference  in coordination with the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia.  Another area that cries out for speedy action is the humanitarian needs in Somalia. As members are all aware  the protracted civil war and persistent fragmented conflicts over the past two decades have been exacerbated by natural disasters that have not only devastated public and private institutions  but have also torn the socio-economic fabric of society and contributed to grave humanitarian crises. We appeal to the world community to make generous contributions and to work closely with the Somali authorities to ensure that humanitarian access is provided to the most vulnerable populations. Meeting those humanitarian needs will ultimately provide a strong foundation from which recovery  reconstruction and development can emerge in the future.  This historical moment requires bold initiatives on the part of the President of the General Assembly  who  in tandem with the Secretary-General  is called upon to provide the vision and strength of conviction necessary to carry the United Nations forward to face the myriad challenges to the Organization. We are confident that  by working together closely  we can and shall meet the challenges ahead. "
"156",6418,"STP",62,2007,"Thank you for inviting me to be here today. I bring you greetings from the people of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. This is my first opportunity to personally congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to thank him for taking on the huge responsibilities he has assumed as Secretary-General. We offer him our full support for the difficult tasks ahead.  I would also like to congratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his election as President of the current session and to thank Ms. Al Khalifa for her work in guiding the sixty-first session so well.   I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General for the choice of the topics for this session  such as climate change  finance for development  the Millennium Development Goals and countering terrorism.  We come together this year at a time of enormous challenges for the United Nations. The world situation is very serious. One difficulty is that the problems are of such enormous complexity that the mass of facts presented to the public by the media make it exceedingly difficult for average people to understand the situation.   Many of us in this room today live far from the troubled areas of the earth. So  it is  perhaps  hard to comprehend the plight of long-suffering peoples like those in Afghanistan  Darfur  Iraq  Palestine  Sierra Leone and Somalia  among so many others. But we must reject prejudice and discrimination and end those conflicts.  For those who still ignore our existence  may I remind them that my country  Sao Tome and Principe  is an African nation composed of two islands in the Gulf of Guinea and independent from Portugal since 12 July 1975. So  I wanted to say that we also join the calls to defeat terrorist extremism everywhere. However  we have already seen that this will not be achieved by military force  but by ideas and ideals that win hearts and minds.  Regarding the Millennium Development Goals  I want to express my regret that so little progress has been made towards achieving these worthy ends. How can we ignore those who are to be helped by those Goals  the least  the last and the lost? As the Nobel Laureate Martin Luther King once said     “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality  tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly  affects all indirectly”.   I join previous speakers in saying that despite all the technological and scientific advances  half of the world’s population lives on less than $2 per day. Twenty per cent of everyone alive suffer from chronic hunger. Every single day  30 000 children die needlessly from dehydration  diarrhoea or infections  which could be all too easily prevented or cured. In many countries  children are not even given a name until they are one month old because so many of them do not live that long. One billion adults today are illiterate; 100 million children cannot go to school because of their poverty.  Now  with regard to how to finance development  we are told that globalization is the way  that a rising tide will lift all boats. But in many parts of the world the rising tide of globalization lifted the yachts and swamped the rowboats. Can private corporations realistically be expected to combine their entrepreneurial activities with furthering social causes? Obviously  some companies must improve their practices and be held accountable for cleaning up their environmental disasters  such as those in the Niger Delta. But to cast companies in the role of economic reformers is unrealistic. It seems that perhaps globalization has made the right to shop more important than the right to vote.  At the same time  we must also be realistic about the results of aid. It seems that international organizations sometimes suffer from poverty of expectations. Our own people in the developing world are also at times crucified on the poverty of their own desires. Instead of raging against our destiny  we have lowered our standards. I think the humiliation of poverty actually scorches the heart and creates despair.  How can we come here year after year and see this despair  disease and hunger and not feel enormous sorrow? We must accept that global poverty is the disgrace of our affluent era. So how do we alleviate poverty? Many say that Africa is poor because of bad governance and corruption. I strongly reject that view. Is it shameful to remember how all of our countries in Africa  all of us  were when we became independent  or how we were even more recently in Sao Tome and Principe.  Let me say a little bit about how it was and how it is in Sao Tome and Principe. The majority of people grew up in wooden shacks  with no running water  no electricity  no toilet and no chance for an education. In 1975  the country emerged from centuries of slavery and oppressive colonialism to independence with almost no teachers  no doctors  totally unprepared to govern ourselves or create an economy that did not depend on slave or contract labour as the only means of profit. We have struggled. We have stumbled. But today we have a vibrant and stable democracy that we are proud of. We have a high percentage of girls in school. We have literacy rates far above the average in the developing world. We have free health care for all of our citizens  although it is woefully inadequate for lack of funds. We have almost eradicated malaria. We have low corruption  while also being rated among the best countries in the world for freedom of the press. We spend almost no money on defence and we have never fought a war. We are grateful for aid. My people would suffer even more than they already do without the World Food Programme  for example. The World Health Organization and the Global Fund to fight tuberculosis and malaria are working with us very well. The Republic of Taiwan  the people of the island of Formosa  with their well-known generosity and special attention to our realities  have been crucial in our own success against malaria. Many organizations and individuals have worked with us for many years with open hearts and generous spirits  and we thank them all for that.  Throughout our 32 years of independence  we have followed the advice of international organizations and built up some $350 million in bilateral and multilateral debt  most of which was recently forgiven under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and other programmes. Allow me to take this opportunity to present  on behalf of the people of Sao Tome and Principe  our deepest gratitude.  As long as massive poverty  injustice and obscene inequality persist in our world  none of us can rest. I say to all  please do not look the other way. Do not hesitate. The future might say that what we failed to do was tragic  but let me also say that what we did do was truly heroic.   Finally  before ending  and as I have done in prior years  I wish to refer to two situations to which I call the attention of members and implore their solidarity  regardless of whether they are poor or rich.  One of those situations is the issue of Taiwan. There are 23 million people living on Formosa island  also called Taiwan. They do not ask the international community to help them because they are poor. On the contrary  they are one of the main recognized world economic powers  and they are helping other countries  such as Sao Tome and Principe. They only ask to be recognized as a sovereign country and to be included as such on the lists of the United Nations and its agencies. This is a question of justice.   Also a question of justice is the issue of the United States Government lifting the embargo against Cuba  repealing the Helms-Burton Act of 1996 and allowing for free trade and free travel. Let the Cubans settle their problems among themselves. This is a democratic act.   I thank all members for being here today and listening. May God bless us all. "
"157",6459,"SUR",62,2007,"It is an  honour for me to address this gathering today  and on behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Suriname I extend my congratulations to President Kerim for having been entrusted the task of leading the work of the General Assembly during this sixty-second session. We pledge our full support and cooperation as we collectively continue our work on the many challenges the world is faced with today.  Allow me to salute your predecessor  Mrs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for guiding the ongoing process of reform of the United Nations and for her dedication and commitment to the strengthening of multilateralism.  To the newly appointed Secretary-General of the Organization  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  we pledge our support in furthering the ideals of the Charter towards sustainable development  international peace and security and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The current international scene predominantly speaks about the devastating effects of climate change  and also the recent findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have confirmed the warming of the climate system and have clearly linked it to human activities.   The effects of climate change will be felt in all parts of the world; however  the impact will be worse in small and vulnerable States. Suriname is a low-lying coastal country  and the majority of the population is concentrated in the coastal zone  where most economic activities  including fisheries  agriculture and industries  are located. A sea level rise would therefore be catastrophic for our country.  Taking into consideration the national interest in exploiting natural resources  it is imperative for a country to find a sound balance between economic development and preservation of the environment. Therefore  the Government has declared a substantial part of our land area as a nature-preserve area  including the Central Suriname Nature Reserve  which has been designated as a World Heritage site by the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Since the majority of our land surface is covered by tropical rainforest  Suriname contributes significantly to counterbalancing the effects of global warming.   A global threat  however  justifies global action  and the responsibility to provide an adequate answer lies with all of us. We call on the international community and development partners to increase their efforts and to continue their technical and financial support to developing countries to safeguard the world environment for current and future generations.   The Government of Suriname remains committed to realizing by 2015 the targets set forth in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This commitment is expressed in our policy documents. Not only do we accept the challenge to achieve the MDGs  but also a commitment towards our people to realize sustainable economic and social development in every part of the country  including the remote areas in the interior  which are populated mainly by indigenous peoples and maroons.  The Republic of Suriname places great importance on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms  including those of indigenous peoples. With the historic adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples recently  Suriname has joined the international community in giving recognition to the rights of indigenous peoples. I wish to note that in recognition of the status of indigenous peoples as natives  the Republic of Suriname has recently declared 9 August  International Day of the World’s Indigenous People  as a national holiday.   Surinamese society  which is multi-ethnic  multilingual  multicultural and multireligious  attaches great importance to tolerance and mutual respect. I therefore commend the High-Level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace  which will start tomorrow.  I would like to recall that the slave trade and slavery were among the worst violations of human rights in human history  particularly given their scale and duration. We call on the international community to continue supporting the initiative of the Caribbean Community to honour the memory of all those who suffered as a result of the slave trade and slavery.  The United Nations is the supreme institution to advance multilateral diplomacy. Suriname will continue to advocate for the strengthening and updating of the multilateral system  in order to adequately address global issues in the areas of the environment  energy  water  peace and security.   Suriname adheres to the rules of international law. In this context the Government of Suriname respects the award of the arbitral tribunal  which was constituted to establish a maritime boundary between Suriname and Guyana  pursuant to Annex VII of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The award  which includes a finding of jurisdiction to consider the parties’ maritime delimitation claims  establishes a single maritime boundary between Guyana and Suriname that differs from the boundaries claimed by each of the parties. Suriname is pleased that the rules of international law have brought an end to a longstanding dispute.   In closing  I reiterate my country’s commitment to achieving the objectives of the United Nations  upholding the Charter and the rules of international law  and contributing towards a genuine global partnership.

"158",6483,"SVK",62,2007,"Allow me   Sir  to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I believe that  under your presidency  this Organization will make further progress in its reforms  enabling it to respond promptly to the challenges faced by the international community.  From the outset  I would like to thank your predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her efforts in performing the challenging tasks on the agenda of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  The Slovak Republic fully aligns itself with the statement delivered by the representative of Portugal on behalf of the European Union. In addition  I wish to make a contribution to the general debate on behalf of the Slovak Republic.  In spite of notable progress in some areas  the Slovak Republic is not satisfied with the current pace and scope of the United Nations reform process. We think it necessary to make the work of newly created structures and institutions more dynamic and to prepare the United Nations to ensure the targeted prevention and solution of concrete problems and conflicts.  We appreciate the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission. We hope that it will become a pivotal tool in post-conflict stabilization. It should give the international community a vehicle for solving issues that extends the scope of crisis management.  Slovakia also encourages efforts towards overall reform in the system of human rights protection. We have welcomed the commencement of work by the Human Rights Council and recognize its primary responsibility for promoting universal respect for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Within the ongoing process of institutional changes  we expect the Council to effectively enforce its mandate pursuant to resolution 60/251. The Slovak Republic endorses the concept of protecting and promoting human rights at the national and international levels. In that context  we are prepared to assume our share of responsibility. We will be honoured to receive the support of other United Nations Member States for the candidacy of the Slovak Republic to the Human Rights Council for 2008-2011 in the election scheduled for spring 2008.  The Slovak Republic appreciates the measures designed to reform the Secretariat. We support the modernization of the Secretariat’s management system so that it can flexibly respond to current needs and challenges  and the strengthening of its accountability for the implementation of its tasks. As a country participating in several United Nations-led peacekeeping missions  we have also expressed our support for the restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.  United Nations reform cannot be complete without also reforming the structure and working methods of the Security Council. Slovakia has been actively engaged in this reform effort during the term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. The membership of that United Nations body should reflect the changed geopolitical reality. The number of both permanent and non-permanent Council members should increase and the Global South countries should acquire more seats. Germany and Japan have our explicit support in their ambition to become new permanent members of the Council. As a small country  we also support those proposals for the non-permanent membership category that would restrict countries from so-called “flip-flopping” between categories.   Nor may the General Assembly evade the reform effort. It is necessary to strengthen its role and authority by focusing the Assembly’s attention on real and acute problems of the current world. The Assembly should also create mechanisms that would allow for the monitoring of the implementation of its decisions and at the same time provide for the elimination of outdated measures that overburden its work.   Thought should also be given to the representativeness of the bodies established by the General Assembly. Slovakia  as a member of the Group of Eastern European States  appreciates the election of Mr. Srgjan Kerim as President of the Assembly at its sixty-second session. At the same time  it should be emphasized that the Eastern European Group is the most dynamically growing regional group in the General Assembly  yet its representation in managerial positions in the Secretariat and in United Nations bodies does not reflect that situation. A prime example of the situation is the fact that this year not one of the Assembly's Vice-Presidents is from the regional group of which the Slovak Republic is a member.  Besides the efforts aimed at reforming the United Nations  the Slovak Republic wishes to pay special attention to the issue of security sector reform during the sixty-second session. We believe that insufficient reform or lack of reform in the security sector is often a source or catalyst of conflicts  or even causes post-conflict countries to lapse back to a conflict state. It should also be borne in mind that a well-governed security sector should  above all  ensure human security  which represents the foundation for the stability  good governance and  ultimately  development of a country.  We are expecting a comprehensive report by the Secretary-General on security sector reform  which should become the basis of a more in-depth discussion on this issue within the United Nations. Therefore  Slovakia has decided to initiate a thematic discussion on security sector reform during the sixty-second session.  The Slovak Republic also expects the sixty-second session to revitalize the discussion on disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Slovakia has had an opportunity to contribute to these efforts through its chairmanship of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004). In this context  in February 2007 Slovakia also initiated an open debate in the Security Council on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The destructive potential of weapons of mass destruction increases along with the growing threat of international terrorism. We therefore also wish to pay special attention to this threat to international peace and security. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the General Assembly last year (resolution 60/288) provided for wide-ranging international cooperation in this field.  The Slovak Republic pays due attention to the economic and social aspects of the United Nations  where we wish to engage even more actively. In 2003  we submitted our candidacy for membership in the Economic and Social Council for the years 2010 to 2012. We will be pleased to receive support from other Member States for our candidacy.  As a new development aid donor  we want to facilitate more effective cooperation with both beneficiary and donor countries  integrate the work of international agencies and make more efficient use of the existing United Nations capacities in this area. We wish to pay special attention to the development of post-conflict regions  which currently receive the largest portion of development aid. We believe that there will be room in the Economic and Social Council for Slovakia to utilize its experience in the field of security sector reform in the joint work with other bodies of the United Nations system.  Over the past two years  Slovakia has worked for the first time as a member of the Security Council. When adopting our decisions on the sensitive problems of the modern world  we took into consideration the peculiarities of individual cases  yet at the same time  we sought to promote the value system of a member of the European and trans-Atlantic community. Slovakia will continue to work within the United Nations in this same spirit  even after the completion of its current term in the Security Council. We also wish to make good use of the experience we have gained in our work in other United Nations bodies.  The Slovak Republic is frustrated that no solution to the Kosovo issue has yet been found. In our opinion  Kosovo must not thwart the unification of European nations nor set a negative precedent in terms of international law.  It is with hope that we view the adoption of Security Council resolution 1769 (2007)  granting a mandate for the deployment of a joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping operation in Darfur. This unprecedented decision has moved the cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations to a new level.  With regard to the Middle East issue  Slovakia endorses a peaceful  fair and permanent solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The talks should result in the establishment of a viable Palestinian State that will coexist with Israel in an atmosphere of perpetual peace and security. In this context  we appreciate the resumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestine and the measures taken in this respect by the Quartet.  It has been seven years since our Millennium session  when we discussed our vision for the future of life on our planet. It has been neither seven rich nor seven poor years. The United Nations has made some progress. On the other hand  it has failed to cope with many challenges. We must do better together to make the future score fall more in favour of the United Nations. "
"159",6508,"SVN",62,2007,"Mr. President  let me first express my gratitude to your predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her leadership of the General Assembly. To you  Sir  on behalf of Slovenia  I assure full support for your leadership. We also look forward to cooperating with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.  An important part of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly will coincide with a period of increased international responsibility for Slovenia. We will do our best to make good use of this opportunity and to benefit not only Europe  but the international community as a whole. The United Nations will be at the heart of our efforts. This Organization still represents humankind in its best light.  The discussions this week have proved that the global community has identified the challenges brought about by the human impact on the environment. The will to find solutions under United Nations auspices was clearly expressed. The sheer dimension and complexity of the issue require that this Organization have primacy.  Today  environmental changes are occurring all over the world. Slovenia pins great hopes on a regional approach in the search for solutions. At the global level  we support the principle of common  but different  responsibilities. A common approach is necessary because of the considerable impact of climate change  including on global security and stability.  Country-specific solutions should allow space for realizing development potential. Slovenia is very serious about its commitments within the European framework. The European Union has showed the will and ability to take initiative. We hope that such examples will set the dominant tone of the overall discussion through the new framework for the period after 2012.  Slovenia welcomes the progress made so far in the United Nations reform process and will continue to work towards the more responsive  effective and representative United Nations.  The role of the United Nations in maintaining peace and security is indispensable. This year  more than 10 per cent of the members of the Slovenian armed forces participated in missions abroad under the mandate of the Security Council. The majority of them helped to strengthen peace and stability in South-Eastern Europe  and also in Afghanistan  Lebanon and Iraq.  In the last decade and a half  the international community has dedicated considerable human and financial resources to the region of the Balkans. The contribution is great; therefore the dividends of peace for the whole region should not be wasted at the end of the stabilization process. We need to pursue solutions to secure these dividends; then they should be further invested in the common European project.  The international community must  within the framework of the United Nations  complete the establishment of mechanisms aimed at meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century. Finalizing a comprehensive United Nations convention on international terrorism must continue to be a key priority. Another challenge remains concrete application of the concept of the responsibility to protect.  Even the most determined efforts to achieve global security have little chance for lasting success under conditions of inequality. Therefore  achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is of paramount importance. Creating equal opportunities for the disadvantaged and demonstrating solidarity with them are sustainable investments in peace. It is only when both developed and developing countries choose to make such investments that the benefits of the world’s current economic growth will be more fairly distributed.  Slovenia was very pleased to become a member of the Human Rights Council. The trust that has been placed in us will be honoured through our active and open efforts to achieve the implementation of human rights standards. We will continue to support the policy of global abolition of the death penalty.  Slovenia attaches great importance to the concept of human security  which is in accordance with the pillars of the United Nations: development  security and human rights. We accord special attention to children: the youngest victims of violence  poverty and deadly pandemics are also the most powerless. Therefore  it remains true that a man never stands so tall as when he kneels to help a child.  In that respect  Slovenia takes particular pride in its full cooperation with the non-governmental sector. The Together Foundation  which is concerned with the psychosocial well-being of children in societies affected by armed conflict  and the Slovenian International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims Assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina were founded as a result of Slovenia’s initiatives aimed at the wider region.  Slovenia actively participates in initiatives on intercultural dialogue  devoting special attention to the Mediterranean area. We hope to see the early establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean university  which would be a Slovenian contribution to raising awareness about the need for peaceful coexistence among those with different cultures and world views.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  one of the chief architects of the United Nations  predicted at the time of the establishment of the Organization that change would be a regular feature of its development. Indeed  the United Nations continues to be built today. The great hopes of humanity depend on our joint efforts  which will never be completed. Therefore  it is my hope that the sixty-second session of the General Assembly will be crowned with success.  "
"160",6553,"SWE",62,2007,"Let me take this opportunity to express our strong support for the people of Burma in their struggle for a democratic future. We strongly urge the Burmese Government to initiate a peaceful dialogue  resist all violence and respect the human rights of the Burmese people  not least their freedom of expression and assembly.  There is little doubt   and this has been highlighted by all speakers during the last few days   that we  the international community  the United Nations  face major challenges in the years ahead. When addressing them  we should also be aware of the progress that has been achieved in the world in recent decades.  The accelerated globalization process has brought enormous benefits to many hundreds of millions of people  not least in the emerging economies. Today  nearly a third of the world’s population live in countries where economic growth is about 10 per cent a year  and we seem to be well on our way towards meeting that important part of the Millennium Development Goals that will reduce by half the number of people living in absolute poverty around the world. From a historical perspective  that is amazing progress. Never before in human history have so many been lifted out of absolute poverty in such a short space of time. There is no room for complacency  however. We must make globalization a force for good  for open societies  open economies and an open world for everyone on our planet. We must redouble our efforts to bring the Doha Development Round to a successful conclusion. Sustainable economic growth  a vibrant private sector and a more open international trading system are needed if we are to achieve the goals we have set for eradicating poverty in the world.  Aid for trade is a crucial complement to the opening up of markets for many countries. The developing countries of the world represent far too small a share of world trade. We must live up to the international commitments on development assistance and ensure that development cooperation becomes more efficient. That is the joint responsibility of all donors and all partner countries. The Swedish Government has initiated extensive reforms aimed at creating a new Swedish development assistance policy characterized by quality  efficiency and results in terms of reduced poverty and more democratic societies. We must now   as was highlighted last week   accelerate our efforts to address the challenge of climate change. The Swedish Government has launched a Commission on Climate Change and Development to address risk reduction  adaptation and climate-proofing development. We must make a dedicated mutual effort to meet the Millennium Development Goals. The fact that we are making substantial progress on all of them globally demonstrates that progress is indeed possible.  Human rights  security and development go hand in hand. Respect for human rights is necessary to achieve security and development  and those three elements are mutually reinforcing. Our protection of any individual anywhere is the protection of all individuals everywhere.  The death penalty must be abolished all over the world. It contravenes the very notion of human rights. Even in that area  the world is making progress  but 25 countries still sentence people to death. Six countries are responsible for more than 90 per cent of all executions worldwide. We all know who they are and expect them to take steps to abolish the death penalty.  The links between security and development  including the need to combine State-building efforts and peace-support operations for long-lasting results  place new demands on the international community. The United Nations must learn from and build on the recent experiences of a number of challenging but successful large-scale missions that integrate military and civilian components. We need to improve coordination of international efforts in the field  for instance in Afghanistan.  There are many challenges that remain to be tackled if we are to make the world a better place. Perhaps the most important is how we should best address the present threats to the existing non-proliferation regime. Were there to be one new State with nuclear weapons  the danger is that another would soon follow. Shortly  those weapons might well be out of any State’s control. The risk of nuclear terrorism would be a very real one. That must be prevented. Our children deserve to live in a world safe from the threat of nuclear war and of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists. Those weapons threaten the very existence of mankind.  To prevent that  the nuclear Powers have a duty to live up to their responsibilities. To neglect is to invite failure. They need to demonstrate their readiness to substantially reduce their nuclear arsenals. Those weapons are of no use in deterring the adversaries we might face if the non-proliferation regime is eroded or collapses. It is a question of self-interest and far-sighted statesmanship.  But we must also address the urgent political issues that we are confronted with. Although the numbers of wars and conflicts have continued to decline  we should be acutely aware of the dangers of conflicts rapidly exploding  fusing together and unravelling the progress we have seen. Let me address two of those: the situation in the Middle East and the conflicts in Africa.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has to end with a peaceful settlement negotiated by the parties  resulting in the emergence of an independent  democratic and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and other neighbours. Restoring peace and economic growth in the Middle East requires parallel action by the Israelis and the Palestinians. Nothing is more important for the long-term security of Israel than the creation of a truly viable Palestinian State. That will require freedom of movement and access to be significantly improved in the West Bank and Gaza. Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas recognize each other as partners for peace. That provides an opening that we should all do our utmost to support.  It is therefore now time for a true peace process  and not of the incremental sort that has been tried so many times before. It is now time to achieve the peace that is the common aspiration of the vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians alike  as well as of the international community.  We urge the leaders of Israel and Palestine to move forward towards a comprehensive settlement. The international meeting this autumn is of crucial importance. But the challenges of the Middle East are not limited to that conflict.   We are convinced that we must do more to encourage reconciliation and reconstruction in Iraq after the horrible brutalities of the last few decades. We must do much more to assist and protect the more than 4 million Iraqis who have left their homes.   Iran still refuses to accept the obligations laid down by the Security Council. Iran has to convince us of the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.  The conflicts on the Horn of Africa  stretching from Ethiopia and Eritrea to Somalia  the Sudan  Chad and the Central African Republic  cause thousands upon thousands of deaths as well as untold human suffering for the survivors. National leaders on the Horn should rise to the challenge and demonstrate their commitment to peace and reconciliation. The failure of Ethiopia and Eritrea to resolve the quite straightforward demarcation of their common border  eight years after their commitment to do so  is a worrying signal  not only for these two countries  but also for the region as a whole.  In the Sudan  a process of democratization is of paramount importance to tackle the core problems and to achieve reconciliation. We must focus on support for the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement as well as the renewed peace effort for Darfur that will take place in Tripoli at the end of the month.  The situation in eastern Chad is worrying. We are impressed by the important humanitarian work carried out by local and international non-governmental organizations. It is apparent that we must do more to protect and assist refugees  internally displaced persons and other civilians affected by the conflicts of the region  as well as support the United Nations-led humanitarian efforts on both sides of the border.  How can we ever achieve true progress if women’s crucial role in peacebuilding and development is not recognized? Gender equality and women’s rights  participation  influence and empowerment are key goals in themselves  and are also crucial for sustainable poverty reduction.  Challenges like these show the urgent need for world leaders to accept shared responsibility for our common future. Sweden addresses these challenges in close cooperation with its European Union partners. We need a strong   and reformed   United Nations to bring us all together. A better world is within our reach. "
"161",6591,"SWZ",62,2007,"It is a great pleasure for me to address the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.  Let me begin by extending warm greetings from the Kingdom of Swaziland to the entire United Nations family.   It befits this moment that I extend our congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  upon his appointment. We trust that he will continue in the footsteps of his predecessors in carrying out the important mission of the United Nations. The Kingdom of Swaziland pledges its support to him as he continues to promote and protect the noble goals of multilateralism.  The role of the United Nations is to promote peace and security  sustainable development  human rights and fundamental freedoms. The United Nations should continue to shape situations for the betterment of the lives of all the peoples of the world. If it is to succeed  there is a need for the United Nations to reform its main bodies. We have met regionally as countries; consensus decisions have been reached and recommendations made  and we look forward to their implementation. As the United Nations achieves reform  it is likely to undertake meaningful action so that when decisions are taken  the Organization will be respected by all.  Many of our countries the world over are facing countless challenges  and we look to this Organization to come up with lasting solutions. My country  Swaziland  is still undertaking development programmes to implement the Millennium Development Goals that were set by the United Nations for individual countries to achieve. We have programmes for building a very sound economy so that our people will have good jobs that will make their living standards better.  As part of our human capital development and capacity-building programme  we are educating and training our people in every aspect to acquire more knowledge and information  and we look to the well-developed countries to share their experiences and ideas.  One area of great concern is that  as we continue to implement our development programmes  we are faced with the challenges of globalization that will affect our preferential markets. That will be detrimental to us  the developing countries  since companies have big loans to repay that were taken out on the basis of better markets. We hope that  as the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules come into force  there shall be considerations to ensure that all developing countries meet WTO standards. In that way  we shall be able to implement the rules equitably and effectively.  HIV/AIDS and other health problems remain some of the major challenges that we face as developing nations. We have programmes in place that we are trying to follow in dealing with the situation  but we are unable to meet our targets because of our limited resources. We have heard of many foundations that have been announced worldwide and we hope to be able to access them. We look forward to those responsible for such foundations sharing the information on how to reach the funds  as well as technical support.  We acknowledge the contribution made by the Global Fund in the fight against the scourge. My country is one of the beneficiaries of such funding  and we have been able to offer a lot of comfort to many of our people. We encourage the United Nations to continue to appeal on our behalf for continued support in eradicating the problem of HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  to name just a few.  We also recognize the role of various United Nations agencies working with our communities in the provision of shelter  nutritional support and education to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. I am pleased to state that our fight is showing some signs of success  as recent statistics have shown a decline in the prevalence rate.  We are faced with persistent droughts that have set us back as we continue to develop our country  and that has been worsened by the wildfires that have recently occurred  destroying properties  crops  livestock and our forest industry. My country is doing everything it can to help those that have been affected by this unfortunate situation. We would like to thank the countries and organizations that have come forward to help us during this period of hardship and we do make an appeal to others for support; which is still needed.  Some of the problems I have mentioned that are affecting my country are the result of climate changes. That is why we believe that the summit we had is very important  and we would like to commend the Secretary-General for convening the high-level summit on climate change held earlier this week. A political momentum has been generated  and it is our hope that the necessary negotiations on the matter will commence in Bali later this year during the meeting of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The Kingdom of Swaziland has developed some sector policies that are climate-change friendly  such as our pro-green energy policy and water resources policy  to mention a couple. However  there is a need to enhance education  training and public awareness with regard to the adaptation and promotion of individual and institutional capacity-building in order to manage appropriate technology development and transfer.  We note that there is a general need for favourable access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies  in particular from developed countries to developing countries  through supportive measures that promote technology cooperation. This will enable the necessary technological know-how to be transferred and economic  technical and managerial capabilities to be built for the efficient use and further development of transferred skills.  We would like to encourage the private sector  and in particular the multinational corporations  to be responsible enough to practise the same environmental and waste management principles in the developing world. We would also like to discourage the irresponsible dumping of harmful waste materials in developing countries.  The Kingdom of Swaziland is deeply committed to the United Nations Charter. Moreover  recent events in the world have been living proof that the United Nations is needed now more than ever before. Sadly  the realities of wars and violence still continue in different parts of the world. Conflicts  tensions and terrorism continue to destroy the social and economic fabric of the era that we are living in.  We welcome the report of the Secretary-General on the relationship between disarmament and development (A/62/112)  in particular its recognition that armed violence and conflict impede the realization of the Millennium Development Goals. In this regard we applaud the United Nations Development Programme for its efforts to prevent armed violence through its contribution to the disarmament and development agenda by promoting and participating in a number of policy-oriented initiatives.  We further commend the efforts of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa both for its continuation of the operation of the small arms and light weapons register for Africa for participating States  with a view to promoting transparency in the flows of small arms and light weapons  and for its programme entitled “African Security Sector Reform Programme”  which carries the objective of transforming governance within the African security sector.  However  we are concerned about the situation in Somalia and Darfur and its far-reaching consequences for regional security. The continued human suffering in this region is unacceptable  and we hope that current efforts aimed at improving the situation will not be deprived of the opportunity to succeed. On a more positive note  we welcome the Security Council decision to deploy the joint African Union-United Nations hybrid peacekeeping force.  The Middle East continues to face challenges and the accumulation of crises and tensions in the region. It is therefore imperative that all parties concerned make an effort to achieve comprehensive  fair  just and durable settlements.  I would like to take this time to applaud the United Nations for its role in promoting its Charter  especially the principle of universality. There is one country  however  that is not benefiting from this principle  as it has been excluded from the family of nations.  I am talking about Taiwan: the Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to reiterate its appeal to the United Nations with respect to the question of Taiwan. We note that Taiwan exercised a well-founded right in international law to apply for membership in the United Nations. Regrettably  the application was rejected without due process.  The Government and people of Taiwan have shown their willingness and capacity to contribute actively to global development and peace  through disaster relief and health and development support to many regions. We continue to support the cause of the over 23 million people of Taiwan who are not represented in the one organization that should be truly global. I would like to challenge all nations to take my appeal seriously.  While our world experiences ever-accelerating political  economic and social changes  it is vital that we cooperate with each other in order to tackle and manage these issues. Cordial  balanced and respectful relations between nations based on the principles of the United Nations Charter will enable us all to meet and overcome future challenges of our time  and make this world a safer place for future generations.

"162",6620,"SYC",62,2007,"Allow me to first extend to all of you the fraternal greetings and best wishes of President Michel of the Republic of Seychelles  the Government and the people of Seychelles on the convening of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. Seychelles is proud to be here today  as a partner and an ally  to further our international efforts  to address the challenges that are central to the future of all humanity and that pose a threat to global political and economic stability and security.  I join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. His election to the helm of this Assembly is a testimony to the high esteem in which the international community holds him and his country  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I take this opportunity  too  to express my country’s sincere appreciation to his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain  for her outstanding stewardship of the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session.  Allow me to commend and to renew Seychelles’ strong support to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the determination and strong will he has shown since the beginning of his tenure in office  in strengthening the role of the United Nations.  Seychelles remains unwavering in its support of the United Nations. Our commitment has not changed since we joined this Organization 31 years ago. More than ever  we believe that the world needs strong and effective multilateralism. Indeed  we are convinced that the most effective means of advancing our collective interests is through the United Nations.  Seychelles is pleased that the overarching theme of this year's session is responding to climate change  as the General Assembly of the United Nations is the forum for concerted and comprehensive action in addressing a defining issue of our time.  Fifteen years ago  in 1992  Seychelles  a small island developing State  was the second country to accede to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We were convinced then  as we are now  that the Convention’s primary objective of reducing the dangerous levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere must be realized in order to protect the environment and avoid serious socio-economic disruptions. Six years later  in 1998  Seychelles reiterated its commitment to the ideals of the UNFCCC by adopting the Kyoto Protocol. However  the attempts of the international community to act on those international agreements have been modest at best.  The challenge of development has never been higher on the international agenda. However  the adverse impacts of climate change are a major barrier for the achievement of sustainable development goals in many countries  especially small island developing States  which are recognized as being most vulnerable to climate change.  We must emphasize again that for the majority of small island developing States  agriculture  fisheries and tourism have for a long time been the mainstay of survival and economic development. Let us not forget that small island developing States are home to a sizeable proportion of the world’s biodiversity and that the majority of the species are endemic and increasingly under threat because of climate change.  In Seychelles  the fisheries sector is a key pillar of our economy. It is expected that changes in climate may cause migratory shifts in tuna aggregations to other locations  thus depriving our country of one of its main sources of income. Moreover  inshore and traditional fishing  the mainstay of local fishermen and a major source of food  is also highly threatened. Food security on islands is at stake.  The impacts of climate change on the tourism sector are also expected to be significant  and that is why we believe that support for economic diversification towards other revenue-generating sectors in small island States is more than necessary.  Climate change is also a security issue. But it is not merely a matter of narrow national security   it has a new dimension. It is a question of our collective security and responsibility in a fragile and increasingly interdependent world  where the notion of borders has undergone a powerful symbolic transformation.  It is now up to politicians  businessmen and civil society to continue the work accomplished by scientists. The peoples of the world are increasingly looking to their leaders to take action  and the time is now. A week ago  at a meeting of the Global Island Partnership in Rome  our President  James Michel  launched the Sea Level Rise Foundation  as an attempt to ensure that island nations have the capacity to adapt to climate change. Together we are mobilizing leadership  gathering resources and sharing skills  knowledge  technologies and innovation in a cost-effective and sustainable way that will catalyse action for conservation and sustainable livelihoods on islands and low-lying areas in the face of climate change.  We count on the valuable support of the international community for ensuring the success of this noble and important endeavour. We call on the developed countries to take a strong lead and commitment in combating climate change. Aspirational global emissions reduction goals are not sufficient. We believe that the Kyoto Protocol paves the way forward for Annex I countries to fulfil their commitments under UNFCCC. We urge those parties to commit to their legally binding targets and to translate them into concrete actions for the reduction of their gas emissions.  We believe that a United Nations-based multilateral approach that builds on the Kyoto Protocol framework is the only decisive way of moving forward. There cannot be any doubt as to the major importance of the first steps taken at Kyoto and of the quantum improvements brought about by the provisions of the Protocol. The size and urgency of the problem requires that we take bold initiatives and compromises.  However  as the globe suffers because of climate change  it is essential that the international community as a whole be formally and unequivocally reminded that neither the efforts made thus far in implementing UNFCCC  nor the emissions reduction targets  set on average at 5.2 per cent  adopted in Kyoto represent an adequate effort to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at safe levels. We know that we need to do much more. In that regard  we would like to take this opportunity to praise the recent work accomplished by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in urging the need for deeper cuts in greenhouse gasses of 25 per cent to 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020. Moreover  we would like to extend our heartfelt appreciation for the determination shown by our Secretary-General in facilitating the international dialogue to address the problem.  It is now up to us to build the political momentum needed in order to ensure that a comprehensive agreement is met at the world summit on climate change in Bali  Indonesia. There is an urgent need to ensure that developing nations  including small island developing States  can continue to develop and prosper in an equitable manner. Small island developing States need to be equipped financially  technically and technologically to adapt to global climate change and sea level rise without redirecting their limited resources from sustainable development.  Allow me to now turn briefly to other issues that are of particular importance to Seychelles.  First of all  Seychelles recognizes that globalization has the potential to advance human development throughout the world. But it is not automatic  for globalization has also increased our vulnerability  insecurity and the possibility of marginalization.  It is internationally recognized that trade can be an important source of financing for development. In this particular context  Seychelles strongly believes that more emphasis should be placed on the development dimension of small island developing States in multilateral trade negotiations  in recognition of their specificities and structural handicaps. Moreover  in our view  ownership of development orientations by recipient countries is the precondition for the emergence of a true partnership in development cooperation.  Furthermore  it is extremely important that the whole issue of development policies and cooperation be monitored closely within the international system. Decisions affecting development are being taken in different arenas  forums and agencies. Increasingly  there is the need to ensure coherence in policies and programmes. The international system currently does not have an effective mechanism for conducting such an exercise. We reiterate our belief that one of the urgent tasks of the moment is to create a mechanism within the international architecture that will focus on trade  finance  technology and development policy in an integrated manner.  Seychelles remains determined to build its economy based on our assertion of the principle of responsibility for our own development. Our efforts at economic re-engineering have been very dynamic. The Seychelles Strategy 2017 commits the Government of the Republic of Seychelles to doubling the gross domestic product in the next 10 years. The reforms being undertaken will not only ensure that our economy continues to grow but also will facilitate the participation of every Seychellois in wealth creation. That is the commitment of the Government of Seychelles. However  owing to our inherent vulnerabilities  we need the support of the international community in guaranteeing that the considerable successes achieved so far in the economic and social sectors are not lost.  I have spoken thus far on climate and development issues  which are both closely related to other critical areas of the international agenda. One such area concerns peace and security. It is tragic and painful to witness the continued cycle of violence around the world. Peace accords and ceasefire agreements do not  unfortunately  entail a cessation of hostilities.  We support the strong will shown by the United Nations  working alongside the African Union  in ensuring that peace and security are brought to the people in the Darfur region of the Sudan. Seychelles associates itself with all those calling and working for peace in Africa  the Middle East  Asia and elsewhere.  Against the backdrop of increased violence from war and terrorism  it is clear to us that violence and the use of force cannot be the answer. We must embrace multilateralism and insist that international relations be guided by the rule of law as the basis for our collective security.  The United Nations remains a significant partner and interlocutor of the modern development and progress of Seychelles. It is with complete faith  as a small island developing State  that we renew our trust in the principles of the Charter. We cannot stop emphasizing the compelling urgency of altering the design and function of the Security Council  if it is to fulfil the mandate conferred by the Charter of 1945 in the realities of the world today.  With regard to the General Assembly  what is needed is a resuscitation and use of the powers of the General Assembly and the assertion of its role as the principal organ of the United Nations. The Assembly is a forum of equals. Its pronouncements and policy decisions must carry the stamp of legitimacy as the voice of the international community. However  we must emphasize that  irrespective of whatever institutional arrangements we may devise  in the final analysis  it is the commitment and political will among Member States alone that can make the system work. (spoke in French)  In the demanding context of globalization  regions are players with which the multilateral organizations  donors and international investors devote increasingly sustained attention. The regional approach is also the best bastion when it comes to mounting defences against terrorism  insecurity  banditry  trafficking  pandemics  or to providing an efficient response to disasters in real time. A region is  ultimately  for the countries that comprise it  the strongest legal space in which those countries can obtain the natural resources and raw materials that they share.   That is  therefore  the aim of the Indian Ocean Commission  which strives to defend the interests of all countries of the Indian Ocean in all areas. What it represents today and the place that it occupies in the landscape of regional cooperation organizations is due  in large part  to the specialized agencies of the United Nations. I would very much wish for that support to be strengthened in the coming months  so that the Commission truly has the means to achieve its ambitions. The observer status that the Commission obtained in the General Assembly on 4 December 2006 enabled our regional organization to acquire additional legitimacy to work with the specialized agencies of the United Nations. We welcome those new prospects and paths of cooperation.  The future of generations to come rests not so much on the vigour of our debate and the declarations we make in this Assembly at its sixty-second session  but on the action we take. Our people are demanding that  collectively  we emerge with a clear vision  that we display the courage and unrelenting commitment to build a world of peace  justice and equity that we can inhabit together in true harmony. Let us here resolve to build one world where every man  woman and child can realize the true purpose and fulfilment of life. "
"163",6666,"SYR",62,2007,"I would like to congratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session and to wish him every success in his important task. Allow me also to salute his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed  Al-Khalifa of sisterly Bahrain and to express our appreciation of the efforts she deployed to bring the work of that session to a successful conclusion.  I also wish to express to the new Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  our best wishes for success in his noble mission  namely  that of guiding our international Organization towards the realization of the purposes and principles of its Charter.  The Middle East region has been an arena of daunting challenges and heightened tensions owing to the Israeli occupation  since 1967  of Arab territories and to the denial of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. Although this is not a new development  recent challenges and tensions have been escalating and  as such  they not only threaten security and stability throughout the region  but also international peace and security. The hopes of the peoples of the region of achieving a just and comprehensive peace and living in a secure and stable environment have faded  if they have not totally died. Moreover  the current situation in Iraq and the attendant anger and apprehensions it has generated have turned the region into an explosive hotbed of tensions and a theatre of confrontations  instead of allowing it to prosper  pursue its development goals and achieve progress.  May I  therefore  ask what have we accomplished over the past year or during the previous session of the General Assembly in terms of addressing the root causes of tensions plaguing the Middle East region? That situation does not serve the interests of any of the parties  inside or outside the region. The prevailing trends have not changed: Israeli occupation of Arab lands continues  so does the denial of the legitimate rights of Palestinians. One can even say that the support  financing and arming of those policies have continued unabated and have even surpassed previous records. The recently reported figures on the increased United States arming of Israel speak for themselves.  The latest act of aggression against Syria on 6 September 2007 is proof of Israel’s desire to escalate tensions. We reiterate that the failure of the international community  including the Security Council  to condemn that act of aggression will encourage Israel to persist in that hostile pursuit  and will lead to the exacerbation of tensions in the region. Some sources in the United States have spread rumours and fabricated news in order to justify that act of aggression. By distorting the facts they have become Israel’s accomplices in that act.  Addressing and pursuing peace in the Middle East require first and foremost evincing the will to make peace on the basis of law and justice. Regrettably  that will does not factor into the priorities of some of the policies pursued nowadays. The contemplated substance  approach and objectives of an international gathering that seeks to find a comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict remain vague. Furthermore  the proposed gathering fails to identify the purpose  basis  terms of reference and time frame of the process.  Syria has repeatedly stressed and stresses again today that peace is its strategic choice. President Bashar Al-Assad highlighted that fact in the statement he made before the People’s Assembly on 17 July 2007. He stated that Syria is ready for a just and comprehensive peace built on resolutions of international legitimacy  which he deemed to be the prelude to the realization of peace and security in the region. The statement confirms that Syria has the will to make a genuine peace that would recover the rights and return the land to its rightful owners and that would guarantee peace for all. We have repeatedly called for a resumption of the peace process on the basis of the Madrid terms of reference and the principle of land for peace. Let me ask here: does the Israeli Government or the current American administration still have that will  the will to make genuine peace? Regrettably  actions and realities on the ground suggest otherwise.  The current situation in Iraq presages great dangers for Iraq and the region. Addressing that situation requires effective cooperation among all parties inside Iraq  in the region and the world at large. The absence of a genuine political vision for a solution and the exclusive reliance on a military solution further aggravate the situation. We have always stressed the need to preserve the unity of the Iraqi people and the Iraqi land  the non-interference in its internal affairs  the preservation of its sovereignty and independence  its Arab and Islamic identity and the rejection of any claims to divide it. We believe that the solution in Iraq must begin with national reconciliation based on the principle of respect for the will of all segments of the Iraqi people to determine their political future or to lay the foundation for a new Iraq that is built on equal citizenship. We therefore stress the need for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Iraq  in agreement with the Iraqi Government  because that measure will contribute to curbing the violence. We have repeatedly stressed our condemnation of all terrorist acts committed in Iraq that claim the lives of innocent civilians. Occasional allegations that combatants are infiltrating into Iraq through the Syrian-Iraqi border cannot be farther from the truth. They fail to acknowledge the strict measures that Syria has put in place to control those borders. We believe that the purpose of those unfounded accusations is to assign to others the responsibility for the failure of the occupying Power to achieve security and stability in Iraq.  The deteriorating security situation in Iraq has prompted many Iraqis to flee their country. There are over 1.6 million Iraqi refugees in Syria today. In addition to the security and social repercussions associated with their presence  Syria is bearing an enormous financial burden to satisfy their economic needs and to provide them with services. It is regrettable that the international community has failed to discharge its responsibility to assist Iraqi refugees until it becomes safe for them to return to their homes and country. The occupying Power spends hundreds of billions of dollars on military operations inside Iraq  but fails to allocate any resources to assist Iraqis who have been forced out of Iraq as a result of the occupation and its repercussions.  Official visits exchanged between fraternal Iraq and Syria have opened broad horizons for mutual cooperation and have identified the main areas of cooperation at all levels. Syria  for its part  plans to implement all the measures agreed to during those visits.  The critical and sensitive situation in brotherly Lebanon requires that the Lebanese act together in order to emerge from the current state of affairs and arrive at solutions that will serve the interest of Lebanon and its future. Syria has consistently supported all initiatives aimed at activating Lebanese dialogue within the country with a view to arriving at a consensus. We believe that the run-up to the coming presidential elections constitutes a good basis for consensus-building among the Lebanese to elect a president in accordance with constitutional rules  free from foreign intervention and in a manner that would safeguard Lebanon’s interests and its relations with Arab countries.  Syria reaffirms its position calling for the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East region. Allow me to recall that in 2003 Syria tabled a draft resolution before the Security Council on behalf of the Arab Group  and we are still looking forward to its adoption.  I would like to affirm that Syria associates itself with the declared positions of other developing countries  which stress the freedom and the right of all countries to acquire nuclear technologies to use them for peaceful purposes. We believe that it is necessary to compel Israel  the sole party in the region that possesses nuclear weapons  to submit its facilities to the safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement.  Like many others  I wonder whether the world has become safer many years after the beginning of the war on terrorism. The answer is common knowledge. Terrorism has spread to areas that have never known that phenomenon before. Syria believes that fighting terrorism by force alone is useless. We must address the root causes of terrorism and firmly distinguish between combating terrorism and the legitimate right of people to resist foreign occupation. We call on all States to cooperate in the fight against terrorism. At the same time  we warn against using terrorism as a pretext to compromise peoples’ rights and to instil hatred among religions and civilizations instead of promoting intercultural and interreligious dialogues in the interest of humanity at large.  Earlier on in the debate we listened to calls advocating interference in the internal affairs of States under the pretext of defending human rights and promoting democracy. Syria questions the discrepancy between words and actions in Palestine  Iraq  Lebanon and other parts of the world. The inhumane practices we learned of in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and the condoning of Israeli aggression against Lebanon last year and other Israeli practices in Palestine and the Golan constitute grave violations of human rights. That prompts us to question in turn  and rightly so: which human rights are they advocating?  More than ever before our world needs a reaffirmation of our commitment to the principles and purposes of the United Nations  in order to avoid applying double standards and to free the Organization from those few who try to control its decisions and dictate their policies to its organs. The conflicts and crises with which our world is plagued today must prompt us to seek solutions based on enhanced intercultural and interreligious dialogues  and to persevere in our pursuit of the political solutions to current international problems in a manner that would preserve international peace and security. "
"164",6711,"TCD",62,2007,"Please  accept our warm congratulations  Sir  on your well-deserved election to the presidency of our Assembly. We are convinced that you possess all the necessary qualities for the sound direction of our work. My country assures you of its support as you carry out your important task.   We also wish to convey our gratitude to your predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for the efficiency with which she guided the work of our sixty-first session. I also wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to our Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who has been constantly playing a significant role since his election in advancing the ideals of our Organization.   One important event has caught the attention of Chad. On 25 September  the Security Council adopted unanimously resolution 1778 (2007) authorizing an international operation on the eastern border of Chad and the north-east border of the Central African Republic. That operation   and we should stress the defensive nature of its mandate: the protection of refugees  displaced persons  civilian populations and humanitarian workers   is something that in Chad we are very satisfied to see since it will lighten the heavy burden borne thus far by the Chadian local police since the beginning of the crisis in Darfur.   Chad also wishes to thank the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the friendly countries who have supported the local Chadian police. At this point  I wish also to pay tribute to their courage and dedication because they did their best in order to accomplish their sensitive and dangerous mission.   The new operation will be able to rely on the availability and cooperation of Chadian authorities. We venture to hope that it will stabilize and create conditions for the reconstruction of the eastern part of our country  which has been destroyed by incursions of the Janjaweed militias from the Sudan and other armed groups from Darfur. It will also especially require that the Chadian displaced persons  who have so far been neglected by the international community  be reinstalled in their original localities.   Above and beyond our hopes of stabilization and reconstruction in the eastern part of our country  we have the legitimate hope that the Darfur crisis will end. More than any country  Chad would gain by that  especially since our populations in the eastern part of Chad have been the victims of the crisis as often if not more than our sister populations of the Sudan in Darfur. For that reason  our country has tirelessly endeavoured to restore peace and security to Darfur. In that regard  no one can ignore the extremely important role played by the President of the Republic  His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itmo  in supporting the peacekeeping measures taken by the international community.   The Republic of Chad has no intention of departing from that course. For that reason we will make the fullest possible contribution to the success of the resumed inter-Sudanese peace talks on Darfur that are scheduled for Tripoli on 27 October. We have also contributed to the preparation of the peace talks through our participation in meetings bringing together the non-signatory movements of the Abuja Peace Agreement  including meetings at Abeche in Chad  at Asmara in Eritrea  at Tripoli in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and at Arusha in Tanzania  as well as the last Seminar of N’Djaména in Chad   all of which has taken place under the auspices of the joint mediation of the United Nations and the African Union.   We have just underscored our resolve to work for peace in Darfur in particular  and of course  in the Sudan in general  because that work is in the interest of peace and security in the subregion of Central Africa in general and of Chad in particular. We all need peace among our neighbours in order to fend off any risk to the stabilization of our countries and to continue  guided by the inspiration of His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itmo  President of the Republic and Head of State  to build upon the democratic process that our country has been committed to since 1990  as well as to ensure the peace  security and social well-being of the Chadian people.   In that regard  we should highlight that  since last year  Chadian political life has witnessed some positive developments. A number of military and political high officials of the Chadian rebellion have had their legal rights restored  individually or in small groups or with their entire organization.   On 4 March 2007  a new Government was formed under the leadership of one of the well known figures of the political opposition to the presidential majority   Prime Minister Sem Nouradine Delwa Kassire Koumakoye. Moreover  the new Government has responded to the expectations of the opposition by deciding to postpone the legislative and communal elections in order to wait for the conclusions of a political dialogue begun under the auspices of the European Union. That dialogue is aimed at strengthening the rule of law and the democratic process by organizing the elections under conditions that are acceptable to all actors in our political life  or at least by the greater majority  which is devoted to the peaceful settlement of political conflicts and has renounced recourse to weapons and anti-constitutional changes.   That political dialogue led to the signing of a political agreement on 13 August 2007. The signing of that important agreement by the parties of the governmental majority and the democratic opposition clearly stems from the constant resolve of the President of the Republic  His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itmo  to establish a peaceful political life in the country.   Furthermore  we wish also to warmly thank our development partners  in particular the European Union  whose valuable assistance enabled us to produce the agreement that we consider historic. That new fact in Chad’s political life has enabled us to note with great satisfaction that a number of political exiles have returned or intend to return without delay to the country. We owe that situation to the facilitation of the heads of State who are friends of Chad and we mention in particular His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba of Gabon and His Excellency Mr. Boni Yayi of Benin. In addition to the notable progress with the democratic opposition and the Chadian political exiles we note that we are looking forward   with the support of the guide to the Libyan revolution and the mediator of the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States (CEN-SAD)  our brother Muammar Al-Qadhafi   to continuing with the useful discussions taking place in Tripoli with the armed movements aimed at reaching agreements with those organizations that have not yet rejoined the great Chadian family. We hope that those movements will renounce any recourse to weapons and express their expectations within the peaceful framework set by the historic political agreement of 13 August 2007 and with respect for the institutions of the Republic.   It is our view that all political initiatives having to do with national reconciliation should fall within the framework of the political agreement of 13 August and should contribute to strengthening the State apparatus for the benefit of the general interest. For we should not forget that since its independence  Chad has known only conflict or post-conflict situations  often  indeed  internal  but including in particular those fuelled from the outside to weaken the State or to topple the country’s institutions. This is why we count on the international community to unreservedly condemn all attempts to destabilize the Chadian State  and also all who use unconstitutional means  notably force  to seize power. The Chadian people  victims of insecurity due to the interminable armed struggles for power  condemn these sterile struggles and rely on the democratic political actors and on the international community to block the path to violence.  If we must extend a hand to the rebels  whose causes sometimes seem to be from the world of a revolutionary utopia  this should not be done to the detriment of the highest interest of the rule of law and of democracy. Unhappiness is at the heart of rebellions. We find mercenaries in the pay of someone from the exterior  and adventurers who use it as a source of commerce to gain unwarranted material advantages or to satisfy personal ambitions in exchange for their return to legality  in disdain of the authority of the State apparatus  of the law and of the country’s regulations.  After this brief overview of Chadian political questions  allow me to raise some other issues regarding today’s challenges: globalization with its hopes and anguishes  poverty  inequitable international trade  terrorism  the AIDS pandemic  and so forth. A number of international meetings have been held on these topics and on others. Resolutions and recommendations have been adopted. However  no decisive advances have been made in these areas. We can only hope that the international community will honour its commitments and that the richest will keep their promises vis-à-vis the poorest.  We cannot simply ignore another important event  the High-level Event on Climate Change and its consequences  which was held right here. We hope that the international community will learn lessons with a view to acting instead of indulging in fine statements  as was the case after the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto.  Yes  we need to act  and for us the most tragic case deserving the attention of the international community is that of the shrinking of Lake Chad  whose surface has been reduced in a few decades from 25 000 square kilometres to 2 500 square kilometres. Saving Lake Chad would not only contribute to the struggle against disastrous climate change on a planetary level  but would also meet the needs of 25 million people in the countries adjacent to the Lake.  Another issue is just as worrisome  and that is the conflict situations in Africa and on other continents. How can we not take a stand? We applaud the efforts of the African Union (AU) and the United Nations to find lasting solutions to the conflicts in Africa or elsewhere in the world.  This prompts us to underscore the importance of another event that has caught our attention. That is the Security Council meeting held at the level of heads of State on 25 September on the question of peace and security in Africa. We are mindful of the Council’s steadily growing interest in Africa  and that meeting seems to pave the way for the strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations and the AU  especially with a view to building the capacities of the AU so that it can accomplish its peace missions in the best possible conditions. This is the moment to condemn the recent barbarous attacks on the African forces in Darfur and to express our condolences to the families of the missing.  We have great hope for the settlement of all crises in the framework of the rebirth of multilateralism and collective security  which our Secretary-General has very strongly endorsed: hopes for peace in Côte d’Ivoire  in Western Sahara  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  in the Horn of Africa  in the Middle East and so forth.  Before I conclude  I would like to recall that we have constantly condemned before this Assembly all forms of violence and intolerance  especially their most extreme form   terrorism. We reaffirm our condemnation and our commitment to fighting these phenomena. We would like to reaffirm our commitment to strive to eliminate all sources of conflicts and all the threats that jeopardize peace and security around the world.  In this regard  I wish to recall the need to respect the principles of peaceful coexistence  which are respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States. This  of course  prompts us to reaffirm our devotion to respect for internationally recognized historical borders. We cite as an example our attachment to the policy of a single China and our opposition to Taiwan’s attempts to bring about a kind of accession to the United Nations  under whatever name they might choose.  This also prompts us to express respect for the sovereign right of States to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. And we welcome the good arrangements to find solutions to the question of nuclear energy through negotiations and to find a peaceful solution to the problem of the dissemination of weapons of mass destruction.  This last prompts us once again to launch a pressing appeal to our Assembly  especially to the permanent members of the Security Council  to redress the injustice of the African continent being the only continent that does not have a permanent member seat on the Council  when the bulk of the Council’s agenda is comprised of African situations. "
"165",6757,"TGO",62,2007,"Each  session of the General Assembly offers us an opportunity to meet in order to take stock of our actions and define the necessary perspectives for breathing new life into our Organization. In analysing events throughout the world during the past year  we should note that despite the efforts of the international community the situation is far from satisfactory. Indeed  international peace and security are still seriously threatened due to persistent conflicts   in particular in Africa  the Middle East and Iraq   while the risks of terrorist aggression are far from being eliminated.   In economic terms  the situation   overshadowed by extreme poverty and endemic diseases continues to be a source of serious concern for the majority of the countries of the planet who are considered to be the poorest. Likewise  natural disasters caused by climate change are a constant challenge to the human conscience  to the point of wondering whether the international community will be able to find appropriate and lasting solutions.  The state of our world today should inspire us to redouble our efforts in order to give real meaning to international solidarity. It should above all incite the international community and Member States collectively and individually to seek with determination ways and means not only to ensure the prosperity of their national populations but also to reduce  at least somewhat  extreme poverty in the world.  Before continuing my speech  I wish to add my voice to those of previous speakers and to express my warm congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. He may count on the support of Togo in discharging his high functions throughout the term  which I hope will be fruitful. I wish to once again express my congratulations to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his outstanding election to the post of Secretary-General of our Organization. I am certain his great wealth of diplomatic experience will make it possible for the United Nations to strengthen its actions in order to achieve a fairer and more democratic world in which each country will be able to exist in freedom.  With regard to Togo  after several years of the democratization process which unfortunately has not been smooth  the country today is now moving beyond the lack of understanding and intolerance among its sons and daughters. To consolidate our achievements we have endeavoured to find appropriate solutions for the concerns of the people by implementing a policy on national reconstruction which will value all Togolese without exclusion. Aware that the peace and economic development that we want for our country cannot be achieved without the effective participation of the population in managing public affairs  we have spared no effort to involve the Togolese political class in a national dialogue in order to overcome their bitterness  to restore confidence and to devote our energies to national construction. That ambition is possible only if we strive to strengthen Togolese democracy each day   a democracy based upon an integral multiparty system and a State based on democratic law.  Very soon  on 14 October 2007  Togolese democracy will become consolidated with the election of deputies to the National Assembly  an assembly within which we dare to hope that most of the political forces within the country will be represented. Those upcoming legislative elections  whose successful outcomes will be possible   thanks not only to the political maturity of the Togolese people   but also to the support throughout the electoral process of friendly countries and international institutions; its resulting selection is an inevitable event and will be a decisive turning point in the history of Togo.  The Togolese Government in turn will spare no effort  nor will it skimp on expenses  to ensure that the elections take place in strict transparency and the will of the people as expressed by the ballot box is fully respected. With that goal in mind  the population will  for the first time  vote with secure voter cards with photographs and the whole system will be supported by a reliable electoral roll. Our greatest hope is that those elections will give an opportunity to the people of Togo to reconcile and an opportunity for the country to resume its place within the family of nations. For that reason  I wish to take the opportunity now to repeat my Government’s gratitude to the international community   in particular the Economic Community of West African States  the African Union  the countries of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific  the European Union  the International Organization of la Francophonie  France  Germany  the People’s Republic of China  the United States and all the other States   for the unwavering support which they continue to give to Togo throughout these crucial times.   Of course  we cannot forget the United Nations  which  through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  has played an essential role since the start of our democratic process  and more specifically  in the preparation for these elections. These elections  which are to be held on 14 October  are due to a great extent on the facilitator chosen unanimously by the political forces   I appointed Blaise Compaoré  President of Burkina Faso and current Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).   Establishment of the rule of law requires dignified and loyal conduct from its citizens based on the respect of the noble ideals that underpin the Republic and promote progress in society. It also requires bold measures from leaders aimed at promoting national peace and harmony.  In this respect and to take into account commitments undertaken through the Global Political Agreement  our Togolese Government is determined to establish in the near future the two Commissions provided for under the Agreement  namely  the Commission to Investigate Acts of Political Violence Committed in the Past and to Study Methods for Compensation for Victims and the Commission to Propose Measures to Promote Forgiveness and National Reconciliation. The Constitutional Court  one of whose missions is to deal with electoral disputes  was set up on 20 September after its reconstitution in accordance with the wish of the political class as expressed during the national dialogue.  These measures  together with all the other actions that the Government carries out every day  are part of our will to ban political violence and combat impunity  in all sincerity  pragmatism and discernment.  A national programme to combat impunity has already been set up and the first awareness activities have been carried out with success throughout the country over a period of a month and a half. This programme  which is aimed at helping to develop conditions conducive to the birth of a democratic spirit  is supported by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights created in Togo  and we are pleased to express our appreciation of its efficient role in strengthening governmental action.  The problems of peace  security and the building of a democratic State based on the rule of law and the sustainable development of Togo can only be grasped by taking into account the economic realities of the country. Indeed  the Togolese economy has suffered a great deal from disruption of external assistance from its traditional partners since 1993. This absence of external assistance has certainly had a negative impact on social programmes and development programmes designed by the Government and has seriously eroded public infrastructure and has delayed measures aimed at good economic governance. This situation has slowed the efforts of the Government to improve the living conditions of the Togolese  more than 60 per cent of whom still live below the poverty threshold. How can our collective conscience remain indifferent in the face of such a situation?  Giving this alarming observation  we feel that Togo should be able to benefit from special assistance  which would allow it to raise its economic level and to bolster  as a result  its young democracy. I should thus like to make an urgent appeal to all of our development partners that they decide to support our efforts in the face of the major challenges before us. The assistance that we are requesting and the Togolese Government’s own efforts will allow my country to work towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).   The maintenance of international peace and security remains a prerequisite for any development process. Togo thus reaffirms its devotion to the ideals of peace  security and stability  both within and outside of States. My country feels that threats to peace and security on the African continent require that the United Nations become more involved than it has so far.  However  I am pleased to pay tribute to the role that has been played and continues to be played by the Organization in Africa with regard to the restoration of peace and security in certain countries  particularly in Liberia  Sierra Leone  Guinea-Bissau and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  We also feel that Chad  Burundi and the Central African Republic should benefit from firm actions for peace and security in order to put an end to acts of violence and to consolidate peace  democracy and political stability in these countries.   As regards Côte d’Ivoire  my country is pleased to note that  despite the delay in the implementation of the United Nations road map  the peace process has reached a key phase with the signing of the Ouagadougou peace agreement on 4 March 2007  the lighting of the flame of peace on 30 July 2007 and the announcement of the presidential election in the next few months.  As regards Sudan  Togo welcomes the adoption on 31 July 2007 by the Security Council of resolution 1769 (2007) on the deployment in Darfur of a hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force. We hope that the international community will do everything in its power to ensure that the necessary logistical and financial means are made available for this mission.  My country also urges the other rebel factions that did not participate in the Arusha discussions in August 2007 to join the negotiating process in order to reach a comprehensive peace agreement.  As regards Somalia  Togo makes an appeal to the international community that it become more involved  together with the African Union  so that a peacekeeping force can be deployed there.  Beyond Africa  our eyes turn constantly to Iraq and the Middle East  still in the grips of violence. As regards the Middle East  Togo supports the idea of organizing an international conference under the aegis of the Quartet in order to restart the process of direct and constructive negotiations. From this viewpoint  Israelis and Palestinians should be encouraged to persevere with dialogue in order to achieve a comprehensive and lasting settlement  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.   However  the prerequisite for any negotiation between the two parties lies in the need to see all of the Palestinian elements overcome their internal differences.   In the area of disarmament and the control of weapons of mass destruction  Togo welcomes the beginnings of a resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue with the historic agreement concluded between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the international community. In the same vein  as regards the question of the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran  my country calls on the interested parties to pursue and give priority to talks  in order to achieve a negotiated solution that takes into account the interests of the parties involved.  With respect to light weapons  Togo expresses the hope that this session of the General Assembly will undertake strong commitments in order to strengthen efforts aimed at negotiating a treaty on trade in light weapons similar to what was done by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).   With respect to terrorism  which is also an obstacle to sustainable development  my country believes that  following the momentum that led to the adoption of the global strategy to combat this scourge  it is essential that we make universal and improve the international legal framework to combat terrorism.   In this respect  the rapid conclusion of negotiations relating to the draft global convention to combat international terrorism would be welcome and would serve the interests of all countries and all peoples.   It is disturbing to note that today’s new economic order continues to produce a society where profit for profit’s sake and inequalities of all kinds reign. The solidarity which we have so keenly advocated in the United Nations has yet to be realized. At the very least  we can say is that this situation penalizes the economies of developing countries  which  due to globalization  are frequently obliged to open their markets against their own interests.  That is why we think that development  generally speaking  should take place at the global level. From this viewpoint  all countries should honour their commitments related to the establishment of a global partnership aimed at promoting equitable and sustainable development for all.   Thus  Togo appeals once again to the international community  in particular to the developed countries  that they increase their development assistance and promote international trade and direct foreign investment  particularly towards poor countries. It is also essential to focus seriously on the urgent question of debt and to resume the Doha negotiations so that trade liberalization will promote the development of all nations  particularly the poorest among them.  In this respect  we commend the commitments undertaken at the Group of Eight Summit  held in June 2007 in Germany  to support the facilitation of economic growth and investment  including microfinance; to support the establishment or strengthening of development institutions in the private sector and structural reform which will improve the economic environment; and to support efforts in the areas of health  in particular the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis.  The high-level debates which the General Assembly held on 24 September once more illustrated the fact that one of the major challenges that the international community must immediately tackle remains climate change  which is the source of numerous natural disasters.  Togo  which  like many other countries on the continent  has just experienced serious and deadly floods  firmly believes that it is urgent that concrete actions be undertaken to begin a determined and concerted struggle against environmental degradation. It seems to us that the survival of planet Earth is at stake.  The irreplaceable and unparalleled role of the United Nations in international relations should encourage us to reform this institution in the light of present reality. However  we should not lose sight of the fact that the reform of the Organization should reflect the principles of the sovereign equality of States and equitable geographical distribution and should help to strengthen cooperation on an equal footing among States. It should also be based on the principle of broad international consensus  particularly when it involves issues involving the responsibility of all of the Organization’s constituent parts.  That is why Security Council reform must guarantee that all regions of the world be represented within that organ and enable developing countries  which play an important role in accomplishing the tasks of the Organization  to make their contribution  no matter how modest  to promoting peace worldwide.  We hope that the present session of the General Assembly will bring hope to the international community  and particularly to the African peoples  who are waiting to see improvement in their living conditions and lives through decisive and tangible actions.  In order to attain the objectives that we have set for ourselves  in particular during the Millennium Summit  it is essential that we honour all of our commitments within their time frames and that we assume additional commitments in order to bring about a world free of fear  hunger  extreme poverty and disease   a world where we will be able to live in security.  Togo  in its determination to construct a State based on the rule of law and to improve the living conditions of its population  will spare no effort in carrying out its obligations. It hopes it can count on the assistance of the international community in order to do this. "
"166",6802,"THA",62,2007,"On behalf of the Royal Thai Government  allow me first to congratulate you  Mr. President  and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on your election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. The Thai delegation looks forward to rendering its full support for the work of this session in the coming months.  I also wish to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless devotion to the United Nations and its reform. The first year in office is crucial for setting the priorities and future direction of this Organization  and the Secretary-General is certainly faced with a great challenge.  Thailand is keen to work with the Secretary-General towards a renewed United Nations   one that is more responsive and empowered to address effectively the needs of the peoples of our world. We are keen to do so because we are committed to what the United Nations stands for: respect for equality  for diversity  for human rights and for people.  That commitment drives us to build a stronger democracy that is more transparent and has stronger safeguards for our people. That commitment also guides us in building a sound  open economy and a more just and equitable society governed by the rule of law   crucial underpinnings for sustainable development.  All of that is taking place during a very special year for the Thai people  namely  the eightieth birthday of His Majesty the King of Thailand.  As most representatives probably know  exactly one year has passed since Thailand moved to address the unprecedented political paralysis in our democratic system. I wish to take this opportunity to assure our friends that we are keeping to the timeline for the revitalization of parliamentary democracy  with general elections scheduled for 23 December 2007.  Exactly 10 years ago  Thailand suffered from a deep crisis of a different nature. Through globalization  that economic ailment quickly spread to many countries and regions. Yet we have emerged from the 1997 Asian financial crisis a stronger and more vibrant free-market economy. Now  despite high oil prices and other challenges  Thailand’s economic fundamentals are strong.  But  while continued economic growth over the past decade has lifted millions of Thais out of poverty  some 10 per cent have not benefited. Thailand  like other developing countries  continues to face challenges to sustainable development in the form of income disparities and an urban/rural divide.  I believe that governments have a moral responsibility to address disparities in income distribution. This is why Thailand has made it our national priority to promote growth with equity and to achieve development from within. Our approach has been based on His Majesty the King’s philosophy of a “sufficiency economy”  which calls for moderation and mindfulness in consumption  prudent economic decision-making and careful risk management. The philosophy’s recognition by the United Nations Development Programme in its 2007 Thailand Human Development Report has strengthened our conviction that we are on the right track.  The Government is leading that effort through universal education and investing in basic infrastructure for people-centred development. We believe that emphasis on moderation and knowledge will lead to a more equitable society  which is fundamental to sustainable development and immunity from external shocks.  In addition to promoting growth with equity  governments must also ensure that progress does not come at the expense of the environment. For Thailand  the sufficiency economy’s concepts of moderation and mindfulness relate directly to the sustainable utilization of natural resources. Thailand aims at cutting back on its reliance on fossil fuels and at lowering greenhouse gas emissions through energy conservation.  At the same time  we seek to meet our growing energy demand through renewable energy and biofuels. We are also considering the option of nuclear energy  paying heed to the crucial issue of safety.  But Thailand realizes that a significant reduction of fossil fuel use will likely take a few more decades  owing to the high costs of new technology. There must be greater partnership between countries that have developed clean energy technologies and those who lack them. We therefore reiterate our call for research and development cooperation and the affordable transfer of clean coal and methane reduction technologies.  An inevitable consequence of climate change is unpredictability of the water supply. As a major food-producing country  and in line with His Majesty the King’s “Water is life” initiative  water conservation is a long-term priority for the Thai Government. We have made a commitment to increasing the country’s forested and water catchment areas. I would like to call on all nations to make water management a priority on our climate change agenda as well.  Thailand places great importance on promoting human security and is an active member of the Human Security Network. I have spoken about Thailand’s efforts to provide our people with freedom from want through democratic reform  respect for human rights and people-centred and sustainable development. The other side of human security is freedom from fear. As a result of fear and mistrust  individuals and communities fall prey to extremist ideas that further divide humanity. I strongly believe that the best strategy to conquer such fear is winning hearts and minds  and Thailand is committed to fostering cross-cultural understanding.  But terrorism continues to draw its strength from extremist ideologies. So we must appeal to the majority in the world who are moderates to join forces against extremism. In addition  enhancing inter- and intra-faith dialogue and dialogue among civilizations should take place at the regional level. We are doing that in South-East Asia.  As a neighbouring country sharing a land border of more than 2 400 kilometres with Myanmar and currently hosting more than a million of its citizens  Thailand is gravely concerned about what we are seeing and hearing about in Myanmar. Thailand and Myanmar  being predominantly Buddhist  share a belief in non-violence and tolerance. Thailand therefore finds unacceptable the commission of violence and bodily harm to Buddhist monks and other demonstrators in Yangon.  This morning  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) discussed the situation in Myanmar. ASEAN is appalled to have received reports of the use of automatic weapons and demands that the Myanmar Government immediately desist from the use of violence against demonstrators. ASEAN expressed revulsion over reports that demonstrations in Myanmar are being suppressed by violent force and that there have been a number of fatalities. We strongly urge Myanmar to exercise the utmost restraint  to seek a political solution and resume its efforts aimed at national reconciliation with all parties concerned  and to work towards a peaceful transition to democracy. We call for the release of all political detainees  including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.  ASEAN fully supports the decision of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to send Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari to Myanmar. We ask the Myanmar Government to cooperate fully and to work with him. Mr. Gambari’s role as a neutral interlocutor among all the parties can help to defuse the dangerous situation. ASEAN urges Myanmar to grant him full access to all parties in the country  as it has done in the past.  Thailand is undergoing changes that will make it a more capable partner of the international community and the United Nations. At the regional level  Thailand is eager to work with our ASEAN partners to create a closer community. Strengthened by a new Charter  ASEAN will be able to cooperate more effectively with its United Nations partners.   Indeed  promoting closer cooperation between ASEAN and the United Nations   two organizations that share the same values and goals   will be one contribution to restoring faith in the multilateral system. Another will be supporting ongoing United Nations reform efforts. Together with Chile  South Africa and Sweden  Thailand has put forth the Four Nations Initiative proposals  aimed at improving the governance and management of the Secretariat on the basis of increased accountability and transparency.  Thailand’s cooperation with the international community and the United Nations is being further enhanced by new people-centred initiatives. Our new constitution provides for universal education and health care  gender equality  respect for children’s rights and a social safety net for the poor  the disabled and the elderly. More than ever before  we are committed to combating HIV/AIDS and other global health threats.  In the area of poverty eradication  Thailand is also committed to going beyond our borders to assist our friends and neighbours. Our Mae Fah Luang Foundation’s community development model is being replicated in Afghanistan and Indonesia. Thai troops participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions are recognized for their contributions in rebuilding basic infrastructures in post-conflict areas.  We see that the immediate resumption of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations is essential to help the developing world achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). And  as the twelfth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  to be held in Accra next year  approaches  Thailand is looking forward to discussing ideas for South-South and trilateral cooperation to address the opportunities and challenges of globalization for development.  This has been a year of great reform for Thailand. The current political and social reforms that are taking place in my country will allow us to make greater contributions to a world where people can live in security and dignity  free from poverty and despair   a world where the present generation enhances the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  As the world grows smaller by the day  humanity  more than ever before  is sharing a common destiny. Our faith in the United Nations and in the multilateral process must be equal to the challenges and opportunities facing us. "
"167",6827,"TJK",62,2007,"First  of all  I would like to join in the sincere congratulations on your election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session and wish you every success in this lofty office. I would also like to avail myself to this opportunity to express gratitude to your predecessor  Her Excellency Mrs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for her selfless and efficient work during the sixty-first session. We also join in the words of welcome addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Ban Ki-moon.  Tajikistan welcomes the continued reforms of the United Nations structure and enhancement of its activities aimed at strengthening peace and international security  furthering the promotion of human rights  expanding its humanitarian mission  placing the problem of climate change as an issue of top priority and addressing today’s other challenges. We believe that further progress in dealing with these issues of global importance is dependent on joint  concerted and consistent actions of the entire international community.  Tajikistan attaches primary importance to the further strengthening of the disarmament process  the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  the speedy entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and activation of negotiations on the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. In cooperation with other Central Asian States  Tajikistan took a very active part in the drafting of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone in Central Asia  which was signed on 8 September 2006 in Semipalatinsk  and in the adoption of the relevant General Assembly resolution (A/Res/61/88) last year.  It is common knowledge that international terrorism  transnational organized crime and illicit drug trafficking have become a serious obstacle on the road towards sustainable development  inflicting much suffering and causing trouble to humanity. The international community should intensify its efforts aimed at counteracting the commission of acts of terror and the proliferation of ideologies based on terrorism  extremism and separatism  interreligious and inter-ethnic intolerance and hostility  and should enhance its struggle against the financing of terrorism.  The global system of combating terrorism  which is currently taking shape  cannot be established without the involvement of regional and subregional organizations. In our region  the Commonwealth of Independent States  the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization are serving this purpose.  We believe that long-term success in combating terrorism and religious extremism depends on eliminating the root causes of these negative phenomena associated with social and economic problems within society. It is essential to jointly search for ways of addressing poverty issues  overcoming negative consequences of globalization  and resolving internal and regional conflicts. Actions based on force alone will not be able to uproot terrorism.  Regrettably  today  we witness the merging of terrorism with transnational organized crime and the drug trade  which gives rise to our shared and justifiable concern. Prevention of illicit drug trafficking  which  to a certain extent  is the breeding ground for terrorism and international crime  should become part and parcel of our common struggle against terrorism. In this regard  I would like to reiterate Tajikistan’s willingness to continue constructive dialogue and cooperation with the aim of establishing an effective global partnership for counteracting the narcotics threat.  An international conference dedicated to the tenth anniversary of the signing of the General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan was held in Dushanbe in June 2007  in cooperation with the United Nations. Almost simultaneously  the United Nations Tajikistan Office of Peacebuilding successfully concluded its activities. Moreover  for the first time  the citizens of my country joined international United Nations peacekeeping operations. These events provide convincing proof that the United Nations has the capacity to assist in reaching a peace and in ensuring further sustainable development in a country that has lived through serious internal conflict.  For Tajikistan  like for most United Nations Member States  the achievement of sustainable development is a high priority goal. Within the United Nations framework  much has been accomplished the world over in order to promote sustainable development and to alleviate poverty  epidemics  famine and illiteracy. Meanwhile  the implementation of a large-scale programme on the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will require not only extra effort but also additional resources. Tajikistan’s intention is to realize the greatest possible progress in the implementation of the MDGs. The main purpose of the National Strategy for Development of the Republic of Tajikistan up to the year 2015 and the Strategy for Poverty Reduction in Tajikistan for the years 2007-2009 is to ensure stable economic development and to provide a better standard of living for the country’s population.  It is also obvious that the attainment of the MDGs  to a large extent  also depends on the attitude of the international community when it comes to rendering assistance to developing countries and on the timely mobilization of internal and external resources. With this in mind  Tajikistan joins the appeal addressed to the donor community to at least double the amount of assistance targeted for development. The proposal to pardon the debts incurred by developing countries in exchange for the implementation of national projects aimed at sustainable development remains equally important. In this connection  we attach much significance to the unification of efforts aimed at supporting sustainable financing for development  first and foremost  in the interests of attaining the MDGs. We are in favour of a joint search for effective and feasible development financing mechanisms. Partial writing off of debts could be equally important  since it would make it possible to invest liberated funds into education  environmental protection  combating HIV/AIDS and other MDGs.  Tajikistan wholeheartedly supports the creation of a mechanism of additional measures aimed at making further progress in the realization of the right to development  as enshrined in the Declaration on the Right to Development. Among the issues that should be regarded as associated with that right are the rational usage of natural resources for the purpose of development  provision for the well-being of the population and addressing the problems of poverty and unemployment.  In that connection  Tajikistan believes it has the right to develop the hydropower sector of the economy by building water reservoirs and dams on the major rivers of the country  because sustainable development  improved living standards of the population  achievement of the MDGs  the provision of reliable regulated irrigation water flows and an increased production of electrical energy depend on the availability of hydropower resources. Not only is the implementation of hydropower projects in Tajikistan extremely advantageous for the country itself  but it will also be able to influence favourably the sustainable development of the other States of the region. For instance  the completion of the construction of the Ragun hydropower station in Tajikistan alone will make it possible to supply an extra three million hectares of land with water in the neighbouring Central Asian states. Only an integrated approach towards the use of hydropower and other natural resources of the region  based on the principles of mutual understanding  assistance and trust among the States of the region  can ensure sustainable development in the region and promote a resolution of environmental problems  which are closely interconnected with the rational use of those resources.  Tajikistan is interested in getting support and establishing a partnership with countries and international organizations in the field of renewable sources of energy and energy-efficient technologies  which help to reduce the usage of other traditional types of energy that negatively affect our climate and do enormous damage to the environment and to the future of humanity.  Tajikistan welcomes the High-Level Event on Climate Change held recently in New York and the forthcoming conference on the same subject to be held in Bali in December 2007.  Within the context of global warming  degradation of glaciers and the snow cover on the territories of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan  which are the upper watershed zones of Central Asia’s rivers  has become an ever increasing concern for the Central Asian region. According to various sources  over the last 10 years the area of glaciers in Tajikistan has decreased by 30 to 35 per cent. Although supplying the population with drinking water is being discussed at the top level  and the fact that numerous declarations and other international instruments have already been adopted on this issue  the situation remains urgent. The solution of the problem requires further coordinated efforts on behalf of countries and international organizations. This problem is not only addressed in the Millennium Development Goals  but it is also ranked among those challenges that the world community encounters on a daily basis.  For this reason  the implementation of the International Decade for Action “Water for Life”  proclaimed by the United Nations on the initiative of the Republic of Tajikistan  is regarded as even more timely and appropriate. As part of the Decade  the Government of Tajikistan has planned an international conference for 2008 in Dushanbe on water-related natural disasters  to be held in cooperation with United Nations agencies and other international organizations. Tajikistan hopes that all United Nations Member States will participate actively in this conference.  From time immemorial the water originating in Tajikistan has quenched the thirst of all nations of Central Asia and has irrigated the dry steppes of the region. However  it is obvious that the region has already been experiencing water-related difficulties that can become more aggravated on a yearly basis. To address this urgent problem  Tajikistan proposes to provide the Central Asian States with environmentally sound freshwater from Lake Sarez  which is located at a height of almost 3 300 metres above sea level and which could provide freshwater to half the population of Central Asia. The implementation of this initiative would make it possible to eliminate the real threat of an overflow of Lake Sarez  which could affect millions of people who reside in the downstream areas in neighbouring countries.  As for the development of trade and economic cooperation with other countries  the major challenge that Tajikistan is facing in this area is lack of access to the sea and other transportation and communication difficulties. For this reason  Tajikistan is committed to the decisions and recommendations outlined in the Almaty Programme of Action for transit transport cooperation  which addresses the special needs of landlocked developing countries to efficiently use the available transport infrastructure and to increase transit capacity in order to encourage development of trade and the advancement of investments in Central Asia.  The rehabilitation process in Afghanistan is creating favourable conditions for cooperation in the region in the implementation of transportation and communication projects aimed at gaining access to southern sea ports. The creation of new multi-optional transport corridors and the restoration of the Great Silk Road routes seek to establish a unified interconnected system of communications and to provide the Central Asian States with reliable access to promising markets. The August opening of the bridge across the Pyandj River between Tajikistan and Afghanistan was among the practical measures taken to achieve that goal.  The magnitude of the challenges facing the international community requires the further strengthening of our Organization. There is no doubt that all of us must do our utmost to make the United Nations even more effective in addressing current issues. For that reason  we believe that all of us must shoulder our responsibilities towards the Organization  in the interests of all Member States. "
"168",6849,"TKM",62,2007,"On behalf of the people and the Government of Turkmenistan  I wish to express my good wishes to all members and to congratulate them on the beginning of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.  Let me take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon on his election to the post of Secretary-General and to wish him every success in discharging his challenging responsibilities.  I should also like to congratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of the Assembly. I am certain that under his guidance  the work of the Assembly will be effective and fruitful.   Since the very first days of its independence  Turkmenistan has considered the ideals of the United Nations to be fully in accordance with our aspirations in terms of relations with the international community. The basic principles of the Organization   the maintenance of peace  equality of rights  respect for the sovereignty of all States and their right to choose their own path of development   formed the basis for our country’s foreign policy  in which cooperation with the United Nations has become a priority area.  Time has proved that the choice made by our country was right and well founded. In 15 years of intense cooperation with the United Nations  Turkmenistan has found its own place in the international arena and has gained invaluable experience in interacting with the world community and developing harmonious  equal and mutually respectful relations with other nations. We have every right to be proud of the fact that it was within these walls that resolution 50/80 [A]  on the permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan  was adopted on 12 December 1995   a historic event for our country. It is not an exaggeration to say that the resolution on neutrality has become the foundation of our foreign policy and has played a major role in shaping our national policy.  Cooperation with the United Nations will continue to drive our foreign policy. Here  I should like to emphasize that such cooperation enriches our bilateral and multilateral ties and makes them more meaningful. That is most apparent in regional matters  where the participation of the United Nations and its specialized agencies promotes convergence of States’ approaches to issues  thus creating a favourable political  diplomatic and legal environment for their resolution through concerted effort.  In that context  I consider the recent decision to establish a United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy in Central Asia to be a major milestone. I am confident that the inauguration of the Centre  set for the end of the year  will mark an entirely new phase in the efforts of our country and our neighbours to ensure peace  security and stability in the region.  Turkmenistan is fully prepared to engage in constructive and fruitful cooperation with the Centre. We are certain that its work will be a strong and positive force in resolving the problems faced by our region. We highly appreciate the decision to establish the Centre in Ashgabat  capital of neutral Turkmenistan. We see that as an expression of the Organization’s confidence in our country. Mindful of our great responsibility  I assure the Assembly that our country will do everything necessary to make the Centre’s work effective and fruitful.  Notwithstanding current changes in the world  the great humanist ideals of the United Nations and the principles of its Charter should continue to serve as the moral and legal pillar of the international order. Only on this basis can the issues of United Nations reform be considered. United Nations reform as a whole should be meaningful and goal-oriented and correspond to the objective realities of the age. In this respect  Turkmenistan supports the efforts of the United Nations Member States and the Secretary-General to make the work of the Organization more dynamic  efficient  transparent and democratic.  In that context  Turkmenistan shares the view that it is necessary to improve further the structure of the Security Council and to develop closer and more effective interaction between the Security Council and the General Assembly. We are in favour of reforming the United Nations  making it stronger  enhancing its work and expanding the role and functions of the Security Council as a guarantor of international peace  security and stability.  Turkmenistan’s neutral status  its foreign policy doctrine of non-affiliation with any blocs and its rejection of the use of force as a means of resolving international disputes predetermine our stance with regard to the issues of peace and security. In this context  Turkmenistan fully supports international efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  their delivery systems and related technologies. Accordingly  Turkmenistan has been taking and will continue to take consistent practical steps to ensure implementation of the international legal framework on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In its legislation  Turkmenistan proclaims its refusal to possess  manufacture  store or transport nuclear  chemical  bacteriological and other types of weapons of mass destruction or related technologies. In 2005  the People’s Council of Turkmenistan decided to adopt a Statement on Supporting the Initiatives of International Organizations to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Last year  in Semipalatinsk  Turkmenistan  together with other States of the region  signed the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. That document is unique in many ways  since  for the first time since the Second World War  it proclaims the establishment of a vast region free of nuclear weapons on the map of the northern hemisphere. It is noteworthy that our joint initiative echoes the aspirations of the majority of countries and that it has been highly acclaimed by the international community and endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly. Let me take this opportunity to express our appreciation to all States  international and regional organizations that have supported the document.  However  we need to realize that Central Asia is not isolated. Our region has thousands of historical  ethnic and humanitarian ties with neighbouring States. In this context  Turkmenistan’s concern with the events in Afghanistan is justified. We rejoice at the success of the Afghan people in building a peaceful life; we feel the difficulties they face as our own. Turkmenistan is assisting Afghanistan in rebuilding its economy  by providing professional training  in the construction of social facilities and by providing oil and power to some provinces of the country. Together with the international community  and with the United Nations  we are striving to help achieve stability for Afghanistan and to help the brotherly people of that country to achieve peace and well-being.  Geographically  Turkmenistan is conveniently located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Over its years of independence  our country has built a modern transportation and communication infrastructure. As an important element of international trade and economic relations  it may also become a factor leading to significant revitalization and further development of cultural interaction between the regions  thus promoting rapprochement and mutual understanding between nations. It is in that spirit that Turkmenistan defines its international energy strategy  aimed at developing a multiple pipeline system to bring Turkmen energy resources to international markets on a stable and long-term basis. This strategy is not dependent on either political circumstances or any kind of ideological bias. Our stand on this matter is a stand of principle and full transparency. We support the implementation of economically justified pipeline projects that would guarantee security  including environmental safety. That will determine their multi-track character. In this context  Turkmenistan is in favour of the mutually advantageous use of energy resources by both exporters and consumers.  From this point of view  we are convinced that the implementation of projects aimed at bringing Turkmen energy to international markets will provide another impulse to stimulate inter-State and interregional trade and economic relations. That will also serve to promote further economic growth in the countries where pipelines run and assist in the resolution of issues relating to the provision of light and heat  the development of production and social infrastructure and job creation  which will  ultimately  have a positive effect on the overall political climate within and beyond the region.  Turkmenistan is taking very seriously the issue of environmental protection and a whole range of other issues that will have to be addressed by engaging the capacity of the international community at large. In this context  we support the efforts of the Secretary-General to promote and develop broad international cooperation  with a view to finding a comprehensive solution to this global problem. To that end  Turkmenistan is taking specific steps at the national level. Up to 200 million dollars are annually earmarked in the national budget for environmental protection. Our country has passed legislation setting standards to prevent environmental pollution  and it is introducing technologies to ensure environmental safety of our key sector  the oil and gas industry. Already for over 10 years  Turkmenistan has been implementing a large-scale nation-wide programme entitled “The Green Belt”  which has resulted in millions of trees being planted on thousands of hectares all over the country.  We are fully committed to the goals of the Kyoto Protocol  and we are ready to cooperate with all international partners in implementing its provisions.  As a full-fledged member of the international community  Turkmenistan is developing a genuinely democratic and legal foundation for its national statehood. The greatest value of our society is the individual  and his or her rights and freedoms. Today  this is at the centre of our State policy.  Processes aimed at the further democratization of public and political life  the establishment of civil society  the introduction of modern electoral mechanisms and the formation of local government bodies are gaining momentum. A constructive innovative search for a reasonable balance between the authority of the State and society at large is under way. We are not trying to speed up the process  and we are not pushing it into some artificial time frame. The most important thing is that it has become irreversible and is receiving recognition and support both within and outside the country. And  in this respect  we highly appreciate the assistance provided to us by international organizations in general and by the United Nations in particular.  Today  Turkmenistan is open to the world; it is open to broad-scale partnership in all areas of activity. Together with the rest of the community of nations  our country is ready to work further to promote the principles of international law and the ideals of humanism  justice  tolerance and mutual respect as determinant factors in modern relations among States.  The status of permanent neutrality not only imposes on our country important foreign policy obligations but also obliges us to shape our foreign and social policies accordingly. In that context  I would like to emphasize that Turkmenistan’s neutrality is irreversible and that our commitment to the resultant international obligations is firm. We intend to follow this path with resolve  and we will always be open to international cooperation promoting implementation of the strategic priorities of the community of nations. "
"169",6862,"TLS",62,2007,"As I address this body  may I seize this opportunity to extend to Mr. Kerim my sincere and warm congratulations on his well-deserved election to preside over the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.  In view of the constraints of time and in deference to all  I shall take no more than 10 minutes to share some facts and reflections on the situation in my country  as well as on select issues of regional and international concern.  Timor-Leste is encouraged by Secretary-General’s organization of the high-level event on climate change  to be followed by negotiations on the United Nations Framework Convention in Bali. The industrialized countries of the North bear enormous responsibility for the damage done to our fragile ecosystems. They  more than anyone else  must reverse the course and lead the effort to save the Earth. However  we in the developing world cannot escape our own responsibilities. The demographic explosion and our own efforts to catch up with the rich North all contribute to the pressures on our lands  forests  rivers  lakes and oceans. Let us therefore set rhetoric aside and work as one to redress the enormous damage we have done to the common home of humankind.  As to the political situation in Timor Leste  in April and May 2006  less than five years after my country’s accession to full independence  we were plunged into our first major crisis. The then President of the Republic  the Speaker of the National Parliament and the Prime Minister jointly agreed to seek the United Nations urgent assistance and the rapid intervention of friendly countries. I wish to reiterate here our sincere gratitude to those who came to our assistance in that time of need. We are forever grateful to Malaysia  Australia and New Zealand  as well as to Portugal  which dispatched a fully equipped company of its elite force  the National Republican Guard. The Security Council approved the deployment of an integrated mission  the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT)  with a police component of 1 740 police. The deployment of the United Nations police contingent was understandably extremely slow  and the projected force was complete only in January 2007.  We have made significant progress since the dark weeks of April and May 2006. Presidential and legislative elections were held between April and June 2007. The election campaign period was mostly free of violence and there were few reported irregularities. Though we are proud that the two elections were managed by our own agencies  we also acknowledge that the active support of UNMIT and other United Nations agencies  including the United Nations Development Programme  were indispensable and crucial to enable us to undertake such a complex task.  While the result of the presidential election was warmly welcomed by all  including the defeated candidate  the same did not happen when a new Government was announced following the 30 June legislative election. FRETILIN  the former ruling party  won most votes  but not enough to govern on its own; after several weeks of lobbying  it failed to forge a coalition to govern. A post-election four-party parliamentary alliance opposed to FRETILIN secured 37 seats in the new Parliament of 65 seats  was invited to form a Government. There was violence in a number of locations in which local law enforcement elements were implicated  but the swift intervention of the United Nations police and the International Stabilization Force (ISF) succeeded in quickly controlling the situation. Our own defence force played a constructive role in helping to defuse the violence. I also acknowledge the role played by the FRETILIN leadership in restraining its more passionate followers.  Law and order have been restored. However  the relative tranquillity prevailing in the country is precarious and due in large measure to the effective role played by United Nations police  ISF and our own defence force. That will remain the case until such time as our police force has been reconstructed and turned into a credible and effective force. That will take two to five years at a minimum. I wish to assure all that  in the meantime  the East Timorese will pursue national dialogue so that we can reconcile and heal the wounds of the past.  As to the social situation in Timor Leste  the 2006 crisis caused widespread looting and destruction in the capital. More than 30 people died  more than 100 were wounded  and tens of thousands were displaced. We are slowly recovering. However  tens of thousands of people remain in precarious camps in the capital and elsewhere. I thank the international community  the United Nations and its agencies  the International Organization for Migration  and international non-governmental organizations for their generous and prompt assistance. The new Government has pledged to cooperate with all to address the situation of internally displaced persons.  Last year’s late rains  floods and a locust plague have caused significant damage to our subsistence agriculture sector. As a result  an acute food shortage is foreseen in the coming months. The Government is planning to purchase significant amounts of food items in the regional markets to make up for the food shortage.  Endowed with some oil and gas resources  Timor-Leste cannot complain of not having enough financial means to turn our economy around and lift the living standards of our people. According to a recent report of the Asian Development Bank  Timor-Leste’s economy will see a strong 22-per-cent growth this year due to our oil revenues.  However  all this is not enough to improve the living standards of the people. The vast majority of the people who have been poor for centuries should not wait. I have pledged to be the President of the poor and I intend to be their best advocate. I am establishing a fast-track mechanism under my personal leadership to provide direct assistance to individuals  groups or rural communities. The idea is that it should take no more than 10 working days for a decision to be made on a project and for the first instalment of a grant to be disbursed. Coupled with public investments in infrastructure   roads  bridges  port and airport   and in the agriculture sector  Timor-Leste should see  in the medium term  a significant reduction of unemployment and a decrease in poverty levels.  Regarding the presence of the United Nations  we are cognizant of the fact that the international community faces a number of critical situations around the world   in the Middle East  Somalia  the Sudan-Darfur  Iraq and Afghanistan  to mention but a few   that are far more serious than the situation in my country and that may be of greater strategic importance and have greater implications for regional and world peace. We hope that as the situation progresses  the Peacebuilding Commission will consider placing Timor-Leste on its agenda as a follow-up to UNMIT.  I now turn to the issues of human rights  the rule of law and justice. At the time that sovereignty was transferred to the people of Timor-Leste  in May 2002  what existed was no more than the sketch   the idea   of a modern  democratic State. We had to build our country from scratch. While we failed in many areas  we succeeded in others. We have succeeded in not abandoning our deep commitment to our human rights and the rule of law. Timor-Leste stands among the very few that have ratified all seven core human rights treaties.   Timor-Leste seeks a seat on the Human Rights Council for the term 2008-2011  and we are particularly pleased and grateful that many countries have so far expressed support for our candidacy. I wish to assure everyone that as a member of the Council  Timor-Leste will favour dialogue on human rights situations and will accord priority to strengthening thematic procedures  promoting the ratification of existing human rights treaties and strengthening national and regional human rights mechanisms.  Next  I shall discuss the Truth and Friendship Commission. In August 2005  the Presidents of Timor-Leste and Indonesia inaugurated a forward-looking policy and mechanism of truth-finding as a means to address the violence of 1999  when the two countries parted ways. While there were some calls for the establishment of an ad hoc international tribunal to try those responsible for the 1999 violence  the leaders of the two countries opted instead for a binational version of the South African truth and reconciliation process. That was a novel and unique approach to redressing the wrongs of the past  although  being untested  it provoked much criticism and opposition in certain quarters.  With regard to international and regional relations  we are expanding and consolidating our relations with the region and the rest of the world. We are an active member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum and are working towards full membership in ASEAN. We are an active observer in the Pacific Islands Forum and a member of the Comunidade dos países de Lingua Portuguesa (CPLD).  I shall now turn to some international issues of concern to Timor-Leste. With regard to the situation in Myanmar  I wish to say that  as a country of the region  Timor-Leste is following the developments there with deep concern and disappointment. As human beings and friends  we are distressed at the deteriorating social  humanitarian and political conditions in that neighbouring country. The leaders of Myanmar must not continue to hold Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the entire nation hostage to a mindset that belongs to the cold war and to policies that have brought international opprobrium and economic ruin to a country endowed with vast natural resources and a very proud people.  With regard to nuclear proliferation  Timor-Leste commends the six-party talks on North Korea  which have achieved some modest positive results in inducing that country to reverse its nuclear-weapons capability. That modest success shows that patient diplomacy can make progress on even the most intractable conflicts when the parties involved identify common concern and interest.  On the other hand  Timor-Leste is deeply concerned about the climate of mistrust and confrontation regarding the situation in Iran. Iran is entitled to explore all peaceful means to acquire technology that would make it less reliant on non-renewable sources of energy. No one denies that Iran or any other nation has that right. However  Iran must do more to cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency and to reassure its neighbours and the rest of the world that it is not seeking to acquire nuclear-weapons capability.  Asia is the most nuclearized region of the world. I do not know that we should be proud of such a status. Mutually assured destruction   MAD   is indeed madness  as the acronym itself suggests. Our scientists have developed Frankenstein’s monsters that may well destroy us all   either by design  if the weapons fall into the hands of non-State actors  or by accident.  Concerning the death penalty  Timor-Leste is part of a cross-regional initiative calling for a moratorium. We note that the trend towards the worldwide abolition of the death penalty continues.  As for the situation in Darfur  Timor-Leste commends the African Union  the United Nations  all those in Government and those individuals who have done their very best to end the suffering of the people in that region   suffering that is now compounded by natural calamity. In the midst of such a tragedy  we can find some consolation and inspiration as we see millions of people around the world crossing the boundaries of religions and cultures and joining together in solidarity with the victims of Darfur.  I now turn to the situation in Palestine. As a small and newly independent nation and a friend of Israel  Timor-Leste cannot remain indifferent to the suffering of the Palestinian people  who have many times been victims   victims of Israel’s obstinate policies of occupation and discrimination  victims of manipulation by regional Powers and victims of their own sectarian division and violence. While Timor-Leste does not subscribe to the many one-sided anti-Israel resolutions adopted over the years in various United Nations bodies  the facts on the ground show a whole people living on the edge of desperation as a result of decades of humiliation  exclusion and violence. Timor-Leste joins the rest of the international community in calling for the implementation of the Road Map  leading to the formal establishment of a viable Palestinian State.  With regard to Western Sahara  Timor-Leste is encouraged and commends both Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO for the recent talks held on Long Island under the good offices of the United Nations.   Concerning indigenous peoples’ rights  more than 500 years ago   long after Chinese navigators and explorers had circumnavigated the globe   European kings  navigators  missionaries  adventurers and mercenaries began the great European conquest of the world. In the process  tens of millions of people were subjugated and colonized  fortunes and empires were made at the expense of the peoples with whom they came into contact and new diseases were brought into the new colonies. Slavery uprooted at least 10 million from the African continent. Millions of indigenous peoples were decimated by wars and diseases. Their demise and their lands gave birth to new nations that were alien to their sacred birthplaces. This very island of Manhattan was once the sovereign home of Native Americans.   That is all part of the history of the world: the history of European conquest  with its glory and tragedy. Timor-Leste commends the General Assembly for finally adopting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (resolution 61/295  annex). That is the least we can do to redress the grave injustices done to some of the earlier civilizations of the world.  I now turn to the issue of United Nations reform. Negotiations on reform of the United Nations system  in particular of the Security Council  should begin. Rather than seeking dramatic reforms  we may want to adopt an incremental approach. The Council must be incrementally expanded to include major Powers such as India  Indonesia  Japan  Brazil  South Africa and Germany. On the other hand  it is an absurdity that Asia  which contains almost half of the world’s population  should be so grossly underrepresented."
"170",6878,"TON",62,2007,"At the outset  I offer my congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Let me assure him of the Kingdom of Tonga’s cooperation  and of every confidence that the sixty-second session of the General Assembly will be productive and successful under his very able leadership. I also wish to commend Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain for her dedication in guiding the work of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the new Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and to assure him of Tonga’s support during his tenure in office.  As the United Nations advances well into its sixty-second year  we can ask ourselves how we have fared in the stewardship of our world. Have we passed the test or have we been found wanting? The plethora of outstanding issues  unfulfilled commitments  and new and evolving global challenges reaffirms the relevance of the United Nations as the only multilateral institution that can appropriately deal with these complex global issues.  The year 2007 marks the halfway point towards the target date for accomplishment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  which were endorsed by world leaders as a road map to a better world by the year 2015. As the President rightly observed  “[a]chieving the MDGs is not solely a test of our ability to deliver on our promises; it is  above all  a test of our moral obligations and the values that are enshrined in the Charter” (A/62/PV.1).  The process of an annual ministerial review of progress made in the implementation of development goals and targets  which commenced this year  provides us with a tool to gauge progress at the national level and bring into focus outstanding issues to be addressed  as well as highlighting positive experiences and best practices that can be replicated by Member States. In addition  the President’s proposal to hold a MDG leaders meeting during the sixty-second session is very welcome.  Any meaningful discussion of the MDG cannot be had without also referring to financing for development. Since the landmark agreement endorsed in Monterrey in 1992  the scorecard has been mixed. While considerable advances have been made in some areas  stagnation or retrogression has been experienced in others. One such area is in the fulfilment of commitments by developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) for overseas development assistance by 2015. Tonga joins others in calling on donor countries that have not fulfilled their obligations to recommit themselves to meeting the targets by 2015. We also look forward to a positive outcome in the forthcoming High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development to be held later this month as a lead-up to the Follow-up International Conference in Doha  Qatar  in 2008.  Tonga has emphasized in other forums that  in order to achieve the MDGs  it is also imperative that affordable  clean and efficient energy be available to all through improved access to reliable and affordable energy services. Technical and financial support  however  is required to ensure that the poor derive tangible benefits from public investment in the energy sector.  The central theme selected for the general debate  responding to climate change  is of particular relevance to small island developing countries  including Tonga. Climate change is not regarded as just an environmental issue  since it has implications for economic growth  sustainable development and the achievement of the MDGs. Tonga commends the Secretary-General for his laudable initiative to hold the recent high-level dialogue  which infused political momentum and set the stage for the Bali Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in December 2007. Tonga supports the view that negotiations must be advanced towards a global and comprehensive agreement on a post-2010 framework to limit global emissions to avoid dangerous climate change. It is important  therefore  that this process be completed by 2009.  Tonga further supports the position that the essential parameters of such a global framework should include the following items: enhanced leadership by the industrialized countries on emission reductions; incentives for developing countries to act  but without sacrificing economic growth or poverty reduction  and in a manner fully consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities; significantly increased support for adaptation in developing countries  especially the least developed countries and small island developing States; and strengthened technology development and dissemination  with new approaches to financing  including better use of market-based approaches.  The threat of terrorism continues to be real  and it is a complex global issue. Following the adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) in September 2006  success will be guaranteed only if the Strategy is fully implemented. Tonga looks forward to positive progress leading to the finalization of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism during the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.  As regards peacekeeping operations  we are all witnessing a surge in the demand for peace operations  with over 100 000 personnel currently serving in the field. It is also projected that there will be a further increase in numbers as new and expanded missions are approved. This development will certainly provide a major operational challenge to the institution. Tonga remains committed to supporting international peacekeeping efforts where we are requested to provide such assistance and in keeping with the policy of my Government. We commend the contributions of United Nations peacekeepers in fulfilling the role of helping parties to end hostilities.  Tonga supports the ongoing work on the reform agenda of the United Nations and commends the commitment by the Secretary-General to breathe new life and inject renewed confidence into a strengthened United Nations firmly anchored in the twenty-first century  and effective  efficient  coherent and accountable. On the outstanding issue of Security Council reform  we need to remind ourselves of our commitment in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) to early reform of the Council. Tonga looks forward to the forthcoming intergovernmental negotiations and anticipates that the process will provide the necessary impetus for decisive action to bring closure to the issue.  On the question of Taiwan  Tonga is of the view that maintaining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States are among the cardinal principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Thus  Tonga continues to adhere to the one-China policy  recognizing Taiwan as an integral part of China.  Regional integration and cooperation are vital for small island developing countries of the Pacific in view of their remoteness  small size and narrow economic base. The Pacific Plan is currently in its second year of implementation; it focuses on four overlapping pillars  including economic growth  sustainable development  good governance and security. In this regard  Tonga commends the Secretary-General for attaching importance to strengthening United Nations cooperation with our regional organizations. Tonga continues to support the process of regional cooperation and looks forward to hosting the thirty-eighth annual Pacific Islands Leaders Forum in Nuku’alofa later this month.  After 10 years of negotiations  the World Trade Organization (WTO) welcomed Tonga on 27 July 2007 as the 151st member of the organization. As a small island developing nation  there are many challenges and obstacles to gaining full benefit from the global trading system  including productive capacity and infrastructure. It is  therefore  imperative that the Doha development Round negotiations be concluded expeditiously  with a meaningful development package  including the elimination of all export subsidies  improved market access and enhanced special and differentiated treatment. Last year  we urged the donor community to move forward with the delivery of “aid for trade” independent of the Doha Round. In this regard  we wish to commend our donor partners for the effort to improve the delivery of aid for trade in Asia and the Pacific to ensure that countries take full advantage of the open global market in the lead-up to the WTO global aid for trade review that will be held later this year.  Tonga continues to advocate for labour mobility as a vehicle for achieving its pro-poor strategies. Earlier this year  the New Zealand Government instituted a seasonal labour programme for agricultural workers from five kick-start countries in the Pacific  including Tonga. We view this as an important and positive step towards wider acceptance of this type of model by developed countries as an option for resolving seasonal labour shortages.  Our Legislative Assembly this year passed a law that allows dual citizenship. The new law gives due recognition to the large number of Tongans residing overseas  their significant contribution to the economy and their desire to still have links to their homeland.  Last year at this rostrum  we provided a brief synopsis of the state of play in the process leading to the greater democratization of Tonga’s political system. Regrettably  while the report of the National Committee on Political Reform was being deliberated by the Legislative Assembly  the supporters of one of the three models of reform rioted  burned and destroyed 80 per cent of the central business district  which resulted in the loss of eight lives. In a matter of a few hours  the tally of the damage incurred equated to a loss of 20 per cent of the gross domestic product. A state of emergency was subsequently declared by the Government  initially for a one-month period  but has by necessity and by demand been continuously extended to prevent any further civil disturbance. In our hour of need  Tonga sought the support of its neighbours New Zealand and Australia to assist local police in establishing order. They responded promptly and appropriately with the deployment of military and police personnel. Within a period of two weeks  the role played by our friendly neighbours  as well as by the Tonga Defence Services and the Tonga Police Force  provided security and law and order for the country.  A reconstruction committee under my chairmanship is coordinating the reconstruction of Nuku’alofa Township. Government  however  is fully committed to bringing all of the perpetrators of that horrendous event to full accountability for their actions  and the court cases are ongoing. At the same time  efforts are in progress on a process of national reconciliation.  A tripartite select committee of the Legislative Assembly was also established to review the political reform agenda. The report of the tripartite committee was recently tabled to the Legislative Assembly  where a timetable was approved for the full implementation of political reform by 2010.  We seek the understanding and support of the international community as we continue with the healing of the wounds through the national reconciliation process  the rebuilding of the central business district  as well as the transition into a more democratic political system that is relevant to the economic  social and cultural architecture of the nation.  It has been emphasized time and again that what is needed in the United Nations is to close the gap between rhetoric and actions. There has been much rhetoric and commitment  but the world will not judge us on rhetoric. The world will judge us on our outputs and on what we deliver. Let us face up to our responsibility  fulfil our promises so as to equate rhetoric with action  and show the people whose lives will be impacted by the decisions we make in this Hall that we can be trusted to deal effectively with global issues that require global solutions. "
"171",6918,"TTO",62,2007,"I wish to take  this opportunity to congratulate you most sincerely on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. My delegation is confident that your in-depth knowledge of international economic and political issues  complemented by your extensive diplomatic experience  will serve you in good stead to guide our deliberations effectively in the coming months.  I also wish to take this opportunity to express Trinidad and Tobago’s deep appreciation for the leadership of your predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  the first Arab woman to hold that lofty position. As President of the General Assembly  her efforts contributed to focusing the attention of the international community on the pressing challenges of climate change  inter alia  thereby facilitating  in the process  global awareness and increased support for internationally agreed action on this issue given its impact on our planet and  especially  on the very survival of several small island developing States.  I consider this occasion opportune  as well  to convey Trinidad and Tobago's unequivocal support for our current Secretary-General His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. We commend his leadership role in the troubling humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of the Sudan and applaud his initiative to convene the High-Level Event on Climate Change. These are indeed apt demonstrations of his willingness to confront forcefully and resolutely issues of transcendental importance to the present and future well-being of peoples everywhere.  Though small in size and population  Trinidad and Tobago  through visionary leadership  transparency and public accountability and prudent management of our natural resources  is continuing along a path of sustainable development. Our development strategy seeks to go beyond the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to ensure that by the year 2020 all sectors of our multi-ethnic and multicultural society will enjoy a standard of living comparable to that of the developed world.  The performance of our economy draws its strength from vertically integrated and well-developed energy and petrochemical industries  which are complemented by buoyant and competitive manufacturing and service sectors  including financial services and tourism  as well as by the ongoing transformation of the agricultural sector. All these factors provide the basis for economic growth levels off 8.6 per cent over the last five years and a recorded rate of 12 per cent in 2006. We have also been able to achieve a 7 per cent reduction in poverty from a high of 24 per cent in 1998 and are currently experiencing a low unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent.   It is on the basis of this strong economic performance that Trinidad and Tobago has continued its commitment to the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  as we seek to advance the integration process  moving from the current stage of the single market to that of a single economy. Effective participation in this process of furthering strengthening and deepening the regional integration movement remains a major foreign policy goal of the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is for this reason and given the fact that our economic fortunes are inextricably linked  that Trinidad and Tobago continues to provide economic and humanitarian assistance to several CARICOM countries adversely affected by natural disasters.  Our further economic development and that of the global community as a whole  is dependent on the existence of global peace and security. In this regard  the Security Council has continued to take timely decisions on global crises in different parts of the globe  on terrorism and on nuclear non-proliferation.   The reform of that principal organ of the United Nations  charged with maintaining international peace and security  continues  however  to elude us. It is time to engage in bona fide negotiations on this matter. The status quo is unacceptable. The Security Council must be reformed to reflect the current geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century and no longer the world as it was in the aftermath of World War II. New and important actors from Africa  Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean are a part of today’s global reality. An expanded and enhanced Security Council would provide the Council with even greater legitimacy and support in the carrying out of its Charter responsibilities. Trinidad and Tobago is of the view that much progress was made during the sixty-first session and the political momentum which was generated there should not be lost.   A reinvigorated Security Council is needed to address the major issues that continue to bedevil contemporary international relations. In the Middle East  the failure to move forward on the peace process has set back global efforts to achieve a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The Palestinian people have yet to exercise their legitimate rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State in an undivided homeland.   We call on the Quartet to resume the Road Map process for peace in the Middle East  so that the world can  in the foreseeable future  see two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace  within internationally recognized and secure borders. Additionally  internationally acceptable solutions must be found to address the fate of the Palestinian refugees  the status of Jerusalem and the issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. All these matters have remained pending for far too long and the Palestinians should no longer be denied the realization of their statehood.  While there has been little or no progress in the matter of peace in the Middle East  the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago is pleased to note that  with respect to the humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of the Sudan  agreement has finally been reached  which has resulted in the deployment of a hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force for Darfur. We welcome this positive development. While we hope that the hybrid United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force will bring peace and stability to the region and enable humanitarian relief to flow once again to where it is most urgently required  all our efforts must now be turned towards putting a cease-fire in place and striving to have all the rebels groups fighting in Darfur move towards a peace arrangement with the Sudanese Government. Peace and justice are  however  inextricably linked and there can be no lasting peace in Darfur without accountability for the heinous crimes committed against the people of Darfur during the conflict.  While international political and security developments continue to pose major difficulties for the international community  developments in the area of international trade give rise to even greater concern. We are mindful of the reality that the steadfast efforts of Trinidad and Tobago  of the subregion and of other developing countries to confront effectively the challenges of globalization and liberalization would be rendered futile in the absence of a fair  transparent and equitable international economic trading system. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago therefore remains deeply concerned that  after many years of protracted negotiations characterized by many missed deadlines  the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations has yet to reach a compromise that would pave the way for an agreed outcome  particularly in the areas of agriculture and industrial products  and that incorporates the development dimension. We underscore the importance of ensuring that the principle of special and differential treatment is truly reflected throughout the negotiating modalities  and we call upon all parties in the negotiations to take fully into account the special needs of small and vulnerable economies.  The Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago fully expects that the negotiations will resume in good faith and that there will be commensurate progress in agriculture  industrial products and all other areas of the negotiations  in keeping with the mandate of a single undertaking. That will ensure the successful conclusion of the Round and an outcome that fully reflects the commitment undertaken at Doha to put development at the heart of the multilateral trading system.  While those trade negotiations seem to have stalled and will require the injection of a high degree of political will to bring them to a successful conclusion  the international community is faced with yet another global concern in the form of climate change. As a result of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use and land-use changes through deforestation  the world is already destined to an increase of 1.14 degrees Celsius by the end of the next two decades.  There therefore needs to be a clearly defined global mitigation strategy that keeps the long-term temperature increase at less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Increases over 2 degrees Celsius are very likely to have an increased adverse impact on small island developing States  such as Trinidad and Tobago. In order to avoid a global climate disaster  the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago calls for urgent and ambitious action by all States in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities  respective capabilities and social and economic conditions.  As a State party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol  we call on all States parties to UNFCCC  particularly major emitters of greenhouse gases  to agree at Bali to launch negotiations on a post-2012 regime. In those negotiations  the Government of Trinidad and Tobago and other like-minded Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member States will seek to achieve substantial and legally binding emission reductions in the shortest timeframe possible and significant increases in the level of resources available to developing countries  in particular small island developing States  to assist them in adapting to the adverse effects of climate change. To this end  the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago has already made a voluntary contribution of $1 million to the trust fund for the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre in Belize to strengthen that institution  so that it can assist CARICOM member States in implementing their adaptation strategies to deal with the adverse effects of climate change.  But we in the Caribbean are not only concerned about global warming and its adverse effects on Caribbean States. We are also deeply interested in preserving the marine environment of the Caribbean Sea  which is an important natural resource for all its littoral island and continental States  given their varying degrees of dependence on tourism. The passage through the Caribbean Sea of ships carrying radioactive waste is an issue to which all CARICOM Governments attach the highest importance. Allow me to take this opportunity to reiterate the continued objection of Caribbean countries against the use of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of radioactive waste. The repeated scientific and safety reports may offer some reassurance  but they do very little to appease our concern.  Our Prime Minister  Mr. Patrick Manning  in his 2008 budget statement  brought into sharp focus the vision of the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago for our cosmopolitan society. He emphasized that the mission in which we as a nation are engaged collectively is a transformation process aimed at bringing sustained prosperity and the requisite higher quality of life to every individual  family and community across the country. The Government has therefore sought to give concrete expression to the national quest for a highly competitive  productive  innovative and caring society  in which all are encouraged to attain their highest potential and are facilitated in doing so.  It is  accordingly  in this spirit that we have just signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  which was adopted and opened for signature during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly  and we will take steps to ratify the Convention once the necessary implementing legislation is put in place to complement what is already provided for in our domestic policy with regard to persons with disabilities.  It is this confidence in and respect for the international rule of law that has encouraged Trinidad and Tobago to campaign  since the late 1980s and at the highest political levels  for the establishment of an International Criminal Court (ICC). We are keenly aware of the important strides being made by ICC  as it devotes its attention to the prosecution of individuals accused of committing the crimes within its jurisdiction  namely  genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Trinidad and Tobago recalls in this connection the adoption at the Rome Diplomatic Conference of a resolution recommending that a conference to review the Court’s Statute also consider the inclusion of trafficking in illegal drugs on an international scale as being within the Court’s jurisdiction. We must seize the opportunity now forced upon us by international trends to fully engage ICC in efforts to stem the tide of that scourge  and similarly  to consider the inclusion of acts of terrorism  once that term is clearly defined by the international community.  Our approach will be grounded in the recognition of the continued deleterious effects that the international trade in illegal drugs is having on the social fabric of societies the world over  including in the Caribbean. The time has come for the international community to recognize the illicit trafficking of drugs as an international crime subject to the jurisdiction of ICC.  Another area of public international law to which Trinidad and Tobago attaches the utmost importance is the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This year’s meeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea addressed the important issue of marine genetic resources. Part XI of the Convention explicitly provides that the area beyond national jurisdiction and its resources are the common heritage of mankind. Trinidad and Tobago is accordingly of the view that any legal regime developed to regulate the marine genetic resources of the Area must be guided by the common heritage principle. Adherence to such a principle would ensure that the resources of the Area are exploited for the benefit of all members of the international community  and not just for the benefit of those with the financial wherewithal and the technical know-how.  Similarly  we recognize that all States parties to the Convention are ipso facto members of the International Seabed Authority. Despite the importance of the current work of the Authority on polymetallic sulphides and cobalt crusts  many States parties fail to attend the annual sessions of the Authority held in Jamaica. The continued absence of States undermines the common heritage principle laid down in Part XI of the Convention and threatens the very legitimacy of the work of the Authority. We accordingly call on all members of the Authority to attend regularly the sessions of the Authority and thus assist it in adopting regulations governing the exploration and exploitation of the mineral resources in the Area  which are of benefit to all mankind.  Trinidad and Tobago  like its Caribbean neighbours  acknowledges its maternal links to Africa and notes that 2007 was an important year for the peoples of that continent and for the African diaspora worldwide. Earlier this year  we observed here at Headquarters and in the capitals of all CARICOM States a programme of activities intended to raise the consciousness of peoples the world over regarding the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade and the deleterious effects it had on Africa  depriving that continent of millions of its inhabitants  and on people of African descent in the Americas. We in Trinidad and Tobago have used the opportunity to educate all of our citizens on the degrading treatment to which those human beings were subjected and to demonstrate that  notwithstanding our history of slavery  followed by the indentureship of other segments of our population  the people of Trinidad and Tobago have developed a harmonious cosmopolitan society  which is an accomplishment worthy of emulation in other parts of the globe that are fractured by fratricidal ethnic and religious struggles.  In order for the suffering of millions of enslaved Africans not to have been in vain  the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago intends to make a financial contribution to the CARICOM initiative for a permanent memorial to be erected within these hallowed walls of the United Nations in remembrance of all those who perished in the Middle Passage and on the plantations in the New World in their struggle for freedom and liberation from the yoke of slavery. We call upon the international community to contribute generously to such a worthwhile and historic venture.  In conclusion  the United Nations remains a centre for harmonizing the goals and aspirations of all mankind. There is no other universal forum with greater legitimacy or a more suitable mandate to bring about an improvement in the human condition. We must address all these global issues with firmness of purpose and in a resolute manner if we are to save coming generations from the adverse consequences of war  underdevelopment and poverty  as well as the deleterious effects of climate change  and to ensure that all humanity can enjoy improved standards of living in freedom and in dignity on a habitable planet.

"172",6965,"TUN",62,2007,"At the  outset  I would like to express to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim and to his friendly country our most sincere congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We are confident that under his skilful and effective leadership  our deliberations will be successful.   I wish also to extend to our sister  Her Excellency Ms. Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  our deep thanks and appreciation for her valuable efforts as President of the Assembly at its previous session towards the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and towards enhancing dialogue among all members of the international community and reviving the Security Council reform process.   I wish also to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his endeavours and his determination to reform the functioning of the Organization. We wish him every success.   Signs of new dynamism in the United Nations reform process reflect a true desire to improve the Organization’s work so as to bring it in line with the requirements of the new world realities and with new concepts arising from the profound and speedy transformations the world has experienced in recent decades.   In our view  giving effect to that desire requires new working frameworks and mechanisms to reinforce the underpinnings of international peace and security and enable us to achieve collective solutions to the common challenges facing the international community. We should be inspired in that endeavour by a new vision that lays the foundation for a comprehensive  effective and solidarity-based global partnership among the members of the international community  on the basis of constructive dialogue among peoples  cultures  civilizations and religions.   On the basis of that conviction  Tunisia has launched international initiatives with political  humanitarian and social dimensions. Some of these initiatives were adopted by the United Nations  such as the establishment of the World Solidarity Fund. We look forward to increased efforts by the international community to operationalize the Fund.   Since the early 1990s  Tunisia has been in the forefront of countries drawing attention to the dangers of terrorism and its negative impact on world security and stability. Today  Tunisia renews its call for an international conference  under United Nations auspices  in order to formulate an international code of conduct for combating terrorism  by which all parties would abide.   Convinced of the significant role that dialogue among civilizations plays in obviating the dangers of extremism and intolerance  Tunisia has consistently endeavoured to be the world capital of dialogue among civilizations  by hosting several regional and international conferences and seminars. It has also taken initiatives in this field  such as the publication of the Carthage Charter for Tolerance in 1995  the appeal by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali for a pedagogy of tolerance  the 2001 Tunis Declaration on Dialogue among Civilizations  and the establishment  in the University of Tunis  of the Ben Ali Chair for Dialogue among Civilizations and Religions.   We take note with satisfaction of the focus on the theme of climate change during the current session’s general debate  in view of the fact that environmental issues are a basic pillar of sustainable development and one of the major elements of the Millennium Development Goals   one that has an impact on international peace and security.   Tunisia believes that climate change poses a common threat to all States of the world without exception. This has prompted Tunisia to host  next November  an international ministerial workshop to discuss climate change in Africa and the Mediterranean region  as a contribution to increasing and deepening awareness of the importance of this issue and to enriching regional dialogue on it.   The international community and all its members must devote more attention to the environment and to finding urgent and effective collective solutions to environmental issues in certain regions of the world   notably in Africa  which suffers most from the climate change that is threatening the continent’s aspirations to development and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.   The fact that several important international political problems remain unsolved continues to be a source of concern for us. Today  Tunisia reaffirms that it upholds the values of peace and justice and the principles of international legitimacy  and that it is prepared to contribute to the dissemination and promotion of the values of tolerance  moderation and mutual respect among nations and peoples. In our view  that should help consolidate a constructive dialogue among civilizations and establish international cooperation and a solidarity-based development partnership that will help eliminate the causes of tension and conflict worldwide.   On this occasion  we reaffirm our principled and constant support for the Palestinian people in their struggle for their just cause. We urge the international community  in particular the influential parties and the Quartet  to intensify their efforts aimed at reviving the peace process  on the basis of United Nations resolutions and the relevant Arab and international terms of reference  inter alia  the Arab Peace Initiative  with a view to finding a just and comprehensive solution that would guarantee the restoration of the Palestinians’ legitimate rights  foremost among which is the establishment of their own independent State.   We welcome the initiative taken by President Bush and certain international influential parties to revive the peace process. In this context  we wish to stress the importance of convening an international peace conference that should yield concrete proposals for achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and lead to the restitution of all occupied Arab territories and guarantee security and stability to all the countries and peoples of the region.   By the same token  we call for concerted regional and international efforts to help the brotherly Iraqi people to restore the deteriorating security  economic and humanitarian situation in their country  through the achievement of a consensual political settlement among all its segments and factions that preserves the unity and sovereignty of Iraq. As far as the situation in Lebanon is concerned  we urge all Lebanese parties to favour dialogue as the sole way to prevent the scourge of dissension among the Lebanese people and to restore confidence and reconciliation among them.   Since 7 November 1987  Tunisia  under the leadership of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali  has succeeded in making pioneer achievements and gains in different fields. This has been made possible thanks to comprehensive reforms that allowed Tunisia to consolidate the rule of law and institutions  as well as public freedoms  and to disseminate  in theory and practice  the culture of human rights  thus enhancing the democratic structure of the country and paving the way for contributions by all components of civil society to define national orientations and choices for the future.   The reform process implemented in Tunisia has allowed the achievement of numerous Millennium Development Goals  which has translated into better living standards for Tunisians and well-being for all segments of Tunisian society. This reflects the correctness of development choices made by Tunisia  which has also allowed it to hold an advanced position among countries with the highest level of human development.   On many occasions  Tunisia has stated its conviction of the need for building international cooperation and partnerships based on a comprehensive approach aimed at achieving development for all and laying the foundations for constructive relations among countries of the North and the South. In this context  President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali called from this rostrum in 1989 for the adoption of a charter of peace and progress between the countries of the North and the South.   The international community is called upon to exert more efforts to enable all the peoples of the world  particularly the least developed countries  to benefit from the digital revolution and to acquire knowledge. This will require operationalizing and implementing the recommendations and resolutions made by international conferences in our country in November 2005 to contribute to the building of a global  more equitable and solidarity-based information society.   The integration of Tunisia in its regional and international environment is one of the priorities of its foreign policy  which endeavours to enhance political relations with brotherly and friendly nations as well with regional and international organizations. Tunisia looks forward to the broadening and diversification of the scope of its cooperation with all its partners in order to bring it to the level of an efficient partnership based on mutual respect and common interest. Hence  Tunisia is constantly striving  with its brotherly Maghrebian countries  to complete the formation of the Maghreb Arab Union and to consolidate its structures and institutions in order to reinforce integration and complementarity among the peoples of the region.  Tunisia has equally sought to enhance the effectiveness of Arab common action. It seeks to upgrade its interaction with the changes and challenges confronting the region and to further the process of reform and modernization in this field  in conformity with the decisions and recommendations of the Tunis Summit  the Algiers Summit and the Riyadh Summit.   On the other hand  Tunisia  being a member of Arab committees entrusted with Palestinian  Lebanese and other issues  is participating effectively in the work of those committees for the benefit of Arab causes.   As far as Africa is concerned  Tunisia has enhanced its relations with African countries and has strengthened cooperation with them. It has made active efforts to contribute effectively to the process of building the structures and institutions of the African Union and to the consolidation of the fundamentals of peace  security and stability in the continent and opening promising new horizons for development in order to further enhance integration among its peoples.   In view of the strategic importance of its relations with the European Union  Tunisia has been constantly seeking to advance those ties and to broaden their scope  so as to cover all fields of cooperation with the aim of building a solidarity-based partnership with European Union countries based on mutual respect and common interest.   Tunisia also endeavours to strengthen the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation process. In this connection  Tunisia has welcomed the initiative launched by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France for establishing a Mediterranean Union. Tunisia has further expressed its readiness to contribute to and participate in shaping the content of such a union and in defining its objectives.   Since the establishment of the United Nations  Tunisia has expressed constant faith in the noble principles and purposes of the Organization. It has always been committed to lending its support to efforts aimed at creating favourable conditions for appropriate collective responses to global common challenges and for solving the various problems that are a source of concern to the world  as well as establishing solidarity-based cooperation and partnership among all components of the international community.   From this perspective  Tunisia  which will assume chairmanship of the next session of the Conference on Disarmament  is determined to work  in coordination with Member States  for the achievement of tangible progress regarding issues on the agenda of the Conference. In so doing  Tunisia will seek to enhance constructive and positive dialogue on those issues in order to achieve the objectives of the Conference and to contribute to the consolidation of peace and security in the world and to the dissemination of a global culture of peace  thus consecrating the noble values and principles for which our Organization has been created.  "
"173",7012,"TUR",62,2007,"It gives me  great pleasure once again to address this body where we unite our goals and labours for a better and brighter future. I wish to wholeheartedly congratulate you  Sir   our good friend the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Macedonia  Mr. Srgjan Kerim   on your election to preside over this global forum.  I would also like on this occasion to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and to wish him success in his current position.  Our world today needs  more than ever before  effective cooperation to find common solutions to our global problems  to replace desperation with hope  poverty with prosperity  injustice with justice and violence with peace around the world. The United Nations  created precisely for that mission  is the only international forum that can possibly  with our collective resolve  lead us to those objectives. The United Nations is also the source of international legitimacy for our actions to those ends. But  it is incumbent on us  the Member States  to make the Organization stronger and more effective and to furnish it with the means and structures it needs to tackle competently the many challenges of our century.  Here  I believe we need to be more resolute and bold in our actions while adopting more forthcoming and creative approaches. Although significant structural reforms have been realized  the process is far from completed. The reform process must continue  and structural and functional adjustments should be made to respond to needs that may arise.  We must bear in mind that reforming the Security Council in a way that would command the widest possible consensus would also reflect positively on the legitimacy  credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations itself.  I wish on this occasion also to confirm Turkey’s candidature for a seat on the Security Council at the elections to be held next year. My country  which is committed to the ideals enshrined in the Charter and which constructively contributes to the maintenance of global peace at a strategic crossroads where different continents and cultures meet  has not been represented on the Council for almost half a century. I genuinely believe that with the valuable support of its fellow Member States  Turkey  with its European and Asian identity  can assume a distinctive and constructive role in harmonizing and reconciling differing views within the Security Council  just as it does in its efforts to facilitate harmony among cultures.  We have reached an important stage in the implementation phase of the Alliance of Civilizations initiative under the auspices of the Secretary-General; we are co-sponsoring this initiative together with Spain. We are determined to make our vision of global harmony become a reality through the implementation of concrete projects under the strong leadership of the High Representative  the former President of Portugal  Mr. Jorge Sampaio  and with the support that I am confident the international community will not deny this initiative. The meeting held at the United Nations with the Alliance Group of Friends earlier this week served to renew our hope and confidence in the promising future of the initiative. The vast majority of international problems of high priority on the agenda of the United Nations are taking place in our immediate surroundings  the scene of major tension and transformation. We are exerting every effort to constructively contribute to the resolution of all these disputes   which directly impact Turkey  although we are not party to any of them. In doing so  we seek to utilize the many possibilities offered by our strategic position  our accumulated knowledge of and insight into the region  our cultural and historical ties and our vast experience in peacekeeping.  Our highest priority is to restore stability in our region. In that connection  Turkey will resolutely pursue its efforts to serve as an important factor for peace and stability and to promote multidimensional relations with all its neighbours. The encouraging level we have achieved in our relations with Greece today as a result of the process of rapprochement that we have been pursuing for nearly 10 years is the tangible outcome of that resolve.  Likewise  ensuring a dignified place within the international community for a territorially intact  nationally unified and democratic Iraq at peace with itself and with its neighbours is at the top of our priorities for restoring stability in our region.  In line with our desire to realize this common vision  we continue to diversify our cooperation with the Iraqi Government and support the process of political dialogue and national reconciliation in this country. The group of neighbouring countries of Iraq  created upon Turkey’s initiative and later expanded at the meeting held in Sharm el-Sheikh to include the permanent five members of the Security Council and the Group of Eight  is similarly intended to serve such a purpose. The next ministerial meeting of the expanded group of neighbouring countries will be hosted by Turkey at the beginning of November this year.  Another major source of instability in our region is the Middle East problem. We regard the question of Palestine  with wide repercussions both in and beyond the region  as the crux of all ills in the Middle East. The political rift within Palestine has further complicated the situation. Therefore  a lasting political solution to the question of Palestine and peace with Israel on the basis of a two-State solution will have important implications for regional as well as global stability. We believe that a negotiated settlement to this long-standing dispute will also reflect positively on the resolution of other problems in the region. We stand ready to support in every way possible the parties in the efforts to revive the peace process and to contribute to the prospective international meetings to be convened for this purpose.  We hope to see the ongoing political crisis in Lebanon promptly overcome through dialogue among the different factions. We will continue our intense efforts  including our contributions to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  to assist in restoring stability in that country.  We will also continue to invest in the democratic  free and prosperous future of the friendly people of Afghanistan. Our commitment to the security of the country by assuming the command of the International Security Assistance Force twice since its inception and currently of the Regional Command in Kabul  together with our contributions to the reconstruction effort through significant infrastructure projects  are the concrete expression of the challenging mission we have undertaken in Afghanistan. The activities of the Turkish Provincial Reconstruction Team in the province of Wardak  carrying out its functions under dangerous security conditions  are also part of this effort.  Moreover  the process of tripartite summits that we have initiated  with the participation of Afghanistan and Pakistan  in the desire to enhance peace and stability in the region is helping to restore confidence between these two neighbouring countries.  On the other hand  frozen conflicts pending a resolution continue to jeopardize regional peace and stability in the South Caucasus. Solutions to be found through peaceful means to existing frozen conflicts should be based on the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Azerbaijan and Georgia.  In order to realize our vision of peace  stability and economic prosperity for the region  we not only seek to contribute to the resolution of these frozen conflicts  but at the same time continue to invest in the infrastructure of regional cooperation through significant energy and transportation projects  such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum oil and natural gas pipelines and the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad. At this juncture where uncertainty regarding the final status of Kosovo persists  we continue to maintain our view that we must mobilize all efforts to find a just and sustainable solution to this question. Turkey has currently assumed the command of the Kosovo Force Multinational Task Force South in the region.  Turkey performs noble duties from the perspective of peacekeeping in almost all the regions cited above. Through its participation in various peacekeeping operations conducted under the banner of the United Nations  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  Turkey has proven its capacity to significantly contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. In this connection Turkey is also favourably considering participation in the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur  established in accordance with Security Council resolution 1769 (2007)  whose adoption we highly welcomed.  To the extent that we can stop and prevent the recurrence of conflicts that exhaust our energy and resources  we will be better able to focus on global problems that will define the common fate of humankind. At the top of these problems is the issue of climate change  which you  Mr. President  have in a very timely manner designated as the main theme of the General Assembly this year.  We discussed this issue requiring urgent collective action in all its aspects during the high-level meeting that I also had the opportunity to attend earlier this week. The most conclusive outcome of this meeting was that we must all assume our fair share of responsibility in effective international cooperation to find solutions to global warming and climate change  which pose  as never before  a grave threat to humankind’s survival.  Another grim reality in this context is that the developing world  bearing the least responsibility for climate change  will be the most adversely affected by its consequences. It is therefore incumbent on us all to assist  to the best of our ability  the developing countries in overcoming the many overwhelming challenges that they confront.  To this end  Turkey is rapidly becoming a donor country with the significant development  technical and humanitarian assistance it has been providing in recent years. The development aid provided by Turkey through official and private sources reached 1.7 billion dollars last year. We intend to continue our contributions to the relevant United Nations funds  as well as assistance at the bilateral level.  The Ministerial Conference of the Least Developed Countries hosted by Turkey in Istanbul in July this summer is another concrete expression of our resolve to assist the developing countries and enable them to take full advantage of the benefits of globalization. We are already taking steps to follow up on the outcome of this conference.  Our commitment to peace and development in Africa also finds expression in our development assistance to the continent coordinated through the branch offices of the Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency  which have been established since 2005 in Ethiopia  Sudan and Senegal. The Turkey-Africa Cooperation Summit  which we will host in 2008  and our participation in seven different United Nations and European Union peacekeeping missions in Africa are other concrete examples to this effect.  Turkey also seeks to diversify and expand its network of political and commercial cooperation with the countries of South Asia  the Far East and the Pacific region  as well as Latin American countries and the Caribbean.  Terrorism continues to threaten the security of all free nations. An act of terror committed in any part of the world in essence targets us all  as it constitutes a heinous crime against humanity. We condemn in the strongest terms this scourge that recognizes no national boundaries. As the Prime Minister of a nation that has experienced first-hand the bitter consequences of terrorism  I renew from this rostrum my appeal to the international community for an enhanced collective commitment and cooperation in the combat against this threat to humanity.  Considering the sophisticated new technologies terrorist elements are utilizing today  effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction takes on a whole new meaning and urgency. Turkey strongly supports the United Nations and the United Nations-led efforts to intensify international cooperation aimed at preventing their proliferation.  Finally  Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus have been supporting the efforts to find a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem under the good-offices mission of the United Nations Secretary-General on the basis of well established United Nations parameters. The United Nations remains the sole forum for a solution.  It should be recalled that the comprehensive settlement plan of the former United Nations Secretary-General emerged in 2004 as a result of extensive negotiations between the parties and was submitted to a simultaneous referendum on both sides of the island. The Turkish side overwhelmingly voted in favour of the Secretary-General's plan  whose impartiality cannot in any way be called into question. The Greek Cypriots  however  were misled by their leadership to reject the plan.  Despite the constructive attitude displayed by the Turkish side since then  no progress has been achieved towards a settlement owing to the intransigence of the Greek Cypriot side. It is our hope that the Annan report  which has not been endorsed yet by the Security Council  will be endorsed soon. "
"174",7028,"TUV",62,2007,"Today has a very special meaning for us: twenty-nine years ago  under the blessings of this body  Tuvalu was granted its independence. I am honoured  therefore  to speak on behalf of the people and Government of Tuvalu and to convey to this session of the United Nations General Assembly our warmest greetings.   At the outset  Tuvalu wishes to associate itself with previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Kerim in his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We also wish to take this opportunity to welcome and congratulate the Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon  on his appointment as head of the United Nations.  As we celebrate our twenty-ninth anniversary of independence  let me convey our most sincere thanks and gratitude to the international community  especially to our traditional development partners  close friends and international and regional organizations for their support and cooperation over the past years. We are confident that such gestures of understanding  friendship and cooperation will continue in the years ahead. Our endeavours to achieve excellence have been guided by the United Nations principles of good governance  respect for the rule of law and for human rights  democracy and self-determination. Our future survival as a nation is founded on these basic ideals of the United Nations.   Tuvalu welcomes the key priority issues of climate change  financing for development  achieving the Millennium Development Goals  countering terrorism  and the United Nations reform agenda  which the President has clearly identified and highlighted in his opening address at the sixty-second session. We would like  however  to focus on five main issues: the United Nations reforms  the United Nations presence in Pacific small island developing States  the question of Taiwan’s membership in the United Nations and its agencies  criteria for least developed countries graduation  and responding to climate change.  On the United Nations reforms  we acknowledge with sincerity the tremendous efforts that the Organization has made in fulfilling its purpose  based on its noble pillars of development: peace and security and human rights  as enshrined under its Charter. Through such efforts  the United Nations has reached out to many countries of the world in providing the required services for those who need them most. However  these efforts always encounter many challenges that can be resolved only if the United Nations membership and all its subsidiary bodies commit to work together in harmony and with respect for each other.  The need for the United Nations to ensure efficiency  effectiveness and transparency in carrying out its mandates and all its related programmes cannot be overemphasized. In this connection  Tuvalu welcomes and supports the ongoing work on United Nations reform. In particular  Tuvalu supports the Secretary-General’s report in response to the recommendations of the High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence and agrees that the United Nations system must be more results-oriented  efficient and accountable.  Tuvalu fully supports the ongoing reform work of the United Nations that promotes country-driven programmes. However  we are very disappointed with the unjustifiably slow progress in establishing the United Nations presence in the remaining Pacific small island developing States that do not have United Nations offices. As a full Member of the United Nations  we feel that Tuvalu and other small island developing States from the Pacific each deserve to have a United Nations office established in-country  which will be instrumental in the coordination and implementation of United Nations projects and programmes on the ground. Our isolation and geographical fragmentation in itself is justification for establishing a joint United Nations office in Tuvalu. We appeal to the United Nations for the earliest implementation of this long overdue commitment.   Tuvalu highly commends the momentum of the work on the reform of the Security Council  especially the excellent work done by the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council. Tuvalu warmly welcomes the next step of submitting the issue for further intergovernmental negotiations as a way forward. Tuvalu further supports the draft resolution tabled by India for the same purpose in addressing this very important task.  However  we are very disturbed with the continuance of finger-pointing and undiplomatic language being directed at small island developing States for their contributions to the Security Council reform process. As a small peace-loving nation and a full Member of the United Nations  Tuvalu has the sovereign right to support any issue that will benefit the achievement of the United Nations goals. We strongly believe that open dialogue and working together in mutual understanding under the framework of the United Nations is the only way to reach our shared destiny in diversity and to respect one another.   Tuvalu firmly believes that the paramount mission of the United Nations must remain the maintenance of peace and security while ensuring the universal participation of all nations of the world  as clearly articulated in the Preamble to the United Nations Charter.  However  the United Nations cannot be said to be universal nor can global peace and security be assured until the issue of Taiwan’s membership and participation in the United Nations is properly resolved. It is disappointing to note that this body does not even want to at least put Taiwan’s membership application on its agenda for proper consideration.  Let me reaffirm Tuvalu’s strong support for Taiwan’s membership application to the United Nations. We feel that this issue is long overdue and needs to be considered more seriously and purely on its own merits.   Taiwan has shown international responsibility and has helped many countries in the world   including my own country  Tuvalu   with development assistance. It is our strong opinion that Taiwan is a country with a clearly defined territory and an established democratic system of government and is a responsible international player in world trade  development and diplomatic relations. The rights and self-determination of the Taiwanese people to join the United Nations should be urgently addressed. Taiwan has all of the capabilities needed to fulfil its obligations as a peace-loving State and become a full Member of the United Nations as required under the Charter of the United Nations.   Despite all this  it is sad to note that the United Nations has continued to turn a blind eye to the wishes and needs of the people of Taiwan  who simply want to be part of the international family and participate actively in the attainment of the noble pillars of development  security and human rights. More sadly  the action taken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in not complying with the requirements of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of procedure of the Security Council is disappointing. Tuvalu further appeals for the proper and urgent consideration of Taiwan’s membership application to the United Nations.   The issue of graduating from the least developed countries (LDC) category has caused great anxiety for Tuvalu. As recognized in the Mauritius strategy for small island developing States  it is most alarming that all the potential candidates for graduation from the LDC list are Pacific small island developing States  despite our special disadvantages and environmental vulnerabilities. We appeal to this Assembly  the Economic and Social Council and our development partners to carefully reconsider the criteria for LDC graduation and their application  taking into account the special disadvantages of small island developing States.  The President’s leadership in choosing “Responding to Climate Change” as the theme of this session is highly commendable. Likewise  Tuvalu applauds the leadership of the Secretary-General on climate change. We are pleased that world leaders at the High-level Event on Climate Change have agreed on the urgency of addressing climate change in a comprehensive way. We believe we are now ready to make a historic agreement in Bali to start negotiations on a new climate change agreement.   As the Prime Minister of Tuvalu  Mr. Apisai Ielemia  clearly stated in the June issue of the United Nations Chronicle magazine  “If there is one issue that strikes at the heart of my nation  Tuvalu  it is climate change.” Climate change is undoubtedly an issue of extreme importance to a small  atoll nation like Tuvalu. The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlights the extreme vulnerability of island countries like Tuvalu to the impacts of climate change and the urgent necessity for global action to address this vulnerability. In this context the coming session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bali will be very important.   In our view  the Conference in Bali should have the following components: First  it should reconfirm the important role of the Kyoto Protocol and encourage parties to the Protocol to pledge new and substantial emissions reductions and encourage others to become a party to it.   Secondly  we should agree to amend the Kyoto Protocol so that we open the door for newly industrialized countries  countries with economies in transition and any other interested countries  including developing countries  to take on commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  Thirdly  we must commit to a new global framework on adaptation to the impacts of climate change. For highly vulnerable countries like Tuvalu this is an essential step in the process.  Lastly  we must agree on a new negotiation process under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that will establish a new legal agreement to allow developing countries to make voluntary commitments to reduce their emissions. Under this agreement we envisage that developing countries will be able to make voluntary commitments to reduce emissions from the energy  transport and forestry sectors. These commitments would be linked to appropriate incentive mechanisms.   In the context of reducing emissions from deforestation we believe that any agreed measures must bring about real reductions in global emissions. Actions to reduce emissions from deforestation should not undermine or devalue efforts to reduce emissions from other sectors. Furthermore  these actions should not infringe upon the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities. The causes of deforestation are complex  particularly as there are serious governance issues to resolve. Let us make sure to get a durable solution to this issue that will achieve a lasting climate change outcome.   There are a number of elements that we think are essential in a new global framework on adaptation. We elaborated some of these during the High-Level Event on Climate Change. Let me highlight two: First  we must establish a whole new source of funding for adaptation and a new approach on how adaptation funding is managed. A potential new source of funding for adaptation could come from a tax levied on international aviation and maritime transport. Secondly  we must establish a global insurance facility to help assist vulnerable countries recover from the impacts of climate change.   We must seize the opportunity at Bali. We must set ourselves a short timeframe to create a new legally binding agreement on climate change. This should not undermine the Kyoto Protocol but should build on its strengths. Those countries that have turned their backs on the Kyoto Protocol must now take part in the global effort and commit to reducing their emissions within a tight timeframe. Once this is done  then we will see the rest of the world move forward  for it is crucial that all countries must make an effort to reduce their emissions. We must not waste the opportunity at Bali.   In conclusion  my Government encourages all countries to support the reform agenda for the United Nations including the serious consideration of self-determination and the universal participation of all nations. We strongly encourage all Governments to use the next climate change Conference of the Parties in Bali to be a starting point for new negotiations on climate change. The future of Tuvalu and lives of many others like us is at stake. "
"175",7074,"TZA",62,2007,"Let me begin by  congratulating Mr. Kerim for his well deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. He can count on Tanzania’s full support and cooperation as he discharges his mandate. I also commend his predecessor  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  for having skilfully presided over the sixty-first session.  We also congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his unanimous election as the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations  which reflects his distinguished diplomatic track record  integrity and commitment to international diplomacy. I thank him for the honour and trust he has bestowed upon my country  by appointing an accomplished Tanzanian academic and diplomat to the post of Deputy-Secretary-General. I take this opportunity to once again congratulate Ms. Asha-Rose Migiro  for her appointment to that high office. I trust that such a combination of diligence and devoted leadership will steer this important institution towards greater heights of success.   I highly commend the Secretary-General for his decision to convene the High-Level Event on Climate Change four days ago. The meeting gave us an opportunity to discuss the state of health of our common planet. It also gave us the opportunity to renew our commitment to take the necessary steps to correct the mistakes we have made. It is indisputable and is attributable  by and large  to human activities.  Unfortunately Africa and many small island States contribute the least to the greenhouse gases that cause this phenomenon and yet suffer the most from the impact of climate change. Climate change can also adversely affect our abilities to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It also threatens to undo the results of many decades of development efforts.   I wish to emphasize that international collective action is critical in developing an effective response to global warming. Indeed  a review process to consider further commitment on the part of the Parties under the Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012 is urgent and necessary. Tanzania promises to participate actively in the Bali Conference.   Tanzania welcomes the recent milestones in the United Nations reform process  namely the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  the Human Rights Council and the Central Emergency Response Fund. We attach great importance to these new initiatives  and we want to contribute to their success.   In its report of November 2006 entitled  “Delivering as One”  the High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence made valuable recommendations  including the establishment of a “One United Nations” system at the country level. We in Tanzania believe that the development coordination agenda is best served when we have one programme  one budgetary framework  one leader and one office at the country level. Tanzania is pleased to be among the eight “One United Nations” pilot countries. The One United Nations Initiative is a logical development from the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)  a framework that is fully aligned with our national priorities. The efficiencies in aid delivery expected through “One United Nations” will certainly contribute to enhancing our capacity to attain the MDGs.  I call upon Member States to give our Organization  the United Nations  the resources it needs to implement this pilot project. The project should not fail for lack of resources. I also urge the Bretton Woods institutions to take a keener interest in this initiative and join in the efforts to realize its objectives.  The need to make the Security Council more representative is an age-old demand we all share. We need to move from rhetoric to action. Now is the time. Tanzania assures the entire United Nations membership of our wholehearted support and cooperation in this process.  We are now almost halfway through the timeline of 2015 set for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Yet  we are not halfway in realizing the targets as spelt out at the Millennium Summit of 2000. We are in this unfortunate state of affairs because the additional resources expected and promised by the developed countries have not been delivered. I urge this Assembly to renew its appeal to the developed nations to deliver on their promise.  In this regard  we welcome the initiative mentored by the Norwegian Prime Minister  Mr. Jens Stoltenberg  to launch a global campaign to mobilize resources for achieving Goal No. 4 on reducing infant mortality rates and Goal No. 5 on reducing maternal mortality rates. Tanzania supports the effort and we are happy to be associated with it. I appeal to all Members to support the initiative. It is our hope that developed nations will support the campaign by providing the requisite resources.   In the same vein  we commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for establishing the MDG Africa Steering Group. Africa is excited about it  and we trust that it will give new impetus in assisting Africa attain the Millennium Development Goals.   We also welcome the historic decision taken by the President of the General Assembly to convene a special summit of leaders to discuss the MDGs during this session. We support this wise decision of our President  for we believe it will provide the needed momentum for the timely achievement of the MDGs in Africa. Tanzania promises to participate actively in this important meeting.   We are happy with the tremendous progress made in Burundi. Peace has been restored  and life has come back to normal. Tanzania will continue to work with the region and South Africa to ensure the full operationalization of the peace agreement signed between the Burundi Government and the Parti Liberation du Peuple Hutu   Forces nationales de liberation (PALIPEHUTU-FNL) rebel group.   We are concerned with the fluidity of the situation in North Kivu. We hope wisdom will prevail on the parties concerned to give peace a chance. The people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo deserve peace; they have missed it for too long. We in Tanzania promise to play whatever part may be required of us.  With peace restored in Burundi and many parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  it is incumbent upon us in the international community to encourage and assist refugees to go back to their respective countries. That is what the tripartite commissions  involving Tanzania  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the respective countries of Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  have been doing. Our joint commissions have been encouraging the repatriation of refugees on a voluntary basis  and we have been assisting those who have come forward. The results are encouraging  but things could be better. A word of encouragement from the Organization could make a difference.  Tanzania believes that the return of refugees to their countries of origin  after peace has been restored  is a sovereign right that should not be denied. It is also the ultimate testimony to and guarantor of peace that has been attained. It is not fair   it is not right   for people to continue to live in refugee camps after peace has been restored in their countries of origin.  The progress currently being made with regard to Darfur gives us hope. The adoption of Security Council resolution 1769 (2007)  on the deployment of a hybrid force from the African Union and the United Nations  and the renewed political dialogue among the parties to the conflict hold promise for the stalled peace process and for the humanitarian crisis that unfortunately persists there. Tanzania applauds the unique partnership which has evolved between the African Union and the United Nations. We stand ready to contribute troops to the hybrid force.  We are encouraged by the recent developments with regard to internal political dialogue in Somalia. We are equally happy with the attention given to Somalia by the Security Council and the Secretary-General. We welcome the recent Security Council resolution 1772 (2007)  which supports the political process in Somalia and the role of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). We commend Uganda’s contribution of peacekeepers to Somalia and the good work they have been doing so far. As a member of the International Contact Group on Somalia  Tanzania promises to continue to be proactive and offers to contribute in the training of the Somali military.  The United Nations should remain seized of the issue of Western Sahara. Tanzania reaffirms its support for the inalienable right of the Saharawi people to decide and choose the way forward. We urge the United Nations to intensify its efforts to find an honourable and just solution to this long-standing decolonization issue.  The crisis inside the Palestinian territories is unfortunate; it is a matter of great concern to many of us. Tanzania remains supportive of efforts aimed at creating two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side and at peace with each other. This presents  in our view  the best hope for sustainable peace in the region. We applaud and welcome the renewed international interest and efforts being expended in line with the relevant United Nations resolutions.  In conclusion  Tanzania reaffirms its belief in and commitment to multilateralism and the United Nations. The Assembly can count on Tanzania’s continued support to this Organization and the ideals for which it stands. "
"176",7117,"UGA",62,2007,"Allow me at the outset to extend our congratulations to Mr. Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I wish to thank most sincerely his predecessor  Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Khalifa of Bahrain  for the able manner in which she handled the vital business of the sixty-first session. I also wish to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his leadership of our Organization  and most especially for his untiring efforts in favour of conflict resolution and peace on the African continent and elsewhere.  Sixty-two years ago  the founding fathers of the United Nations came together  determined  in the words of the Charter  “to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples”. The Organization they created was to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common goals. Today humankind is faced with a common threat in the form of climate change. The General Assembly’s choice of responding to climate change as the theme for this session is timely. It will help draw attention to the global challenge for which no single country has a solution. It is only through concerted and sustained international cooperation that action to combat the effects and further escalation of climate change can be taken.  There is no doubt that climate change is the biggest danger facing humankind  especially the poor. The threat of extreme conditions  including floods and drought  is a major concern. It has many implications for development  particularly for agrarian communities with fewer resources to cope with additional stresses and shocks brought about by this phenomenon. The increasing frequency and severity of prolonged drought threaten water supplies to millions of people in poor countries  as well as agriculture which is overwhelmingly subsistence and rain-fed and  therefore  vulnerable to climate variability and change.  The vulnerability of the health sector has also been evident as frequent floods result in outbreaks of waterborne diseases  such as cholera  typhoid  dysentery and the increased incidence of malaria.  Indeed  climate change today constitutes a danger to human security  considering the effects of climate change on the very existence of some small island States and coastal cities  as well as the devastation by hurricanes and typhoons.  Several years ago  the world was alerted to the danger of climate change. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  a number of actions were agreed upon. We all agreed to undertake a three-pronged approach  including development  access to appropriate technology  mitigation and adaptation. It is unfortunate that  so far  no meaningful actions have been undertaken to implement these agreed interventions.  My delegation believes that the time is now to implement these high-priority activities. We should  however  recognize that responding to climate change will require political leadership at all levels  starting from the centre and extending to the grassroots. Increasing collaborative action on adaptation is urgently needed  so that vulnerable countries and communities can cope with the unavoidable impact of climate change. Reforestation efforts and control of greenhouse gas emissions are urgent actions that we can undertake together. However  reforestation on its own will not produce the desired results without adequate investment in renewable energy sources as a measure against the massive depletion of forests for fuel. Developed countries should encourage companies to invest in hydro-electric power generation and other clean energy sources in developing countries. For such projects to be undertaken  measures such as a successful fifteenth International Development Association replenishment is critical. We all must learn to safeguard and use available resources sparingly for the sake of future generations.  Uganda considers the United Nations Climate Change Conference  to be held in Bali  Indonesia  this December  to be critical in the development of a long-term response to climate change. It is an opportunity to begin concrete negotiations on a global strategy that is acceptable to all and implementable. Prior to Bali  however  this Assembly should agree on guiding principles that can help bring together all relevant aspects of the problem. The industrialized countries should take the lead in cutting emissions  while developing countries will have to pursue low-emission development strategies and benefit from incentives for assistance for adaptation and for limiting emissions. We must commit ourselves to an approach that balances adaptation and mitigation  underpinned by adequate financing arrangements and investments in new and innovative technologies.  As Members of the United Nations  our countries share a vision of a better standard of life  in larger freedom  as enshrined in our Charter. We are  however  challenged by a persistence of poverty in many of our countries. Recent statistics indicate that  worldwide  1.2 billion people live on one dollar a day  while 2.8 billion survive on less than two dollars. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen  both within States and among States.  The World Bank reported in 2003 that average income in the wealthiest 20 countries is 37 times that of the poorest 20  which is twice the ratio of what it was in 1970. Many countries  especially those in sub-Saharan Africa  ended the last decade with lower per capita incomes than at its beginning. Poverty is one of the biggest threats to international peace  security and the environment.  At the Millennium Summit  world leaders expressed their determination to halve world poverty by the year 2015. The midpoint progress report on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that was released in July this year indicates that countries in Africa and elsewhere are proving that large-scale progress in achieving the MDGs is possible under conditions of adequate financing  much of which should flow from a strengthened global partnership for development. It is critical that the Monterrey targets be met.  As we respond to climate change  the fight against poverty remains an integral part of the effort. Unless we address poverty in developing countries  the poor will continue to destroy the environment by cutting trees for firewood and employing poor agricultural practices.  There are time-tested ways to bring people out of poverty. Trade liberalization and export-led growth have the potential to lift millions out of poverty. However  to benefit from trade  developing countries must add value to their raw materials and sell them as finished products  taking advantage of appropriate value chains. That will not only increase earnings but create jobs  thus ending the mass migrations to the developed countries. They should develop their human resources through education and better health services. Education is a critical factor in transforming society. An educated middle class with adequate income to spend is critical for industrialization and the transition of societies. That has happened in some countries of South-East Asia; it can happen elsewhere in the developing world. As a priority  agriculture needs to be commercialized. Related to that is the urgent need for regional integration so as to enlarge markets.  Under heavy pressure  many developing countries have removed trade barriers  while the developed countries have not reciprocated in such key areas as agriculture and textiles  where the former have a comparative advantage. Is it not absurd that a cow in the European Union gets a daily subsidy of $2.2  while 40 per cent of the world’s population lives on less than $2 a day? The World Bank estimates that protectionism by the developed world costs developing countries $100 billion annually. A fair system will require appropriate measures to deal with the unfair trade privileges of developed countries that hinder market access. It is vital that the stalled trade talks under the Doha Development Round be resumed and successfully concluded.  Peace and security are necessary conditions for sustainable development. The rise in inter- and intra-State conflict has been the hallmark of the post-cold-war era. Internal conflicts have spilled over borders to create regional instability. Internal displacement has taken place  and equally alarming has been the international refugee crisis that has resulted from such conflicts. In some countries  central authority has collapsed  creating havens for terrorists and drug traffickers  with the attendant threats to international peace and security. No meaningful actions against poverty and in favour of environmental protection can take place in that kind of atmosphere.  The President returned to the Chair.  Most of Africa is now peaceful  and democracy is being consolidated through regular elections  the observance of human rights and constitutionalism. However  there are some areas that require urgent international attention. There is a need to ensure peace and stability in Darfur in accordance with the internationally agreed framework under Security Council resolution 1769 (2007). Further attention should be given to supporting the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in the South.  In Somalia  the General Assembly should support an all-inclusive peace and reconciliation process and the Africa Union Military Observer Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) with the necessary resources to facilitate the peacekeeping. Uganda has honoured its pledge of troops for peacekeeping; we call on other countries that made similar pledges to fulfil them. The international effort in Somalia should focus on capacity-building to empower the Somali people to solve their own problems. We also call on the Secretary-General to finalize plans for possible deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force to replace AMISOM  as called for in Security Council resolution 1772 (2007).  In the Great Lakes region  various efforts are under way to improve peace and security and to create an atmosphere conducive to development. Through the Tripartite Plus One Commission  bringing together the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Rwanda  Burundi and Uganda  we have agreed on a framework and actions to deal with negative forces that pose a threat to peace and security in the region. In that regard  we refer to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and to provisions of Security Council resolution 1756 (2007). The Security Council should reinforce the mandate and the means of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to enable it effectively to work with Congolese armed forces to totally eradicate the threat of negative forces operating in the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  In northern Uganda  we are holding peace talks with the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA). Of the five agenda items  two agreements have been concluded and signed. Those are the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and an agreement on comprehensive solutions. However  the LRA has not met any of the terms of the very first Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities. For example  it is stipulated that LRA forces assemble at Ri-Kwangba in southern Sudan; they have  however  not done so to date. They are still camped in Garamba National park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We urge the international community to bring adequate pressure to bear on the LRA to assemble at Ri-Kwangba and to set a time frame for the talks. Talks cannot go on forever. As we inch towards a comprehensive peace agreement  international support and understanding are required to balance the need for durable peace and stability on the one hand  and the imperative for justice on the other.  I wish to assure the General Assembly that Uganda is fully aware of its obligations under the Rome Statute and cannot undermine it. We cannot condone impunity. To that end  we are working closely with the International Criminal Court to ensure accountability under the complementarity stipulations. Uganda will be convening a Consultative Group meeting later this year to mobilize resources and coordinate actions for the post-conflict reconciliation programme in northern Uganda. The international community is invited to support that programme.  When you chose “Responding to climate change” as the theme for this session  Sir  I believe you intended to have this session consider and recommend ways of addressing that common threat. You believed  as indeed we do  that a world that pays no attention to that problem is fatally damaging the interests of future generations. Addressing climate change will involve fighting poverty  ensuring peace and security  and investing in clean energy  especially in developing countries. This session should be the turning point at which we all come together and agree on ways to save our planet. "
"177",7164,"UKR",62,2007,"Allow me  first of all  to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to the high post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. On behalf of my delegation  let me wish you  sir  every success in your important mission and assure you of our full support.  I would like to extend warm words of appreciation to your predecessor  Mrs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain  whose extensive diplomatic experience and skilful guidance throughout the sixty-first session greatly contributed to its success.  Allow me also to take this opportunity to express our support for the ambitious plans and consistent efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  to re-energize the Organization  strengthen its capacity and update the United Nations system in the new century.  International terrorism remains one of the most serious threats facing humankind today. Last year the General Assembly  by adopting the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  made a concrete contribution to combat terrorism in a coordinated manner at the national  regional and international levels. We believe that the adoption of a definition of terrorism during the current session would be a starting point in assessing counter-terrorism measures taken by each State.  My country joined the anti-terrorist coalition at its inception and has made a significant contribution to its activities. In the last five years  all 13 international counter-terrorism treaties have been ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament.  On the governmental level  we support international anti-terrorist efforts  in particular  through participation in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. This fall  we plan to organize in Ukraine the third international forum on measures to counteract acts of nuclear terrorism with the participation of civil society  scholars and non-governmental organizations.   Disarmament and non-proliferation are among the most important challenges on our agenda. As a country that voluntarily renounced its military nuclear arsenals  Ukraine is truly disappointed that a world without weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) remains a distant dream.  The international community continues to be intimidated by the threat of WMD proliferation. The strengthening of international legal norms and political instrument to prevent WMD proliferation remains a top priority. In this regard  I would like to stress the importance of the universalization of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  as well as the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Commemorating in 2007 the tenth anniversary of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)  Ukraine is ready to contribute to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) efforts on ensuring universal adherence to the CWC  particularly by Middle East countries.  With this in mind  Ukraine proposes to host next year  together with the OPCW  an international conference with the participation of  inter alia  countries from the Middle East and North Africa. The anticipated outcome of such a conference might be a joint statement of the intention of the countries concerned to adhere to the CWC.  We are convinced that the only way forward is to make simultaneous progress in the areas of both non-proliferation and disarmament.  We cannot but underscore our concerns over the recent tendencies that have already caused the erosion of the multilateral regime in the arms control and disarmament spheres with a negative impact on mutual trust and confidence among States. The very recent events around the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe have seriously put into question the future of this important arms control instrument  widely recognized as the cornerstone of European security.  Speaking about global peace and security  I cannot but draw attention to the problem of the protracted conflicts in the GUAM Group area. These conflicts create instability and insecurity and constitute a threat to peace in the region. There is no doubt that these conflicts endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries of the region  while also hampering their economic and social development.  We are concerned that numerous international efforts to settle those conflicts have yielded no results. It is crucially important that the world community continue taking practical steps to that end. In our opinion  the United Nations  regional organizations and other relevant mechanisms should harmoniously complement one another  using their comparative advantages in peacemaking efforts.  In this context  I would like to stress Ukraine’s unequivocal support for a lasting settlement in Kosovo. That objective cannot be achieved by undertaking unilateral steps nor by steps seeking to bypass the United Nations. A hasty settlement can only destabilize the situation in the region and have negative implications for the entire system of international relations  since similar scenarios could be pursued by separatist entities in other regions.  Ukraine has always supported United Nations peacekeeping efforts  both politically and practically. We are glad to note that the recent noticeable increase in peacekeeping activities has taken place in accordance with the reform strategy of Peace Operations 2010. That is especially important in light of the ongoing and expected deployments in the future. In this context  Ukraine supports the Secretary-General in his efforts to strengthen the United Nations capacity to manage and sustain peace operations.  I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that next year will mark the sixtieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping operations. In this regard  our delegation proposes to adopt  at the sixty-third session of the General Assembly  a special declaration to commemorate this event.  United Nations credibility will always be measured by its ability to respond adequately to various threats in all regions of the world. No organization is better equipped to deal with those issues. The United Nations should lead multilateral efforts with a view to reaching solutions in the interest of all. But  to address them effectively  we need to take further steps in reforming and improving existing mechanisms of the United Nations in order to make this Organization more relevant in the twenty-first century.  Unfortunately  the process of reforming the Security Council  which is the key element within the process of renewing the United Nations  is still only an agenda item. We are of the view that the reform process can only benefit from new  creative approaches that will eventually bring about tangible results. In this regard  I would like  once again  to stress Ukraine’s position that one of the necessary elements of Security Council reform should be the allocation of an additional non-permanent seat to the Group of Eastern European and other States  whose membership has more than doubled since 1991.  In today’s world  adherence to sound economic  social and environmental policies and good governance are the key factors in achieving sustainable development. We share the view  expressed in a number of statements during this session  that sustainable development is a global challenge. Ukraine believes that only through concerted efforts  using universal  multilateral mechanisms as well as regional and subregional forums  will those challenges be adequately addressed.  For Ukraine and other countries of the region  the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation has become an important element in achieving internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals.   At the same time  the forces of nature  complemented by reckless and irresponsible human behaviour can disrupt development plans  reshape continents and even wipe out whole countries from the world’s map. Science has shown  on many occasions  that climate change  global warming and pollution may cause sudden and dramatic consequences if not addressed in timely  proper and effective ways. Ukraine is firmly committed to the international agreements in the area of climate change  including the United Nations Framework Convention to Combat Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.  This year  we marked the twenty-first anniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe  the worst technological disaster ever faced by humankind. Chernobyl severely affected my country and the entire region. We call upon United Nations agencies and individual donors to continue to provide assistance to the affected States and to work together on the implementation of the relevant programmes in a spirit of cooperation.  Ukraine  as a 2007 coordinator of the Chernobyl Agenda  has proposed  together with the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation  the adoption at the sixty-second United Nations General Assembly session  of a new resolution on strengthening international cooperation to mitigate the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. In this regard  we would welcome broad support for that initiative during this General Assembly session.  Ukraine is approaching the seventy-fifth anniversary of one of the most tragic pages in its history   the Holodomor   or Great Famine. The artificial famine of 1932-33  perpetrated by the Soviet totalitarian regime for the purpose of annihilating the rural population  the backbone of the Ukrainian nation  took the lives of millions of innocent people. For more than seven decades this horrific crime  which ranks among the worst catastrophes ever experienced by humankind  still awaits adequate international condemnation.   We sincerely hope that the United Nations  as a collective moral authority and effective instrument in safeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms  will raise its voice and denounce the horrendous disaster that was purposely inflicted on the Ukrainian population in the early 1930s. By doing so  due tribute will be paid to honour the memory of millions of our compatriots who were outrageously deprived of their lives. It is important to remember the past in order to learn from it and to avoid repeating crimes against humankind in the future.  A decision of the General Assembly to establish an international day of remembrance of victims of genocide would be a worthwhile and timely contribution to the attainment of that goal. Likewise  it could facilitate the effective implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  as the world approaches the sixtieth anniversary of those instruments in 2008. We are confident that this event deserves the adoption of a special resolution.   In the context of human rights  Ukraine attaches great importance to the harmonious coexistence of civilizations  dialogue and cooperation among various cultures and peoples. In this regard  we support the Alliance of Civilizations established under the initiative of the Prime Ministers of Spain and Turkey  and we intend to join the Group of Friends of the Alliance in the near future.  The problems before us are daunting. We believe that the United Nations is the only Organization with the worldwide membership  global reach and universal legitimacy needed to address today’s global threats and challenges  which no country can resolve on its own.  I take this opportunity to reaffirm Ukraine’s readiness to continue making an active contribution to the further strengthening of our Organization. "
"178",7211,"URY",62,2007,"I  wish to congratulate Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.   On behalf of my country  Uruguay  I would like to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and to all of those who today are paying their respects and are celebrating this International Day of Non-Violence.   The Eastern Republic of Uruguay would like to begin by reiterating its ongoing commitment to the principles and guidelines which are and will continue to be at the very core of its international activity: the sovereign equality of States  the rejection of the use of force or the threat of the use of force  peaceful settlement of international disputes  attachment to and support for institutions of international law  support for international law itself  non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  the self-determination of peoples  the promotion of human rights  international cooperation in economic and social matters  and support for multilateralism and for the quest for collective answers based on consensus and respect for law  and within the framework of the principles of the United Nations Charter   which means the rejection of any attempt to impose the will of one State over that of others.  Achieving these principles is sometimes impeded by the attitude of a few dominant States that impose illegitimate decisions  provoking conflicts that involve a large part of humankind and affect the weakest countries. But above all  they weaken the legal and political authority of the United Nations. It is clear today that lying behind those attitudes we can discern hegemonic economic interests.   In accordance with the suggestion of the President  we will address the proposed agenda  beginning with climate change.  At the High-level Dialogue here on 24 September  Uruguay expressed its opinions and referred to various aspects of this problem that lead to a serious and paradoxical situation for less developed countries: even though they do not contribute significantly to global warming  they are the ones that suffer the most and are the most vulnerable to its affects.   Regrettably  as we all know  there are highly industrialized countries responsible for emitting millions of tons of gas that cause global warming and climate change  which  however  do not seem ready to reduce their emissions nor to cooperate with the international community to compensate for these effects. We must call upon those countries to sign the Kyoto Protocol and to contribute  in a way that is proportionate to their responsibility in generating this problem  so that this struggle can be carried forward by all the nations of our planet in solidarity.   For basically agricultural and fishing countries such as Uruguay and many other undeveloped countries  climate is a decisive factor for development. The dramatic climate variations that are increasingly notorious constitute a serious threat for their possibilities for progress and the well-being of their populations. This is why our countries have affirmed that temporary aid and depending on the goodwill of rich countries when faced with specific catastrophes does not accomplish much. Rather  we need effective measures to be adopted from now on to prevent these catastrophes and commitments that are to be made now in order to avoid continuing to create the conditions that produce these catastrophes.  In considering the topic of financing for development  we should begin with the following question. What have been the causes of underdevelopment  economic and political dependency and poverty for billions of people  most of whom live in the southern part of the planet?   Looking for such financing  we tend to immediately think of financial organizations like the World Bank  or those which  in order to maintain budgets   that is  economic and social programmes   reflecting fiscal imbalances  have for decades prescribed economic formulas  such as those applied by the International Monetary Fund  which instead of leading to development have destroyed the productive apparatus of entire regions of the planet  thus generating unemployment  increasing poverty and concentrating wealth.   My country  along with other countries of the South American region  the Cairns Group and the Group of 22  has been saying for two decades that it is important to have just standards of trade rather than preaching about the unconditional opening of markets on the pretext of free trade while simultaneously practising the crudest and most ruthless protection of the world’s predominant systems of production and stubbornly refusing to comply with part V of the Agreement on Agriculture  annexed to the Marrakesh Agreement  whose objectives include the elimination of subsidies and the opening up of markets. Unfortunately  we have not managed to convince the United States and the European Union of this.   To put it briefly and concisely  developing countries do not need to be “helped”; they need guarantees of free access to markets and  in particular  the elimination of domestic production subsidies  which violate the competitiveness guarantees  which are so highly touted. It is in agriculture that the southern countries are highly competitive and produce consumer goods of high quality  generally free of genetic modification. Real free trade would not make them turn to international credit and would enable them to generate their own resources to finance their own development  integrate their economies  to expand their markets  create their own multilateral credit institutions and diversify their products and  as a result  their markets.   Uruguay is the Chairman pro tempore of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) and we firmly believe in the regional integration of all of the countries of South America. That is their strategic option in foreign policy.   Our South America possesses all of the natural resources that we find in the world; we have energy reserves for more than 100 years; we have the potential to produce food for 4 billion people; we have the largest global freshwater reserves; we have major mineral resources. Hence  we can make decisive economic and social progress  with a view to eliminating poverty.   But despite all of that  we face an absurd and criminal situation: out of 400 million people in South America  200 million live under the poverty threshold; there are areas of the continent where there are extremely high rates of infant mortality. Life expectancy for part of that population is practically half of what it is in developed countries.   We cannot forget that in today’s world South America is a factor of peace and political stability. All of the current Governments of South America have been democratically elected. Both in MERCOSUR and in its associated States  we have adopted the so-called democratic clause that says that a country can belong to these integration systems only if it respects democratic principles.   That is why  after 200 years of non-integration  we will tenaciously defend that achievement   so that anti-democratic and destabilizing interference will fail and so that the continent of hope  as we call it  can have an impact on the world to affirm peace and respect for international law  democratic stability  fundamental freedoms and human rights  which with great sacrifice these people have recovered after decades of a doctrine focusing on national security.   Uruguay reaffirms its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In order to achieve them  we need greater social justice  a better distribution of wealth and the gradual establishment of new criteria that would place the economy at the service of humankind instead of being a factor of slavery and poverty for a large part of humankind   a tool that is used for the excessive enrichment of privileged groups.   Our country knows the difficulties that all developing nations face in working towards those objectives. The current Uruguayan Government inherited a country that had experienced the worst crisis in its history  with levels of poverty affecting 1 million people out of a population of 3.5 million people; in tens of thousands of cases poverty reached the levels of abject poverty. All of this was the result of the application of a foreign economic model which was contrary to the interests of the region and its people.   Tackling this reality meant not only medium-term and long-term productive development measures  but also emergency social measures. Thus  in 2005 we implemented an emergency plan which in two years reduced the number of poor by 120 000  eliminated abject poverty and helped to socially reintegrate a large percentage of those who had been affected.   The Government is moving forward with a social equity plan  which involves the integration of more than 500 000 people   one seventh of the population   into the national health system  which is also being substantially modified. It also includes benefits of roughly $40 per month to all children who go to primary school and roughly $45 per month for those who attend secondary or technical school. All of this will help bring about a positive process of social inclusion.   Likewise  laws are being considered to transform the entire educational sector and which are also aimed at achieving the MDGs. At present  school is mandatory from the age of 4 and special attention is being paid to dealing with the problem of dropouts.  For Uruguay  no type of terrorism is acceptable or justifiable: neither State terrorism  which we experienced during the 1970s and 1980s and which became a national security doctrine  nor the terrorism that is practiced by some groups to further their social  political  religious or other demands  claiming victims who  in the end  are always innocent people.   In the United Nations context  Uruguay is a party to all United Nations-system counter-terrorism conventions. We have submitted the relevant reports to all United Nations committees in this area.   Uruguay is concerned both by acts of terrorism and by their underlying causes. These include the promotion of hate based on cultural  political  racial or religious differences; the talk of a so-called inevitable clash of civilizations; military invasions; and the persistence of difficult conditions for part of populations living in occupied territories. Interventionism and non-compliance with United Nations resolutions to resolve conflicts are causing an increase in extremism and religious fanaticism among such peoples and seem to be the factors that have contributed most to the worsening and proliferation of terrorist attacks.   Uruguay calls for all cultures and peoples to come together in a respectful dialogue so that what is different or foreign will not be a reason for aggression  discrimination  subjugation or hatred. We fully support the initiative of Spain and Turkey: the Alliance of Civilizations.   In the view of Uruguay  peacekeeping in conflict zones is an essential mission not only of the United Nations  but also of all countries wishing to cooperate in building a safer world where peace and cooperation are the norm. Our country currently takes part in 12 of the 15 peacekeeping missions of the Organization deployed in Africa  America  Asia and Europe. Despite the fact that we have only 3.5 million people  we are the seventh largest troop contributor to those operations and we are the greatest per-capita troop contributor in the world.   Uruguay has acquired experience in matters linked to peacebuilding and reconstruction in areas devastated by conflict  and offers electoral assistance to States as well.  With respect to United Nations reform  Uruguay believes it is a priority to strengthen mechanisms to eliminate the resort to preventive wars  interventionism and unilateral actions that are undertaken without taking into account the opinion of the international community. Uruguay also expresses its full support for the new Human Rights Council  in which we have been honoured to serve as one of the Vice-Presidents. With respect to Security Council reform  we hope that in the current session we will be able to move forward on the basis of a consensus. Uruguay supports the inclusion of Brazil as a permanent member  as well as that of India  Germany and Japan  and an increase in the number of non-permanent members.   The effectiveness of the United Nations is a topic that concerns us. Uruguay is one of the countries that have been chosen for the “One United Nations” pilot plan  within the framework of the recommendations of the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence. The Government of Uruguay has committed itself to carrying out this pilot project in coordination with the United Nations agencies in Uruguay  defining three strategic areas as the basis of that coordination: State reform  especially in health  education and development strategies; decentralized development  with civic participation; and policies to eradicate poverty and structural inequities.   Lastly  Uruguay believes that all United Nations Member States must abandon patterns that date back to the Second World War and develop organizational standards for the General Assembly  the Security Council and the other principal organs of the United Nations. Member States should establish conditions that would bring the United Nations into the twenty-first century  thus guaranteeing peace and providing a forum in which to promote a dignified life for peoples along the axis of freedom  which is the basis for justice. "
"179",7258,"USA",62,2007,"Thank you for the opportunity to address the General Assembly of the United Nations.   Sixty years ago  representatives from 16 nations gathered to begin deliberations on a new international bill of rights. The document they produced is called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and it stands as a landmark achievement in the history of human liberty. The Declaration opens by recognizing the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom and justice and peace in the world. As we gather for the sixty-second session of the General Assembly  the standards of the Declaration must guide our work in this world.   Achieving the promise of the Declaration requires confronting long-term threats. It also requires answering the immediate needs of today.  We nations in this Hall have our differences. Yet  there are some areas where we can all agree. When innocent people are trapped in a life of murder and fear  the Declaration is not being upheld. When millions of children starve to death or perish from a mosquito bite  we are not doing our duty in the world. When whole societies are cut off from the prosperity of the global economy  we are all worse off. Changing these underlying conditions is what the Declaration calls the work of larger freedom  and it must be the work of every nation in this Assembly.  This great institution must work for great purposes  to free people from tyranny and violence  hunger and disease  illiteracy and ignorance and poverty and despair. Every member of the United Nations must join in this mission of liberation. The first mission of the United Nations requires liberating people from tyranny and violence. The first article of the Universal Declaration begins by stating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. This truth is denied by terrorists and extremists who kill the innocent with the aim of imposing their hateful vision on humanity. The followers of this violent ideology are a threat to civilized people everywhere. All civilized nations must work together to stop them by sharing intelligence about their networks and choking off their finances and bringing to justice their operatives. In the long run  the best way to defeat extremists is to defeat their dark ideology with a more hopeful vision   the vision of liberty that founded this body.  The United States salutes the nations that have recently taken strides towards liberty  including Ukraine  Georgia  Kyrgyzstan  Mauritania  Liberia  Sierra Leone and Morocco. The Palestinian territories have moderate leaders   mainstream leaders   who are working to build free institutions that fight terror  enforce the law and respond to the needs of their people. The international community must support these leaders so that we can advance the vision of two democratic States   Israel and Palestine   living side by side in peace and security.  Brave citizens in Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq have made the choice for democracy. Yet  the extremists have responded by targeting them for murder. This is not a show of strength; it is evidence of fear; and the extremists are doing everything within their power to bring down these young democracies. The people of Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq have asked for our help  and every civilized nation has a responsibility to stand with them. Every civilized nation also has a responsibility to stand up for the people suffering under dictatorship. In Belarus  North Korea  Syria and Iran  brutal regimes deny their people the fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration.  Americans are outraged by the situation in Burma  where a military junta has imposed a 19-year reign of fear. Basic freedoms of speech  assembly and worship are severely restricted. Ethnic minorities are persecuted. Forced child labour  human trafficking and rape are common. The regime is holding more than 1 000 political prisoners  including Aung San Suu Kyi  whose party was elected overwhelmingly by the Burmese people in 1990.  The ruling junta remains unyielding  yet the people’s desire for freedom is unmistakable. This morning  I am announcing a series of steps to help bring peaceful change to Burma. The United States will tighten economic sanctions on the leaders of the regime and their financial backers. We will impose an expanded visa ban on those responsible for the most egregious violations of human rights   as well as their family members. We will continue to support the efforts of humanitarian groups working to alleviate suffering in Burma. And I urge the United Nations and all nations to use their diplomatic and economic leverage to help the Burmese people reclaim their freedom.  In Cuba  the long rule of a cruel dictator is nearing its end. The Cuban people are ready for their freedom. And as that nation enters a period of transition  the United Nations must insist on free speech  free assembly and  ultimately  free and competitive elections.  In Zimbabwe  ordinary citizens suffer under a tyrannical regime. The Government has cracked down on peaceful calls for reform and has forced millions to flee their homeland. The behaviour of the Mugabe regime is an assault on its people and an affront to the principles of the Universal Declaration. The United Nations must insist on change in Harare and must insist on freedom for the people of Zimbabwe.  In Sudan  innocent civilians are suffering repression; and in the Darfur region  many are losing their lives to genocide. America has responded with tough sanctions against those responsible for the violence. We have provided more than $2 billion in humanitarian and peacekeeping aid. I look forward to attending a Security Council meeting that will focus on Darfur  chaired by the French President. I appreciate France’s leadership in helping to stabilize Sudan’s neighbours. The United Nations must answer this challenge to conscience and live up to its promise to promptly deploy peacekeeping forces to Darfur.  Secondly  the mission of the United Nations requires liberating people from hunger and disease. Article 25 of the Universal Declaration states that everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family  including food  clothing  housing  and medical care. Around the world  the United Nations is carrying out noble efforts to live up to these words.  Feeding the hungry has long been a special calling for my nation. Today  more than half the world’s food assistance comes from America. We send emergency food stocks to starving people  from camps in Sudan to slums around the world. I have proposed an innovative initiative to alleviate hunger under which America would purchase the crops of local farmers in Africa and elsewhere  rather than shipping in food from the developed world. This would help build up local agriculture and break the cycle of famine in the developing world  and I urge our United States Congress to support this initiative.  Many in this Hall are bringing the spirit of generosity to fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria. Five years ago  in sub-Saharan Africa  an AIDS diagnosis was widely considered a death sentence  and fewer than 50 000 people infected with the virus were receiving treatment. The world responded by creating the Global Fund  which is working with Governments and the private sector to fight the disease around the world. The United States decided to take these efforts a step further by launching the $15 billion Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Since 2003  this effort has helped bring cutting-edge medicines to more than a million people in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a good start. So earlier this year  I proposed to double our initial commitment   to $30 billion. By coming together  the world can turn the tide against HIV/AIDS  once and for all.  Malaria is another common killer. In some countries  malaria takes as many lives as HIV/AIDS  the vast majority of them children under the age of five. Every one of these deaths is unnecessary  because the disease is preventable and treatable. The world knows what it takes to stop malaria   bed nets  indoor spraying and medicine to treat the disease. Two years ago  America launched a $1.2 billion malaria initiative. Other nations and the private sector are making vital contributions as well. I call on every Member State to maintain its focus  to find new ways to join this cause and to bring us closer to the day when deaths caused by malaria are no more.  Thirdly  the mission of the United Nations requires liberating people from the chains of illiteracy and ignorance. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration states that everyone has the right to education. When nations make the investments needed to educate their people  the whole world benefits. Better education unleashes the talent and potential of citizens and adds to the prosperity of all of us. Better education promotes better health and greater independence. Better education increases the strength of democracy and weakens the appeal of violent ideologies. So the United States is joining with nations around the world to help them provide a better education for their people.  A good education starts with good teachers. In partnership with other nations  America has helped train more than 600 000 teachers and administrators. A good education requires good textbooks. So  in partnership with other nations  America has distributed tens of millions of textbooks. A good education requires access to good schools. So  in partnership with other nations  America is helping nations raise standards in their schools at home and providing scholarships to help students come to schools in the United States. And in all our education efforts  our nation is working to expand access for women and girls so that the opportunity to get a decent education is open to all.  Finally  the mission of the United Nations requires liberating people from poverty and despair. Article 23 of the Universal Declaration states that everyone has the right to work  to free choice of employment and to just and favourable conditions of work. In the twenty-first century  this requires ensuring that people in poor countries have the same opportunity to benefit from the global economy that citizens of wealthy countries have.  The United Nations provides vital economic assistance designed to help developing nations grow their economies and reach their potential. The United States agrees with that position. We have dramatically increased our own development assistance  and we are delivering that aid in innovative ways. We started the Millennium Challenge Account to reward nations that govern justly  fight corruption  invest in their people and promote economic freedom. With this aid  we are reaching out to developing nations in partnership  not paternalism. And we are ensuring that our aid dollars reach those who need them and achieve results.  In the long run  the best way to lift people out of poverty is through trade and investment. A nation that is open and trading with the world will create economic rewards that far exceed anything it could get through foreign aid. During the 1990s  developing nations that significantly lowered tariffs saw their per capita income grow about three times faster than other developing countries. Open markets ignite growth  encourage investment  increase transparency  strengthen the rule of law and help countries help themselves.  The international community now has a historic chance to open markets around the world by concluding a successful Doha Round of trade talks. A successful Doha outcome would mean real and substantial openings in agriculture  goods and services  and real and substantial reductions in trade-distorting subsidies. The world’s largest trading nations  including major developing countries  have a special responsibility to make the tough political decisions to reduce trade barriers. America has the wi11 and flexibility to make those necessary decisions. Our negotiators are demonstrating that spirit in Geneva. I urge other leaders to direct their negotiators to do the same. And I am optimistic that we can reach a good Doha agreement and seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity.  In the meantime  America wi11 continue to pursue agreements that open trade and investment wherever we can. We recently signed free-trade agreements with Peru  Colombia  Panama and South Korea. These agreements embody the values of open markets  transparent and fair regulation  respect for private property and resolving disputes under rules of international law. These are good agreements. They are now ready for a congressional vote  and I urge our Congress to approve them as soon as possible.  As America works with the United Nations to alleviate immediate needs  we are also coming together to address longer-term challenges. Together  we are preparing for pandemics that could cause death and suffering on a global scale. Together  we are working to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Together  we are confronting the challenges of energy security  environmental quality and climate change. I appreciate the discussions on climate change led by the Secretary-General last night. I look forward to further discussions at the meeting of major economies in Washington later this week.  The goals I have outlined today cannot be achieved overnight  and they cannot be achieved without reform of this vital institution. The United States is committed to a strong and vibrant United Nations. Yet the American people are disappointed by the failures of the Human Rights Council. That body has been silent on repression by regimes from Havana and Caracas to Pyongyang and Tehran  while focusing its criticism excessively on Israel. To be credible on human rights in the world  the United Nations must first reform its own Human Rights Council.  Some have also called for reform of the structure of the Security Council  including an expansion of its membership. The United States is open to this prospect. We believe that Japan is well qualified for permanent membership on the Security Council and that other nations should be considered as well. The United States will listen to all good ideas  and we will support changes to the Security Council as part of broader United Nations reform. And in all we do  I call on Member States to work for an institution that adheres to strict ethical standards and lives up to the high principles of the Universal Declaration.  With the commitment and courage of those in this Hall  we can build a world where people are free to speak  assemble and worship as they wish   a world where children in every nation grow up healthy  get a decent education and look to the future with hope   a world where opportunity crosses every border. America will lead towards that vision  in which all are created equal and free to pursue their dreams. That is the founding conviction of my country. It is the promise that established this body. And  with our determination  it can be the future of our world.  "
"180",7281,"UZB",62,2007,"Allow me  on behalf of the Republic of Uzbekistan  to welcome the participants in the General Assembly at its sixty-second session and wish this forum success in its work.  I am not mistaken if I say that the world community is looking forward to concrete results from the realization of the development goals formulated in the Millennium Declaration. A special role has been assigned to the United Nations in achieving the objectives set by the Declaration  including elaborating fair and acceptable approaches to the issues of the access to  and use and distribution of  natural resources; maintaining environmental sustainability; combating transnational threats; and establishing a free  tolerant and stable developing world in the context of globalization.  One of the most serious problems of the present day is the reasonable use of natural resources and  above all  water and energy resources. Various and ambiguous approaches in this sphere hamper the process of development and lead to conflict situations and sometimes to ecological catastrophes. The fate of the Aral Sea may serve as an example. The receding of the Sea has tragic consequences not only for the peoples of Central Asia but also for the larger subregion and even all of Eurasia.  It is necessary to underscore that the major point is the use of resources and watercourses of transboundary rivers  which over the span of centuries have met the vital needs of States and peoples living along these rivers. The Republic of Uzbekistan believes that all decisions on the use of the watercourses of transboundary rivers  including the construction of hydropower facilities  must in no way inflict ecological damage or infringe upon the interests of the population of countries in the neighbouring territories.  The Convention on the Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context of February 1991  the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes of March 1992  and the Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses of 1997 directly point to the reasonable use of transboundary river resources. Those Conventions require that transboundary waters be used in a reasonable and equitable way  taking into particular account their transboundary character  in the case of activities that have or are likely to have a transboundary impact.  In the case of the infliction of damage  all measures must be taken to repair or mitigate such damage  and  if necessary  the issue of compensation is to be considered. It is underscored in United Nations Conventions that the watercourse States shall cooperate on the basis of sovereign equality  territorial integrity  mutual benefit and good faith. According to those fundamental requirements of the Conventions  authoritative international experts must give guarantees that the construction of hydrotechnical facilities will not have irremediable ecological consequences and will not throw off the established balance of the use of watercourses of transboundary rivers by all States located in the basin of those rivers.  We are convinced that those requirements must be fulfilled in the implementation of various projects building hydropower facilities in Central Asia with the participation of both national and transnational companies  so as not to allow for a catastrophic deterioration of the ecological situation in the region. We would like to remind investor countries who have expressed a wish to participate in the implementation of such projects of those conditions.  The current situation in Central Asia demonstrates the interlinking of many contradictory processes  which could negatively influence security not only in our region  but also far beyond its limits. Uzbekistan has consistently supported the effective post-war recovery of Afghanistan. We strongly believe that stabilizing the situation in Afghanistan should be accomplished not through militarization  but through demilitarization  the resolution of outstanding social and economic problems and support to the country’s population through the active participation and assistance of the world community. Certainly  the most important conditions for that are the reaching of a consensus  the taking of coordinated measures by all parties interested in stabilizing and reviving Afghanistan and curbing the ever-present drug threat that emanates from that country.  The matter of shaping and promoting an ideology of tolerance  mutual understanding and cultural diversity has taken on a special urgency in the context of maintaining peace and security at the regional and global levels. The Republic of Uzbekistan makes its own contribution to the support of the dialogue among cultures and civilizations  which must be maintained in the framework of international law without strain or pressure  without attempts to impose unacceptable values and moral norms and by preserving respect for peoples  thought processes which have been shaped over many centuries and millennia. The correctness of such an approach was particularly stressed during the international conference on Uzbekistan’s contribution to the development of Islamic civilization  held in Uzbekistan in August 2007  and attended by prominent scholars  theologians and government and public figures from different parts of the world.  The designation by the Islamic Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization of Tashkent  the capital of Uzbekistan  as a world capital of Islamic culture represented the recognition of the role and significance of Uzbekistan in Islamic civilization. Uzbekistan has for centuries been a centre of enlightened Islam  which seeks to strengthen in the consciousness of people such eternal values as the aspiration towards kindness and peace  tolerance in inter-ethnic and inter-faith relations  and mutual respect and accord among peoples  regardless of the colour of their skin or their beliefs. That is why we are seriously concerned about some negative interpretations of the historical role of Islam and the deliberate distortion of historical facts. We resolutely oppose the transformation of counterterrorism into Islamophobia and into an overt or covert stand-off with the Islamic world.  In such circumstances  the role of the United Nations is more important than ever before in encouraging and promoting cultural diversity  tolerance and mutual understanding among religions. In that context  Uzbekistan welcomes the High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace to be held on 4 and 5 October.  In conclusion  I wish to express the sincere hope that the results of the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session will promote the successful realization of the joint efforts of Member States to address challenges and threats to global security  as well as the further peaceful development of the world’s nations. "
"181",7293,"VAT",62,2007,"Mr. President  the Holy See takes this opportunity to congratulate you on your election and looks forward to working with you. At the same time  it is my pleasure to greet the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and wish him well at his first full session of the General Assembly.  Less than a year ago  the General Assembly approved the project to renovate these United Nations Headquarters. Such material renovation seems an appropriate reminder for States of the need to be constantly renewed in the pursuit of the great objectives that inspired the creation of the Organization of the United Nations.   Sixty-two years ago  the United Nations was established in order to save future generations from the scourge of war  to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and value of the human person  to ensure respect for international law and to promote social progress in universal freedom. Today  once more  we must reaffirm those values in order to deliver a forceful “no” to war and an equally forceful “yes” to human dignity.  The Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations  in its reference to the fundamental rights and the dignity of the human person  uses the word “faith” and links it to dialogue and cooperation among nations. In this way it is affirmed that there is such a thing as universal and transcendent truth about man and his innate dignity  which is not only prior to all political activity but determines it  so that no ideology of power can eliminate it.  This innate dignity also determines the just measure of national interests  which may never be considered absolute  and in defence of which not only is it never right to harm the legitimate interests of other States  but there is an obligation at the same time to help promote the common good of all people. Respect for human dignity  therefore  is the deepest ethical foundation in the search for peace and in the building up of international relations corresponding to the authentic needs and hopes of all the peoples of the Earth. To forget or to accept partially and selectively that principle is what lies at the origin of conflict  environmental degradation and social and economic injustice.  The terrorist attacks that marked the beginning of the twenty-first century have given rise to pessimistic visions of humanity based on a supposed clash of civilizations. At times  people respond by returning to extreme forms of nationalism  or by extending justification for the use of force  or by further relativizing values essentially tied to human dignity  in particular the universal right to life and to religious freedom.  Nowadays  the binomial “culture and religion” is increasingly heard in this Hall. The Holy See welcomes the initiative to hold a High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace  which will take place here on  5 October under the leadership of the General Assembly President. Indeed  dialogue among peoples of different cultures and religions is not an option; it is something that is indispensable for peace and for the renewal of international life.  The Holy See hopes that the increased interest on the part of non-religious bodies and institutions will contribute to a greater respect for religious freedom everywhere. Today  the right to religious freedom continues to be disregarded  and even violated  in certain places. Such violations have become a pretext for various other forms of discrimination. If religious leaders and believers expect States and societies to respect them and acknowledge their religions to be true instruments of peace  they themselves must respect religious freedom; they must show that they pledge to promote peace and shun violence; they must demonstrate that religion is not and must not become a pretext for conflict; and they must declare without ambiguity that to promote violence or to wage war in the name of religion is a blatant contradiction.  At the difficult crossroads at which humanity finds itself today  the use of force no longer represents a sustainable solution. It is important to help the Conference on Disarmament find a way out of the impasse in which it has been languishing for more than a decade  to relieve the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons from the severe strain to which it has been increasingly subjected lately  and to give new impetus to recognizing the value of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. This year’s fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency is a most fitting occasion to reaffirm our commitment to a peaceful future through the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  the reduction and definitive dismantling of existing nuclear weapons and the non-discriminatory  peaceful and safe use of nuclear technology.  Moreover  this Organization must take further steps on arms control in the field of conventional weapons  including small arms and light weapons. The Holy See associates itself with all appeals that underline the importance of adopting a common approach aimed at combating not only illegal traffic in such weapons but also other connected activities  such as terrorism  organized crime and trafficking in drugs and in precious raw materials.  Another important area in which the Holy See urges serious and effective action on the part of the international community is that of cluster munitions. A rapid response to this problem is becoming an ethical imperative because of the high cost in human life  the majority of the victims being civilians  especially children.  This Organization has expressed its willingness many times to devote more resources to conflict prevention  particularly in the area of mediation. In this regard  the Holy See has a particular interest in the efforts of the Department of Political Affairs to create a standing team of expert mediators as part of the Secretary-General’s goal to make more effective use of his good offices for conflict prevention. While the multiplication of peace operations could mean that there has been a failure to prevent conflict situations from erupting into full-scale armed conflicts  it is also a sign of the trust that the international community places in the mechanisms of the United Nations and in their cooperation with regional agencies. In this context  we look forward to the day that peacekeeping efforts in Darfur will finally be fully operational.  I wish to recall the contribution of the United Nations towards a just and final solution to the conflicts that for too long have caused bloodshed in the Middle East. There is need for renewed commitment on the part of all Member countries in the pacification and reconstruction of long-suffering Iraq  a reconstruction that is more moral and political than economic. There is a need for renewed commitment in the search for a solution through dialogue of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians  one which is capable of recognizing the legitimate expectations of each side.   Renewed commitment is needed in ensuring that Lebanon will continue to be a free and independent country  a democratic  multicultural and multi-confessional society  equitable and respectful of all people and of the various trends present in its midst  like a common home open to others. This is particularly necessary in the present crucial period leading to an election of the new head of State.  Finally  I cannot but make reference to what is happening in Myanmar  which these days occupies the attention and concerns of the General Assembly and of the whole international community. I wish to reiterate the appeal made yesterday by Pope Benedict XVI: through dialogue  good will and a spirit of humanity  may a solution to the crisis be found quickly for the good of the country and a better future for all its inhabitants.  The creation two years ago of the Peacebuilding Commission was based upon the conviction that it is not enough to put an end to wars  but it is also necessary to help reconstruct individual lives and the social and institutional fabric. Now  the biggest test for the international community is to give the Peacebuilding Commission the mandate and the means to prove on the ground that it can successfully manage and support the difficult transition from war and misery to peace and development.  Many of the problems that are attributed today almost exclusively to cultural and religious differences have their origin in economic and social injustice. Freedom from want  illness  hunger and ignorance is a necessary precondition for a serene dialogue of civilizations. Forty years ago  in his encyclical Populorum Progressio  Pope Paul VI stated that development is the new name for peace. The Holy See is concerned about the inability of rich countries to offer the poorest countries  especially those in Africa  financial and trade conditions capable of promoting their sustainable development.  I salute the high-level event on climate change held here on 24 September. The Holy See wishes to underline once again the moral imperative incumbent upon each and every one of us in safeguarding the environment   our fundamental common good.  We are approaching the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  yet many have never heard of it or been given the benefits of its principles. Those rights are not based on the mere will of human beings  or in the reality of the State or in public powers  but rather are grounded in the objective requirements of the nature bestowed on man.  The most important part of our work in that context is to ensure that the right to life is respected everywhere. That fundamental right must be protected from conception until natural death. Therefore  we must work to stop and reverse the culture of death embraced by some social and legal structures that try to make the suppression of life acceptable by disguising it as a medical or social service. In that sense  the abolition of the death penalty should also be seen as a consequence of full respect for the right to life.  The legitimate quest for equality between men and women has achieved positive results. Nevertheless  inequalities in the exercise of basic human rights unfortunately still persist in many places. That leads to a breakdown in the social fabric and results in women’s objectification and exploitation. The vindication of equality needs to be accompanied by the awareness that it goes hand in hand with and does not endanger  much less contradict  the recognition of both the difference and the complementarity between men and women.  The Holy See looks forward to the commemorative high-level meeting on the follow-up to the outcome of the special session on children  scheduled for 11 and 12 December 2007. It will be an  opportunity to refocus our commitments to children and to redouble our efforts to promote their rights  end violence against them and support the family.  Faith in human dignity demands that the problem of migration be approached in the context of human rights  family rights and children’s rights. While it is essential to fight human trafficking and legitimate to curb illegal migration  no one can justify measures which put lives at risk or gravely offend human dignity and human rights. The Holy See welcomes the momentum created by the first meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development  held in Brussels in July  and looks forward to more progress in that regard.  We must continue to ensure that peace and security and development and human rights are effectively combined and mutually reinforcing  in order to show the international community that the renovation of United Nations Headquarters is not only physical  but also a renewal of the Organization’s ideals and intentions. A renewal that reaches into the deepest corners of the Organization is one in which all nations of the world will rightly take pride. "
"182",7328,"VCT",62,2007,"It is with a profound sense of anticipation that I welcome Mr. Kerim’s assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. In accepting the presidency  he succinctly outlined an exciting raison d’être for a modern  active and engaged United Nations  namely  a focus on multilateral cooperation to combat the challenges of globalization  climate change  terrorism  immigration and sustainable development. I have every confidence that  under his enlightened presidency  the General Assembly will fashion positive  tangible and creative solutions to those global challenges.  Our recent history has taught us that triumphalist  imperialist unilateralism is a consistent cause  but an infrequent solution  to the problems confronting today’s world. But it is at this moment  as the philosophy of unilateralist misadventure is in its death throes  that a modern  multilateral United Nations must seize the day  fill the vacuum and live up to the noble and immutable principles of its Charter. That modern and multilateral United Nations  under Mr. Kerim’s presidency  should never sacrifice principle for an ignoble practicality  but should instead be suffused with a fairness that views the world through the eyes not of imperial tsars  indifferent diplomats or apathetic agencies   to whom suffering is but a television event easily erased with the flick of a remote-control button   but through the eyes of the vast majority of the world’s citizens  who struggle daily for survival  who dodge bullets in their backyards  who coax a meagre living from parched and exhausted soils and who have been globalized to the brink of extinction. It is not idealistic or naive to assert that engaged  fair and genuinely concerned States working together can solve the seemingly intractable problems besetting our imperfect planet. Our problems are largely man-made; so too are the solutions. The recent focus by the United Nations on the issue of climate change and global warming is a welcome development. It is the prayer of humankind that this belated momentum has not come too late to reverse the damage already inflicted on our planet. After all  we are short-term caretakers of the Earth  and it is our sacred duty to preserve it for future generations. This is a great cause of our time  and we must not be timid or doubtful in the face of any great cause.  I would like to remind the General Assembly that  15 years ago  the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change recognized that global warming would have a special impact on small States  countries with low-lying coastal areas and countries with areas prone to natural disasters. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  for example  the overwhelming majority of our hard-won infrastructural developments  by way of geographic necessity  lie mere inches above sea level and perilously close to the coastline. Through absolutely no fault of our own  the physical manifestations of our emerging post-colonial State can be obliterated by inexorably rising sea levels.   The Caribbean’s vital banana industry  already buffeted by the winds of iniquitous globalization  has been repeatedly devastated in recent years by increasingly intense hurricanes  which have placed a hitherto dominant economic sector on veritable life support. In any event  the environmental damage caused in producing quality bananas for the European Community over the recent decades is ignored by those whose consumerist demands engender further environmental damage.  The solutions to the problem of climate change are multifaceted  but an indispensable component must be the adoption by the States parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of the climate change Adaptation Fund for environmentally challenged African  Asian  Caribbean  Latin American and Pacific States. The Fund would put flesh on the skeletal commitments of the Convention on Climate Change  which compelled developed countries to provide additional financial resources to assist developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of global warming. The Fund should be a source both of disaster relief and of the technological and infrastructural support needed to adapt to climate change.   The developed States Members of the United Nations can no longer afford to view the increasingly frequent and intense natural disasters as individual events  capable of narrow prescriptive solutions and subject to the vagaries of donor fatigue. They must live up to their obligations  both legal and moral  to assist the developing world in dealing with challenges that were born in the smoke-belching factories and car-clogged highways of the polluters.  The quest for energy self-sufficiency and environmentally friendly energy consumption has led to a rush towards the production of ethanol in some countries. This  however  requires careful thought and sensible implementation. For example  the use of corn to produce ethanol is driving up the price worldwide of grain  beef  chicken and milk. The poor will suffer unless a prudently balanced approach is adopted. The United Nations has a vital role to play in that regard.  As a proud citizen of the Republic of Macedonia  the President is all too familiar with the terrors wrought by wars born of ethnic conflict. It is my earnest prayer that his personal experience will lend urgency to what has been the seemingly heartless neglect on the part of the United Nations  in practical terms  of the genocidal campaign being waged in Darfur. While recent developments   including the Security Council resolution 1769 (2007)  authorizing the establishment of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur  and the recent appointments of Rodolphe Adada as the Joint African Union-United Nations Special Representative for Darfur and General Martin Luther Agwai as Force Commander   are somewhat encouraging  let us not delude ourselves: the force on the ground is still insufficient  its mandate is ambiguous and its emerging presence is years too late. For too long we have looked the other way. We in the United Nations have caused the world to wonder about the relative worth of a Sudanese or Rwandan life versus an Israeli  Chinese  American or European life. What is happening in Darfur is genocide. Let us call it what it is. The United Nations must remain committed to alleviating the suffering of the men  women and children of Darfur.  In the same vein  the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines stand unequivocally with the people of Myanmar in their current struggle for democracy and life without tyranny.  The drama of war  the fight against global terrorism  insecurity and poverty  the struggle for reparation for the descendants of African slaves in the New World and the insidious impacts of climate change must continue to hold the collective attention of the General Assembly. But there are other eminently avoidable ills afflicting the developing world that also demand our focus. The Caribbean faces the worst epidemic of chronic non-communicable disease in the Americas. In 2004  the six leading causes of death in the Caribbean were heart disease  cancer  diabetes  stroke  injuries and hypertensive disease   each of which claimed more lives in the region than HIV/AIDS.  That looming health crisis  although largely self-inflicted  has an obvious global component. Globalization has spawned a creeping cultural hegemony and homogeneity with a distinct mass-consumption bias. Our home-grown Caribbean culture and our Caribbean civilization are being challenged and undermined by a shallow consumer ethic driven by multinational corporations whose sole interest is to create a standardized population of global purchasers. The explosion in media and information technology  for all its obvious benefits  has been an all-too-willing handmaiden to that cultural invasion. The homogenized  vapid and consumerist culture of the multinationals’ empire is exported worldwide  beamed directly to our computers  televisions  newspapers and cinema screens. It is devoid of context  yet rich in subtext. Its message  in a nutshell  is simple: our culture  our civilization  is better than yours. It is a subliminal message that too many of our people have unfortunately been accepting at a faster rate than the ability of our health care systems to adapt. Colonialist  imperialist  mindless and homogenizing globalization has wrought havoc. Its deleterious contemporary manifestations must be resolutely resisted.   The acceptance of a core of universal human values does not mean a submission to the consumerism of any empire. A quest by some to establish a global hegemony in everything will never be able to erase or subjugate the legitimacy of the particularity of civilizations  including our Caribbean civilization. In that context  the call for an alliance of civilizations has our support. It is likely to be more uplifting and enduring than a quest for dominance by one over the other.  The erosion of trade preferences at the multilateral level has brought with it new challenges to the small and vulnerable economies of the Caribbean  requiring Governments to engage in structural adjustments and fiscal calisthenics to keep our economies afloat. At the same time  the development deliverables that the Doha Round promised to our countries   which  like the Biblical manna  are urgently needed for our sustenance   have yet to materialize  owing to the floundering negotiations of that Round. Let us recall that the first and last of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) speak  respectively  to the eradication of poverty and to global partnership for development. But for small and vulnerable economies the attainment of those two goals will be significantly compromised if the multilateral trade rules and provisions are not sufficiently accommodating to the special needs of countries like ours.  Special and differential treatment for developing countries is vital to offset the potential losses that are occasioned by globalization and the liberalization of markets. That is why aid-for-trade and a mobilization of resources must be on the agenda of multilateral organizations  to be used as an instrument for economic growth and capacity-building in developing countries. The recent launch of the MDG call to action by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is an initiative that my Government supports  and it may well act as a much-needed spur to get us back on track to achieving the MDGs by the target date of 2015.  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines yet again pleads with the United Nations to permit Taiwan to be accorded its rightful admission to the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Taiwan  a democratic and progressive country of 23 million people  remains a legitimate and vibrant political expression of the ancient and magnificent Chinese civilization. There is no adequate justification for the continued exclusion of Taiwan from participation in the numerous global exchanges in the United Nations and other international bodies. We urge Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to accept and deal with Taiwan’s membership application in accordance with the Charter. Taiwan possesses all the attributes and qualifications for membership of the United Nations. Let it therefore be done. Furthermore  the United Nations must play its role in reducing tensions across the Taiwan Strait.  Aggressive conduct must be restrained in a context where Taiwan is committed to peace and a comprehensive political dialogue.  I shall conclude as the Assembly President began  by urging swift and effective multilateral action to tackle the challenges of the modern world. As the Cuban poet and national hero José Martí once said  “It is a sin not to do what one is capable of doing”. By that measure  the sins of omission and commission of the United Nations are manifold and manifest  despite its successes. Our collective multilateral and principled penance must be measured even more by our actions from this day onward. We must therefore now act together on each of the world’s enduring challenges. Each nation and each person has a vital role to play. An arrogance born of triumphalism that seeks to exclude so many who look askance at an imperial agenda must cease. The master poet from Martinique  Aime Cesaire  addresses this issue well in his famous Cahier d’un retour au pays natal:   No race has a monopoly on beauty  on intelligence  on strength ... There is room for everyone at the convocation of conquests ... We know now that the sun turns around our Earth  lighting the parcel designated by our will alone ... [and that] every star falls from sky to Earth at our omnipotent command. "
"183",7375,"VEN",62,2007,"Our people  from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  have followed last week’s debate of General Assembly. They are a people in the middle of a revolution that has succeeded in building new spaces for a political culture; a people that is informed and educated  that has followed closely the positions put forward at this Assembly. We could say that the debate has reflected the current situation in the world  a world that is struggling to build itself in peace  a world that is seeking new directions.  A year ago  the President Hugo Chávez Frías spoke from this podium to warn the world  to confirm the alert of many in the world on the madness  the warmongering madness that has been imposed alongside the desire for peace  a desire of the majority of the world.   Today  we can take stock of this warmongering madness. Six years ago  through a lie  invasion and aggression were sold to a brotherly people  the people of Iraq. It was built on the basis of a global campaign  a justification for the military occupation of the Arab people of Iraq  of the Iraqi nation.  Today  five years later  we can see the result of a policy filled with hate and evil. From 2002 to 2006 of the United States budget  $610 billion have been invested in maintaining the war in the Middle East   $610 billion to bring about death and destruction  $610 billion that were taken from American taxpayers in order to invest in bullets  bombs and death. That $610 billion invested in war  if it had been invested during the past six years that the Iraqi occupation has lasted  today could have meant social progress  equality and justice for the people of Iraq.  But the results are obvious  and clearly visible. Research by the world’s universities states that more than 600 000 Iraqis have died as a result of the invasion and military occupation. More than the 3 600 young American were sent to their deaths. More than 25 000 young Americans have now returned to their country crippled  blind  deaf or disabled for life. The $610 billion invested in death has only multiplied the violence  and the result that we see today is that the invasion has not led to a safer or more balanced world. The result has not been a world at peace. Today  the nations of the world must acknowledge that we have a world that is less safe  with greater dangers because of terrorism. We have an unbalanced Middle East  filled with violence and divisions.   If that $610 billion invested in war and death in Iraq had been invested in life  we would be looking at a different situation today. With $610 billion  we could build 3 million clinics to provide health services to the world  as is done today by the people of Cuba and Venezuela through the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas for people throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. With the $610 billion invested in war  we could build more than 12 million decent homes for needy men and women of the three neediest latitudes of the world: Africa  Asia  and Latin America and the Caribbean. With that $610 billion invested in bullets and bombs for the purpose of killing  we could have built more than 300 000 schools that would have received at least 350 million children and young students around the world.   But no  madness and greediness for the natural resources of the world lead the elites of the United States to undertake an absurd and irrational war and to bring violence and death to the world. Today  if we took stock of the situation  of the direct results of this senseless and irrational war  we would have to say that this war has led to death  destruction and destabilization and has created even more sources of terrorism than it has been able to heal. That is why this senseless war is the worst example of how the security system has functioned to protect balance and peace in the world.  Today  the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela calls upon our brothers in the world to think. We must adjust the mechanisms to find balance and peace and to stop the madness of war.   We have seen how in recent days there has been an increase in the international media campaign to demonize the people and Government of Iran. We have seen how dangerously successive threatening statements have been made against the peace of the people of Iran. Has the world  or have the Governments represented in this General Assembly  wondered what would happen if the insatiable madness of the elite who govern the United States were to lead to a dreadful attack on the peaceful people of Iran? Where would such a situation lead us? It is time to stop that campaign of demonization  to issue warnings  to build restraining walls  to call for an end to  and make alliances to stop  the belligerent madness of the elite who govern the United States of America.   Today  the war and the struggle against terrorism occupy a very prominent place in the international public agenda. From this podium  we would like to reiterate to the Government of the United States of America the legal request for the terrorist Luis Posada Carriles to be extradited  in accordance with international law  and to be prosecuted for the crimes he committed in Latin America and the Caribbean against our peoples. Does this Assembly know that one of the most dangerous terrorists  Luis Posada Carriles   the head of a terrorist gang  who has been convicted of and confessed to crimes committed in South America during Operation Condor  who was responsible for the disappearance of hundreds of men and women  who has been convicted of and confessed to having blown up a Cubana Airlines plane in Barbados in 1976 and who placed bombs in tourist spots in Cuba in the 1990s   is now free in Florida and protected by the Government of United States of America? Does this Assembly know that this terrorist provided his services to the Central Intelligence Agency for 40 years?   We have asked the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council to examine that matter with all due diligence  and we are asking for the support of friendly Governments around the world for this terrorist to be extradited and prosecuted for having blown up a Cubana Airlines plane in Venezuela. This two-faced behaviour shows the hypocrisy of a policy that fuels war supposedly to combat terrorism but that  on its own territory  protects one of the most dangerous terrorists that the western hemisphere has ever known.   Likewise  we wish to express from this podium our solidarity with the growing call by Governments and peoples of the world for a fair judgement and the immediate release of the five Cubans imprisoned in the jails of the empire as part of the war on terror being carried out on United States territory. This demand that we are making before the General Assembly today is part of the flags of struggle that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is raising today.  From this podium today  we would like to welcome the victory of President Rafael Correa  of the progressive forces and of the people of Ecuador in the recent elections to designate the Constituent National Assembly  which will direct the peaceful process of change in Ecuador. This victory in Ecuador is part of a group of processes of change that have peacefully and democratically paved the way in South America  Latin America and the Caribbean  processes of change that they tried to stop through campaigns by national oligarchies  through international conspiracies and through media campaigns. But the voice of the people of Ecuador is clear. They have joined the voices of the people of Bolivia  Venezuela and Uruguay. South America  Latin America and the Caribbean ask  we demand that the right to peaceful democratic change in our societies be respected. We demand that the right to build  through democratic revolution  new processes and new economic and social structures be respected  making it possible to overcome poverty and to build democracies that are truly established by equality.  The world knows that there has been an ongoing conspiracy against the Venezuelan democracy and President Hugo Chávez. The world knows that in 2002 our people defeated an attempted coup d’état that sought the destruction of democracy and the assassination of President Chávez.   Today  the people of Venezuela are in the midst of a thorough reform of the Constitution. In December  the people of Venezuela  following a debate on terms and proposals related to constitutional reform  will go to the polls to decide in a sovereign manner what our country’s future should be and what reforms we should undertake to expand the foundations of political  social and economic democracy. Today  we reaffirm to the world that we want respect for Venezuela’s sovereignty and independence and an end to imperialist-led media campaigns that try to distort the real conditions of democracy building by our people and by our popular revolution.   Today  we reaffirm the need for deep-seated and comprehensive reform of the United Nations. A new  multipolar world of equilibrium  without imperialistic hegemony  is necessary  urgent and possible. We have joined the debate on United Nations reform. We believe that the Organization must be reworked. We believe that the Organization must rebuild itself so that it can faithfully serve a multipolar world  a world of equilibrium  a world of peace  a world without hegemony. Seventeen years of a unipolar world has shown us the need for a deep-seated transformation of multilateral organizations so that they can be placed at the service of peace  equality  justice and the great causes of humanity.   Today  we reaffirm our conviction that the Organization must be thoroughly reworked and must move forward by democratizing the Security Council  expanding both its permanent and its non-permanent membership; by establishing new functions for the General Assembly; and by strengthening the political role of the Secretary-General.  Finally  let us move forward with new mechanisms for dialogue  coexistence and the building of a multipolar world where we can all be equal   a world where our peoples can see themselves as equal partners in a global cooperative undertaking to build the foundations of peace and justice  to overcome the insanity of war and to be able to thwart the desire of the world’s elites to take control of the natural resources and wealth of our people.  The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reaffirms its will to move forward together with the peoples of the world in a thorough reform that will transform the United Nations into a new Organization   a genuine instrument for peace  life and development.

"184",7414,"VNM",62,2007,"Mr. President  at the outset  permit me to extend to you my warmest congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I believe that with your immense competence  you will lead this session to a successful conclusion. I highly commend Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his important contributions as the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I respectfully convey to all delegates and  through them  to the people of all Member countries  the greetings of friendship from the Vietnamese people.  When humankind entered the new millennium  we all wished for a more peaceful world  more friendly international relations and a better life. Nearly a decade has elapsed  but that wish has not come true. We are still living in a world blessed with numerous opportunities and at the same time beset with adversities and challenges. It is a blessing that since the establishment of the United Nations  humankind has not experienced any more world wars. However  local wars and conflicts  international terrorism and the continuing arms race  including the nuclear arms race  remain daunting threats to our world today.  Thanks to the miraculous scientific and technological achievements  human living conditions have improved continuously. However  there remains a bitter reality that the gap in living standards between nations and population groups is increasing. Nearly 1 billion people are still living in extreme poverty. At the same time  many pressing global issues have emerged  of which epidemics  environmental pollution and climate change have proved to be serious threats to human life.   We note with satisfaction the rapid proliferation of regional and global cooperation arrangements. In the meantime  the world is yet to be free from tense confrontation  acts of unilateral imposition  violations of national independence and sovereignty  inequality and unfair treatment in international relations.  All these require that together we make greater efforts to maintain peace and stability in all parts of the world  promote equal cooperative relations between and among States  and ensure an international environment conducive to the development of each and every nation.  In the face of enormous challenges in the new millennium  peoples of the world had high expectations of the United Nations and  in that connection  Viet Nam fully associates itself with the orientations charted by the United Nations summits in 2000 and 2005 for the work of the Organization in consolidating peace  security  cooperation and development.  We hope that the United Nations will  together with Member States  intensify efforts to establish long-lasting peace in the Middle East - including efforts aimed at an appropriate solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict  - put an end to conflicts and violence in a number of African countries  restore stability in Iraq and Afghanistan and control and prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Viet Nam supports the settlement of the Korean Peninsula issues through dialogue  in conformity with international law  and shares the Korean people’s desire for peaceful reunification.  The United Nations Millennium Declaration of 2000 and its policy of promoting sustainable development and ensuring the harmonious combination of economic growth with social equity and environmental protection have elicited practical responses from Member States. Viet Nam hopes that the United Nations will play a more active role in that process in order to create further opportunities for underdeveloped countries to escape poverty and advance with the mainstream countries of the world. In that light  Viet Nam hopes that the Doha Round will be concluded soon to facilitate a fair international trading system.  Viet Nam strongly supports development cooperation between countries and the establishment of equal international relations in economic  financial and trade areas with special attention paid to the needs of developing and least developed countries  including the removal of imposed economic blockades and embargoes. We hope that the United Nations will have more resources for development cooperation  with priority given to the implementation of programmes of action on poverty reduction  advancement of women  child care  population planning and HIV/AIDS prevention. Viet Nam strongly supports common efforts  especially the efforts of the United Nations  to protect the environment and to better respond to climate change.  For the United Nations to fulfil its noble mandate in a vastly changed world  the question of United Nations reform has been raised and keenly discussed. Viet Nam holds that the process of reform should be intensified and goes along with the common understanding that the reforms should ensure the broad participation of all Member States and should be carried out in a transparent manner. Reform should also build upon past experience and  at the same  have a comprehensive forward-looking vision.  In 1945  the United Nations was founded  right at a time when the Vietnamese people had just gained their independence. Stemming from the belief in the purposes and principles of the United Nations and the desire to contribute to the work of that new international organization  as early as in January 1946  President Ho Chi Minh  the founder of the new Vietnamese State  wrote to the first session of the United Nations General Assembly  stating clearly  “Our nation has gained independence and earnestly requests that you recognize our independence and admit our nation into the United Nations”.  Regrettably  it was not until 1977 that Viet Nam became a full Member of the United Nations. Over the past 30 years in its capacity as a United Nations Member  Viet Nam has always worked actively for peace  stability  cooperation and development in the world. Viet Nam has made significant contributions to turning South-East Asia from a war-divided region of confrontation into one of peace  friendship and cooperation  which is now moving towards an Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Community based on the three pillars: political and security matters  economic matters  and cultural and social matters.  It is our consistent position to support efforts towards the peaceful settlement of conflicts  upholding national independence and state sovereignty  promoting development programmes  tackling global social issues and establishing equal international political and economic relations for mutual benefit.  Viet Nam will continue with its policy of being a friend and reliable partner to all countries  striving for peace  independence  cooperation and development. We have established diplomatic relations with 174 countries and economic and trade ties with almost all countries and territories in the world. Viet Nam is an active member of many other regional and global organizations and forums. Most recently  Viet Nam joined the World Trade Organization as its 150th member. Viet Nam has been elected to the governing positions of many United Nations bodies and is now working closely with United Nations development organizations to implement the “One United Nations” initiative in Viet Nam as a pilot country.  We highly appreciate the assistance and support extended by United Nations organizations to Viet Nam. Our significant achievements in socio-economic development have enabled Viet Nam to fulfil a number of Millennium Development Goals ahead of schedule  especially in poverty reduction. That is also attributable to the support of the international community.  We consider it important to promote South-South cooperation. Despite being a poor country  we participated actively in the tripartite cooperation arrangement between Viet Nam and a United Nations agency to support African countries in the agricultural sector. So far  that programme has produced encouraging results.  With the desire to make further contributions to the work of the international community  in 1997 Viet Nam decided to run for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2008-2009 term. I take the opportunity to sincerely thank the Asian Group for endorsing Viet Nam as the only candidate of the continent. We are also grateful to other Member States for their broad support.  Viet Nam is fully aware of the great honour and heavy responsibility of being a non-permanent member of the Security Council  a body entrusted with the primary mission of maintaining international peace and security. If elected  Viet Nam will fully adhere to the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and will do its utmost to cooperate with other members to fulfil that important task.  Viet Nam will work closely with other countries to reduce tension and to prevent and peacefully settle conflicts in different parts of the world. We will fulfil our obligations as a party to all major international conventions and treaties on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We condemn  and are also committed to the elimination of  international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and in accordance with international law.  Viet Nam welcomes and is willing to participate in mechanisms both within and outside the Security Council to increase assistance aimed at the national reconstruction and development of conflict-ridden countries. As a nation that has experienced post-war reconstruction and has accomplished important achievements on its development path  Viet Nam also wishes to share its experiences with other countries throughout the world.  Mindful of the active role played by United Nations peacekeeping operations  Viet Nam has made financial contributions to and participated in a number of United Nations activities to restore peace in various countries. We are completing the preparatory process for our effective participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations  in keeping with our circumstances and capacity.  We share the view that  if the Security Council is to work more effectively  it must be further reformed to achieve greater representativeness and greater democracy in its working methods. We also support strengthening the Council’s relationships with regional organizations. It is therefore encouraging that  at the present session  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the United Nations just signed a cooperation agreement.  I believe that  as a result of its open and constructive foreign policy and its active contributions to international peace and security and development cooperation  Viet Nam will receive full support from all Member States for its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term 2008-2009. We will do whatever we can to fulfil that important aspiration.   Viet Nam will always be an active  constructive  cooperative and responsible member of the international community  living up to the expectations of all Member States. On behalf of the Government and the people of Viet Nam  I express the sincere hope that the sixty-second session of the General Assembly will be successful  meeting the expectations of the peoples of the world in the service of peace  security  cooperation and development.

"185",7445,"VUT",62,2007,"I bring to this Assembly warm greetings from the people of Vanuatu.  Today is an important day in the histories of four of our Members of the United Nations family  and my Government and the people of Vanuatu congratulate the people of Tuvalu  Nigeria and Cyprus on their independence anniversaries  and the people of the People’s Republic of China on the anniversary of the founding of that great nation.  Let me also join others in extending our felicitations to you  Sir. You take up your high position at a time when the United Nations is confronted by some enormous challenges. The uncertainty shrouding the horizon will severely test our common resolve to address global problems.   The escalating tension and animosity in the world today are an affront to the principles and values of the Organization and ultimately challenge international order. What the world needs right now is a hand of friendship to rebuild trust and faith among and between Members. The resounding war of words must not be accepted with complacency.  As one of the smallest members of the United Nations family of nations  Vanuatu would like to reaffirm its commitment to building global peace and security. We will also continue to participate in United Nations peacekeeping missions.  May I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade some 200 years ago. My country also suffered tremendously from those horrendous acts executed by the great champions of deception and iniquity  who were responsible for enslaving thousands of men  women and children and shipping them to foreign shores under inhumane conditions using malicious torture. The days of blackbirding are long gone  but the bitter memories and injurious social consequences are entrenched in the history of my country and people. I honour all the descendants of slaves for their courage and their determination to live on. They deserve a special place in the countries in which their forefathers were forced to live. There also remains a huge debt owed to the countries that suffered large human losses from those heinous crimes against humanity. We cannot exonerate the past  but we can all hope for a just and better future. All countries must work together to prevent other insidious contemporary forms of slavery that have established themselves in our societies.  I welcome and support the decision to make climate change the theme of this session of the General Assembly. In the same vein  my Government highly commends the Secretary-General for convening last week’s high-level meeting  which should provide an important catalyst for the conference to be held later this year in Bali.  I should now like to take this opportunity to recognize and commend the work done under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to address the effects of climate change and to promote mitigation and adaptation strategies. But the point must be made that rapidly reducing the emission of greenhouse gases by all major emitters must be ensured within the next 10 to 15 years.   We followed with great interest the recent debate about the criteria and rules that the United Nations uses to decide whether a country should or should not be removed from its list of least developed countries. Graduation is desirable and fair if  and only if  it is the culmination of a process of structural progress over time   that is to say  progress based on irreversible improvements in the structure of the economy or in the basic indicators of development. It is only fair and logical  therefore  that the criteria used as a basis for identifying a country for graduation should be structural criteria.  The United Nations currently uses three criteria to identify cases for graduation. Admittedly  only two of the three are structural in nature. One relates to human capital   essentially as regards health and education   and the other to economic vulnerability. The proponents of reform of the graduation rule rightly postulate that those two criteria together should form the basis for identifying a country for graduation. The current graduation rule allows the United Nations to declare a country ready for graduation even if only one of those two paramount thresholds has been met. We consider the current practice to be conceptually flawed and fraught with serious implications. We believe this anomaly can easily be remedied.  My Government is of the view that the General Assembly should invite the Economic and Social Council to revisit the graduation rule in the light of the ongoing debate  and that the experts who advise the Council should be mandated to explore reform of the rule with a view to making human assets and economic vulnerability paramount. Such a reform would do justice to countries that have not achieved the implied structural progress. The Government of Vanuatu will do its utmost to cooperate with the relevant United Nations bodies and other like-minded nations and friends in forging consensus on this matter. I am convinced that such consensus implicitly exists  and needs only to be formalized.  Experts and members of the Committee for Development Policy should also be encouraged to undertake in-country consultations and to experience first-hand the development conditions of countries that are on the verge of graduation. We are talking about the livelihoods of peoples who may be seriously affected by decisions that are made at the United Nations.  We must continue to work together in shaping the architecture of the United Nations so that it is more resourceful and relevant to our times and to the peoples whom we represent.  I would like to commend the United Nations for increasing its presence in the Pacific region though its country-based offices. We will encourage more decentralization of functions to regional offices  which are better suited to responding to the needs of Members.   The situation in the Middle East is of grave concern to all peace-loving Members of the United Nations. We earnestly pray and hope for an early end to the conflict and to the suffering of all innocent children  women and men. Both Israel and Palestine have the right to live in peaceful coexistence as independent and sovereign States. The international community must be realistic about the future. Let us allow justice  security and long-lasting peace to prevail for both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.  My Government very much welcomes the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It is our hope that the Declaration will provide a framework for addressing the grievances of indigenous peoples  who remain suppressed  alienated and disadvantaged in the land of their forefathers. We can only hope that this instrument will provide an enabling mechanism to allow indigenous peoples the freedom to fully participate  without fear of reprisals  in the affairs and development of their countries. The Declaration should also serve to restore dignity to those who have remained second-class citizens in the land of their fathers. We cannot turn back the clock  but we can create a better future for them. The Charter of the United Nations espouses the principles that continue to guide the Organization’s efforts in the process of self-determination. The Charter calls for recognition of  and respect for  the fundamental and inalienable rights of people and territories still under colonial rule to determine their own future. We cannot champion democracy while turning a blind eye to those who have cried out for peace and freedom for many years  as have our brothers in West Papua. It is the moral responsibility of the Organization to act with diligence and to work towards promoting better conditions in larger freedom.  Finally  I would like to acknowledge the support of Vanuatu’s major development partners   in particular Australia  New Zealand  France  Japan  the People’s Republic of China  the United States of America and the European Union. I would also like to express my Government’s gratitude to India  Thailand  Malaysia  Singapore  Indonesia  Turkey and various United Nations agencies for their ongoing contributions to the development of Vanuatu.  In conclusion  the world we live in today can only become a better place if all countries   big and small  powerful and weak   recognize  understand  value and respect each other as equals. The pride of the human person is the essence of building equality between all persons. Respect also means accepting the national sovereignty of each individual country and refraining from interfering in the internal affairs of any State. If we are to work towards building a future that will provide security  peace  hope and prosperity for all future generations  those important values must be upheld at all times.  May I remind the Assembly that our personal aims should not be paramount. We must work with all the diligence and wisdom that God the Almighty has given us to serve His people.  "
"186",7477,"WSM",62,2007,"Samoa would like to  congratulate the President on his election as President of the General Assembly. We fully support the agenda that will guide our work during his tenure. In the same spirit  Samoa would like to extend its best wishes to the new Secretary-General as he leads our Organization through new and uncharted waters during these difficult times.  The High-level Event on Climate Change held earlier this week underscored two fundamental truths  namely  that climate change is solvable   with the solution firmly in our hands   and that the United Nations continues to be an indispensable institution in our search for answers to the global challenges confronting humankind. From all accounts  the  High-level Event was a considerable success; but success is measured not in the number of statements delivered  nor in the level of participation  but in the political will to translate undertakings into concrete results on the ground to usher in an effective and comprehensive post-Kyoto agreement. The time for rhetoric is over. We need to convert our good words into deeds.  Climate change  like many other global challenges  crosses borders uninvited. It has no respect for national sovereignty and does not discriminate between countries   whether rich or poor  large or small  resilient or vulnerable. Its dire consequences are real and everywhere for all to see  including those who would prefer to remain unconvinced. Climate change cannot be wished away. Even those countries that have been in denial to date must surely now accept the weight of scientific evidence and concede that climate change  facilitated largely through human-induced activities  poses one of the gravest threats to humankind and to the continuation of life in our world as we know it today.  Obviously  we have failed badly as custodians of the planet and its future. But apportioning blame for the present state of our environment is itself yet another human failing. It serves no useful purpose. Being judgmental will not restore our environment. Those who exploit the traditional divide between developed and developing countries  and ideological and political differences  do so conveniently to mask their unwillingness to be part of the solution to an impending catastrophe.  Climate change is a societal problem that requires a decisive response from the world community. It is a global challenge that should unite us. In division there is little we can do. But as a truly united world community there is a great deal that could be achieved to at least arrest  and even reverse  the threat of climate change. A timely example of what can be achieved when the political commitment to cooperate is present is the Pacific Alliance for Sustainability  an innovative approach by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for expedited access to GEF resources by Pacific island countries to meet some of the adaptation and mitigation needs associated with climate change.  The United Nations remains our last best hope to provide the political will and the necessary commitment to turn the tide against climate change. Samoa calls upon those Member States of the Organization in a position of world leadership to lead the charge in finding and implementing solutions to the causes of climate change. As present custodians of our world’s environment  we owe it to our children and to future generations to do what needs to be done quickly and decisively  before we run out of time. It is therefore imperative to complete a post-2012 climate change agreement that is effective  binding  capable of being swiftly implemented and universally owned and respected by the 192 Member States of the United Nations.  In the global work that needs to be done to address climate change  and indeed in any of the other weighty challenges facing our world  we of course look to nations in positions of leadership to lead by good example. In the all-important pillars of the United Nations   concerning economic development  human rights  peace and security   nations in leadership roles must as a matter of principle protect the interests of the weak and vulnerable. They should accord priority and give their full attention to finding solutions to issues of global concern.   In the same way that nations in leadership roles are called to account in doing the right thing for our world  so must all the Member States of the United Nations uphold their part of the bargain in the work that needs to be done. Without that cooperation from all Member States  reaching the objectives we all know should be achieved will continue to elude us. Solutions to liberate our world from the tyranny and futility of war  the social and economic inequalities that we are trapped in and the uncontrolled and wild spread of epidemic diseases have all been mapped out. They have been discussed  debated  negotiated and  in most cases  agreed to over the life of the Organization.  As with climate change  global long-term challenges that continue to remain unsolved should be approached collectively and positively within the framework of the United Nations. An integrated approach is desirable  given the interconnectedness and the mutually reinforcing nature of the issues. That calls for visionary and far-sighted leaders  statesmen and stateswomen who are not deterred from making the right decisions.  That is much to ask for in a world of unequal resource endowments  size  status and strength   where national interests take precedence over the global good and where policies are selected  not because they are the right and correct thing to do  but because of their acceptability to the voting constituents  how much they cost and who pays the bill at the end of the day. But times are changing.  The world is one global family  and no country exists in isolation. Interdependence is the norm  and none is immune from the reaches of the global problems challenging our very existence. As history has shown  no one country  however powerful and willing  can remain aloof and be able to solve all those problems on its own. The United Nations therefore remains the best means to achieve multilateral cooperation in so many important areas. With unity of purpose and mind among the membership of the United Nations  we would have every reason to be optimistic about finding solutions to the problems that beset our world.  That is why Samoa supports the efforts to strengthen and reform the United Nations and its constituent parts to make them cost-effective and efficient when responding to the needs of stakeholders. Central to the reorganization is a revitalized General Assembly as the primary policy- and  decision-making organ of the United Nations. It should also include a functioning Security Council  whose membership should be increased in both categories to mirror present day realities  including those with the capacity and the disposition to contribute to the Council’s work and its legitimacy. Moreover  we encourage the efforts under way to streamline the work of the different United Nations agencies to eliminate wastage of resources and unnecessary duplication of time and effort.  In the Pacific region  the long-promised United Nations presence in island States where the Organization is not represented has yet to materialize. That is unfortunate  given the time that has passed and the importance island leaders attach to the enhanced visibility of the United Nations to assist in forging partnerships and building capacity to help sustain the development efforts of island nations.  Samoa recently hosted the largest-ever South Pacific Games in the event’s 43-year history. The fact that Samoa was able to successfully stage that largest of the Pacific regional events notwithstanding the paucity of its resources demonstrated the importance to small island developing States of working successfully with their development partners. In the particular case of the South Pacific Games  Samoa needed to demonstrate the importance of sports to the  socio-economic development of our young people  both at the national and at the wider Pacific regional levels  in making submissions for assistance to its development partners.   The People’s Republic of China was able to respond positively to the call to provide critical infrastructure to meet the requirements of the Games. Similarly  in other key sectors such as education and health  Samoa’s other development partners have accepted our requests and agreed to work with us in our efforts to improve those vital areas.  The decision by the Economic and Social Council early this year to graduate Samoa from the status of least developed country is a clear reflection of the immense value to Samoa of the contribution of its development partners   including Australia  China  the European Union  Japan  New Zealand and a host of multilateral institutions  such as the United Nations  the World Bank  the Asian Development Bank  the International Monetary Fund and the Commonwealth  to name some.  As is well known  we argued strongly at the Economic and Social Council debate and at the General Assembly the case of the continued vulnerability of our small  isolated island economy  with all its attendant disadvantages  its lack of natural resources and its vulnerability to devastating natural disasters. None of those conditions and risks will disappear after Samoa graduates from the group of least developed countries. We therefore ask our development partners for their continued understanding and support of Samoa’s development efforts in the future.  People trapped in the different troubled spots of the world will not be able to experience true peace unless they are consulted and have a voice in any negotiated solution conducted in a spirit of genuine goodwill to find outcomes that create conditions for harmonious coexistence. Samoa therefore welcomes the recent attempt to resume the Middle East peace process and the new hope it rekindles that perhaps a durable solution may finally be achieved  where Palestinians live in a permanent and an independent State of their own alongside a secure and safe Israeli State.  The Sudan’s agreement to the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation is a courageous first step towards solving the humanitarian situation in Darfur and deserves full support. Hopefully  it will signal the end to the long and horrific suffering of innocent people caught in the midst of that tragic conflict.  Iraq’s early gains through its democratically elected Government are being eroded daily by disruptive elements bent on derailing the process to return the country to normalcy. Ultimately  it is the Iraqi leadership that should promote and manage any national reconciliation process to guarantee its long-term sustainability. However  it is also clear that  with the wider international community now able to play a more active role in Iraq  their understanding and contributions will be critical in helping with the efforts to bring peace to Iraq.  I have on previous occasions from this rostrum expressed Samoa’s unwavering support for the peacekeeping work of the United Nations. I again reaffirm that support  which is underpinned by my country’s contribution and involvement in the United Nations peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste  Liberia and the Sudan. Additionally  Samoa continues to be an integral part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands under the umbrella of the Pacific Forum.  Terrorist acts committed the world over  under whatever pretext or purpose  are deplorable and morally unjustified. In its various forms and manifestations  terrorism is responsible for the permanent scars of horror and fear that have gripped international attention in recent years. Terrorism should therefore be condemned in the strongest way possible  to send out the clear and unequivocal message that it is neither accepted nor condoned and that perpetrators should not expect any sympathy for their actions.  Samoa strongly supports the anti-terrorism resolutions of the United Nations. We have put in place the relevant legislative framework and have implemented measures in line with intergovernmental efforts to combat international terrorism.  In concluding my statement  I wish to again emphasize the important role of nations in key positions of leadership in the achievement of the objectives of the Organization  whether in peacekeeping  the environment  poverty alleviation  the fight against terrorism or the many other challenges that threaten our world. They must lead by good example  make decisions and take action based on the well-founded conviction that what they do is morally and ethically correct for the ultimate benefit and greater good of the world. When nations with leadership roles and responsibilities are able to do that  they will find ready support from the rest of the Organization’s membership. "
"187",7523,"YEM",62,2007,"Allow  me at the outset  Sir  to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I am confident that  with your wisdom and experience  you will lead our work to success. I wish you every success. I also wish to commend Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  from the sisterly Kingdom of Bahrain  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  for all her constructive and concrete efforts to ensure the success and positive results of the Assembly’s work.  The sixty-second session of the General Assembly coincides with the sixtieth anniversary of my country’s joining the United Nations  on 30 September 1947. The Republic of Yemen was one of the first countries to realize the importance of participating and interacting in an international forum that serves noble human objectives  the reason for which this Organization was established. We also became aware of the role of the United Nations in safeguarding international peace and security and in promoting cooperation among Member States with the aim of achieving prosperity for all societies.  On this occasion  I cannot fail to refer to the transformations that the Republic of Yemen has undergone since its inception on 22 May 1990  be it in human development  freedoms  democracy or protection of human rights. However  during the past two years in particular we have had significant success in establishing good governance and enlisting popular participation in local council elections  and we have embarked on an integrated ambitious programme for economic  political  social  judicial and administrative reform. This has come to be known as the National Reform Agenda.  The presidential and local elections held in September 2006  the transparency and fairness of which were attested to by all international observers  are evidence of the practice of democracy  freedom of expression  peaceful change of government  political pluralism  and decentralization in the management of State affairs. Yemen has also granted local councils broad authority. Several pieces of legislation to combat corruption were passed by the Yemeni Parliament  including the establishment of a Supreme Anti-Corruption Commission. They deal with procurement  tenders and bidding  and the establishment of an independent Commission  financial disclosure for public servants and basic reform in the judiciary. The Government now seeks to amend the laws that govern the press in order to remove all constraints.  Yemen has acceded to several international agreements relating to the fight against corruption  including the initiative of international transparency in the mining and extraction industry sector.  Today the world is witnessing political changes in Yemen: freedom of expression and of demonstration for its citizens  accorded to them by the constitution and by law. Even though some people have used these freedoms to cause anarchy and violence  the Government has dealt with them in consonance with the constitution and the law.  I reiterate that my country abides by the approach that it decreed for itself: democracy  political pluralism  peaceful change of authority and recourse to the ballot box as the best and only way for change. It is worth recalling here that the Government of Yemen has declared its intention to amend the constitution so as to reduce the presidential term of office from seven to five years and the term of office of Parliament members from six to four years. It also intends to amend the law pertaining to local administration  so that governors would be elected directly  and to turn local administration into local government  so that more decentralization and participation in governance can be realized.  As it moves along this path  Yemen faces several challenges in the areas of development  poverty and unemployment. These challenges compel Yemen to call on other States and on international organizations to help it overcome obstacles and to increase their development aid to Yemen  especially as the per capita assistance provided to the Yemeni individual does not meet the internationally accepted standard.  No one today questions the existence of global warming  the results of climate change that the world is experiencing  or the damage that is being inflicted on the environment. Hence  it is only natural to stress that we should all assume our common responsibility to contain the damage caused by some wrong-headed policies and practices  given that the devastating effects of such policies are evident to each and every one of us. Over the past year we have seen floods  hurricanes and global warming in many regions of the world. The future has in store more catastrophes that may affect or wipe out millions of people  especially in the third world. Consequently  the poor would continue to pay for the luxuries of the rich.  We would like to recall all the agreements relative to the environment and the resolutions that have been adopted at conferences to protect it. We should therefore seek to contain the climatic changes that result in desertification and flooding.  The tense situation in the Palestinian territories and the violence the Palestinian people are facing from the Israelis are matters that run contrary to the provisions of the United Nations Charter  international law  international agreements  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Fourth Geneva Convention. While the Arabs in the past have been criticized for not providing an Arab vision to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict  they were indeed surprised that  when they presented their own Arab Peace Initiative  it was totally ignored by Israel and the international community  in spite of all the elements that would secure a comprehensive and just solution to the conflict. Thus  it is our hope that the Arab follow-up committee of the Arab initiative will have created a positive atmosphere leading to an international conference to be held under international supervision to achieve peace in the Middle East. It is also our hope that the United States of America will keep its promise regarding the establishment of the Palestinian State on national soil  with Holy Jerusalem as its capital  based on the principles of total sovereignty  viability  and return of refugees; and we hope that the solution will be widened to include total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan and the Sheba’a farms. We emphasize the importance of the participation of all the parties concerned in the international conference to be held soon.  On this occasion  we call on our Palestinian brothers to return to dialogue  to unite their positions  to abide by the Arab Peace Initiative  to reorganize the Palestinian house in accordance with the constitution and Palestinian legitimacy. I refer here to the recent Yemeni initiative to bring the Palestinian factions together to serve the unity and ambitions of the Palestinian people.  The Republic of Yemen welcomes Security Council resolution 1770 (2007) on Iraq. From this rostrum it calls on the international community to stand with the elected Iraqi Government to extend its authority  to put an end to sectarian violence  to control all the armed militias and to face the terrorist elements that seek to spread anarchy and undermine legitimate resistance and efforts at national reconciliation. We emphasize the necessity for dialogue among all the national groups in Iraq in order to reach a common vision that could restore Iraq’s security and stability and its pioneering role in the region. The Republic of Yemen calls on everyone to stop interfering in the internal affairs of Iraq  to respect its unity and Arab character  to put an end to the occupation of its lands and to reject any plan to divide it.  Regarding the Sudan  we welcome its Government’s acceptance of an expansion of the forces and mandate of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. We support the efforts of the Sudanese Government to restore peace in that region in accordance with the security plan presented by the Security Council  provided that the sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of the Sudan will never be jeopardized under any pretext.   The Republic of Yemen blesses the reconciliation agreement signed by the Somali factions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  which came about as a result of African  Arab and international efforts. Yemen calls on all international actors to provide further assistance and support to the Transitional Federal Government in a manner that would enable it to rebuild Somalia. We emphasize the importance of providing enough African peacekeeping forces to stabilize and normalize the security situation in Somalia. That would hasten the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces. As has always been the case  the Republic of Yemen will remain a partner in the reconciliation process  supporting all the parties  rejecting any foreign intervention in Somalia and emphasizing the need for reconstruction in Somalia  with a view to enabling the Transitional Federal Government to rebuild State institutions.  The Republic of Yemen emphasizes the right of countries to possess nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. It continues to support a special General Assembly declaration of the Middle East as a zone free from all nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction  and resolutions demanding that Israel abide by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  in order to guarantee the stability of the region and to prevent a nuclear arms race there.  The Republic of Yemen emphasizes the importance of achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  adopted in 2000. We also support the objectives set out in the Monterrey Consensus. My country is convinced that the mobilization of financial resources for development and the effective use of those resources in developing countries and countries in economic transition  are two crucial areas in which true international partnership should be encouraged. It is worth mentioning that the responsibility of creating and managing development programmes is first and foremost the responsibility of national Governments  in accordance with their priorities  needs and specificities  and in keeping with international strategies stemming from the Millennium Development Goals. This should take place in partnership with donor countries and international organizations  and in accordance with national goals and programmes devoted to human development.   The Republic of Yemen wants the human being to be the centre and goal of its development and has placed the MDGs high among the priorities of its policies and its five-year development plan for the period 2006-2010. It has strenuously sought to take the social  economic and environmental dimensions of development into consideration. It has also involved civil society organizations in implementing these strategies. In addition  my country is working with donor countries  international specialized agencies and other institutions to implement our third five-year plan  with the objective of alleviating poverty by supporting small-scale programmes  expanding technical education  enabling women  providing investment services and opportunities and strengthening good governance. This is an ambitious plan that requires international support if it is to fully achieve its objectives of bringing about a qualitative change in human development in Yemen.   There have been difficulties  however  in the implementation of this ambitious reform programme  including frequent increases in the price of food stuffs  such as wheat flour  which has affected the standard of living of Yemeni citizens  placing increasingly heavy burdens on them. Accordingly  it is incumbent on rich States to consider how to deal with inflation in international markets  so that countries’ efforts to implement their reform programmes will not be jeopardized and so that those countries can strike a balance between the costs of reform on the one hand and living standards  social peace and political stability on the other.   In conclusion  allow me to express on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Yemen our deep thanks to the Secretary-General  His Excellency  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his sincere and strenuous efforts at the helm of the Organization. We are confident that he is capable of leading it with a view to bringing about justice and fulfilling the principles and values of the United Nations to which we all aspire. We look forward to his continued leadership  especially in the search for a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.  "
"188",7561,"YUG",62,2007,"I welcome the opportunity to address  on behalf of the Republic of Serbia  the General Assembly of the United Nations  the highest body of the world family of sovereign nations.  I congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his election to his very responsible post. I also congratulate the newly elected President of the General Assembly  Mr. Srdjan Kerim  who hails from our region of South-East Europe.  Serbia attaches exceptional importance to the role that the world Organization  and the Security Council in particular  play in maintaining international peace and security and in safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Member States. Proceeding from the Charter of the United Nations as the cornerstone of the current international legal order  Serbia calls for its consistent implementation.  The sixty-second session of the General Assembly is taking place at a very important moment for Serbia as the negotiation process on the future status of its province of Kosovo and Metohija is under way. Proceeding from the firm position that the independence of Kosovo is unacceptable to Serbia  we have offered special rights and competences to Kosovo Albanians for the autonomous development of their community within the Republic of Serbia.  In defence of the State sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia  our negotiating team has offered a decentralization model based on European solutions that would protect the interests of Kosovo Albanians  as well as the threatened interests of the Serbian and other non-Albanian ethnic communities in the province  in an effective way. Serbia offers solutions that would definitively solve  through mutual agreement and with the implementation of European values and rules  an old inter-ethnic conflict and open the prospects of reconciliation and coexistence within a modern  democratic and European Serbia. My country is ready to compromise  yet we wish to point out that the legitimate interests of democratic Serbia and the specific needs of the threatened Serbian community in the province  as well as of other communities that have fallen victim to expulsion  such as the Roma and Gorani communities  must be respected. Let me recall that more than 200 000 Serbs have left Kosovo since 1999; to date  according to the official data of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  only 7 100 have returned.  Today  negotiations are under way under the auspices of the Contact Group  but a legitimate decision on the future status of Kosovo can be taken only by the Security Council. Only a decision taken by that institution can be based on international law.  Persistent in our request that the territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia be respected  we call for the attainment of a compromise solution through diplomatic  legal and peaceful means  and not through war and violence. It is precisely for those reasons that democratic Serbia does not accept that the threat of violence made by the party we are negotiating with is an argument for redrawing the borders of legitimate democracies and for violating the norms of international law. My country is therefore steadfast in warning of the unforeseeable consequences of that unprincipled and dangerous policy  and remains committed to the search for a peaceful and compromise solution through dialogue and in full respect for the Charter of the United Nations.  Serbia would also like to recall that threats have been bandied about of late that the Kosovo Provisional Institutions will unilaterally declare independence on 11 December. We point that out because of the fact that the international legal order would never be the same following a one-sided recognition of Kosovo’s independence  while many separatist movements the world over would exploit the newly established precedent. Many regions in the world would thereby be destabilized. We therefore call on the legitimate representatives of the Kosovo Albanians to proceed to the resumed negotiations without prejudging the outcome  so that a compromise solution acceptable to both parties can be achieved  leading to long-term Serbian/Albanian reconciliation.  This year  Serbia is presiding over the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. In that capacity  we have made every effort to make a maximum contribution to the strengthening of democracy  the protection of human rights and the rule of law   the basic values of the oldest pan-European organization. We have also sought to strengthen synergy between the Council of Europe and the United Nations  especially in the field of human rights.  It is in the strategic interest of Serbia to become a member of the European Union. We are working hard to become a candidate member by the end of 2008. We are engaged in the process of Euro-Atlantic integration through the Partnership for Peace programme. We have thereby clearly evinced our acceptance of European values and our readiness to develop our country in accordance with the highest European standards.  We are convinced that the European perspective on the entire Western Balkans is the most effective way to stabilize the situation and accelerate the development of all countries in the region. Only thus shall we overcome the problems inherited from the past and encourage a spirit of tolerance and commitment to the same goals and values  which will provide a basis for building stable and lasting peace in our region.  Unfortunately  the question of war crimes continues to burden relations among Balkan countries. For its part  Serbia has done everything within its power to track down  arrest and transfer to The Hague those accused of war crimes  thereby demonstrating its commitment to cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to a successful end. That is not only Serbia’s international obligation; above all  it is our debt to ourselves and to our neighbours. By punishing criminals and building a stable and prosperous region  a common space integrated into the European Union  we can ensure a better future for all citizens.  It is with pleasure and optimism that we note that  step by step  South-East Europe is becoming a region of good-neighbourliness and cooperation. There are numerous examples of very successful initiatives and concrete forms of cooperation  the contribution of which to the promotion of peace and mutual trust is exceptionally important. There is hardly any field in which we have not yet established a mechanism of mutual cooperation. That proves unequivocally that this is a lasting  strategic orientation of all countries in the Balkans and a reflection of their common aspiration to the full inclusion of our region into European integration. (spoke in English)  Global problems call for global answers  and all Member States are therefore required to participate actively in their solution. Today  as we face completely new and specific challenges that threaten international peace and security and pose a threat to overall development and prosperity  we are becoming increasingly aware of the great need   perhaps greater than ever before   for the United Nations.  Terrorism is one of the greatest scourges of the present-day world. In order to fight and eradicate it effectively  we must take a global  coordinated approach  as well as vigorous action at the regional and country levels. Last year  Serbia hosted the regional summit meeting on terrorism  organized crime and corruption.  As can be seen  we cooperate very closely with our neighbours in order to forestall threats. An excellent example of that cooperation was the recent joint exercise of the armies of Serbia  Romania and Bulgaria  which provided abundant evidence of our three countries’ collective readiness to combat terrorism and any other threat to the security of our citizens. Serbia also initiated the signing of an agreement with neighbouring countries on cooperation in the protection against natural disasters. The recent catastrophic fires that engulfed Greece and the manner in which we reacted provided eloquent proof of the vital importance of mutual dependence and solidarity in the Balkan region.  Numerous crises continue to plague the world. Some are dormant  some are escalating  while others threaten to provoke conflicts that could engender dangerous consequences  destruction and humanitarian catastrophes. Our experience to date makes us believe even more firmly that lasting  just and stable peace and security can be achieved only peacefully  through dialogue  mutual respect and cooperation.  Serbia believes that the United Nations continues to be an irreplaceable international authority and mechanism for the prevention of crises and the resolution of conflicts. Successful and timely deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces is an important aspect of the maintenance of international peace and security. We support the efforts of the Organization to further strengthen the efficiency of its peacekeeping capacities. Serbia therefore considers that only gathered together around common goals and objectives and united in action can we make a vigorous stand against such global threats to international peace and security as terrorism  bellicose extremism  mass poverty  organized crime  pandemic diseases and the harmful consequences of climate change.  Global warming is surely a major problem of our age and rightly figures as one of the central topics on the agenda of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. That phenomenon   which  arguably  may affect all humankind   knows no national borders and circumvents no part of the world. To solve it  therefore  we must address it very seriously  as it brooks no delay and all Member States must get on board. Within the Belgrade Initiative  Serbia has proposed that activities to stop global warming be carried out also at the regional level and that a regional centre for South-East Europe be set up in Belgrade to that end. We also emphasize that plans to reduce harmful emissions must take into consideration the level of the economic development of various countries as well.  The complex of relations among different cultures  civilizations and religions is also a question that deserves to be at the focus of the attention of the United Nations. A truly multi-ethnic  multi-confessional and multi-cultural country  Serbia fully understands all the sensitivity of those questions and treats them with due attention. We are well aware that the world of the twenty-first century must not be based on intolerance on any ground. We  the leaders of the United Nations Member States  are entrusted with a great responsibility to make every effort to ensure that all the diversity of this world be comprehended and accepted as the wealth of all  rather than as the cause of new divisions. Indeed  dialogue and mutual tolerance must prevail as the basic principles of our mutual relations  both within States and internationally. As a responsible member of the world community and international organizations  Serbia fully respects the Charter of the United Nations and the international legal order established by the Charter. Building a truly democratic society in our own country  we call for the democratization of international relations on the basis of the strict implementation of the Charter and other generally accepted norms and standards.  We firmly believe that only equitable cooperation among countries and peoples  respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms  and mutual trust can guarantee stable international peace and security. At the same time  short of the political stability and economic prosperity of States  there is no successful cooperation at the bilateral  regional and global levels. The precondition for stability and dynamic economic development is equal access to new technologies and modern scientific achievements. (spoke in French)  The Republic Serbia is willing and ready  alongside other countries  to be actively involved in the process of United Nations reform and revitalization in order to make the world Organization capable of effectively facing the challenges of our times. Our historic responsibility is to ensure future generations a much better environment than that in which we live today. The Republic of Serbia remains devoted to achieving the goals of the United Nations and  along with other countries  is ready to work on further strengthening the integrity of the world Organization under its Charter.

"189",7589,"ZAF",62,2007,"Let me begin by adding my voice to the many salutations directed to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on being elected as the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I wish him a fruitful tenure of office  trusting that through his work the poor of the world will have good reason to increase their confidence in this Organization of the nations of the world.  Again  I reiterate the many thanks to Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al Khalifa  for the good work she did as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Equally  my congratulations go to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.  We meet here today  under the theme of responding to climate change  at this session  which marks the half-way point in the freely agreed period during which the nations of the world committed themselves to work  individually and collectively  to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Billions of the people of the world know as a matter of fact that the consequences of climate change   be it droughts  floods or unpredictable and extreme weather patterns   undermine our common efforts to achieve the MDGs. Today  we all understand that the costs of doing nothing about climate change far outweigh those of taking concrete measures to address this challenge. It is clear that delaying action on this matter of climate change will hit poor countries and communities hardest. Yet the pace of climate change negotiations is out of step with the urgency indicated by science.  I would therefore urge that we collectively aim for a significant advance in the multilateral negotiations when our negotiators meet in Bali in December this year. Together  we must ensure that we build a fair  effective  flexible and inclusive climate regime under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol  and we must agree to this as a matter of urgency. Though we have different responsibilities  and developed countries clearly have an obligation to take the lead  we all have a common duty to do more and act within our respective capabilities and in accordance with our national circumstances.  The World Summit on Sustainable Development correctly reaffirmed sustainable development as a central element of the global action against poverty and the protection of the environment and identified important linkages between poverty  the environment and the use of natural resources. These linkages are real to billions of the poor; the combination of their empty stomachs  their degraded environment and their exploited natural resources  for which they benefit nothing  defines hopelessness and a heart-wrenching existence.  Many of these wretched of the Earth know from their bitter experience how their resource-rich areas were transformed into arid  uninhabitable and desolate areas forcing migration to better-endowed regions  thus exacerbating conflicts and the struggle for scarce resources.  Gathered here as representatives of the peoples of the world  we know very well that climate change  poverty and underdevelopment are not acts of God but human-made.  Clearly  the starting point for a future climate regime must be equity. A core balance between sustainable development and climate imperatives will have to be the basis of any agreement on a strengthened climate regime. Any deal on fair use of the ecological space will have to be balanced by a deal giving all countries a fair chance in the development space.  Under the aegis of the United Nations  but also within our regional bodies  we have adopted many programmes and declarations  with clear implementation targets aimed at addressing the challenges of climate change  poverty and underdevelopment. As this conclave knows very well  the many lofty agreements include  among others  those adopted at the Rio Earth Summit  the Copenhagen Social Summit  the Millennium Summit  the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development. At all these summits and others  we have adopted declarations using moving and solemn words that express our profound understanding of the gravity of the challenges facing the modern world and have unequivocally committed ourselves to defeating any and all of the miserable and dehumanizing conditions facing large parts of humanity.  Indeed  this collective asserted  in paragraph 11 of the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2):    “We will spare no effort to free our fellow men  women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. ... We are committed to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want.” Yet the poor  whose hopes have been raised many times as we have made declaration after declaration against poverty and underdevelopment   and as we are doing now on climate change   can be forgiven for thinking that this important global leadership often sounds like an empty vessel.   That this collective is able to express  always eloquently  the dire circumstances characterizing poverty is without doubt. However  this Organization  which should pride itself on visible actions and results in the fight against climate change and poverty  finds it difficult to demonstrate decisive progress in that regard. The reasons for that are not hard to find. Although the concepts of freedom  justice and equality are universal and fully embraced by the United Nations  this global Organization has not itself transformed and designed necessary institutions of governance that are consistent with the noble ideals that drive modern democratic societies.  Because the nations of the world are defined by the dominant and the dominated  the dominant have always become the decision-makers in the important global forums  including at this seat of global governance. Accordingly  the skewed distribution of world power   political  economic  military  technological and social   replicates itself in multilateral institutions  much to the disadvantage of the majority of the poor people of the world.  Indeed  even as we agree on the important programmes that should bring a better life to the billions of poor  the rich and the powerful have consistently sought to ensure that  whatever happens  the existing power relations are not altered and therefore that the status quo remains. The results of that situation are that the United Nations can and does correctly identify problems and appropriate solutions necessary for making the world a better place for all of humanity. Naturally  the dominant and the powerful very often respond positively to agreed programmes if these would advance their own narrow interests.  At the same time  the poor will continue to strive for improvement of their wretched conditions. They therefore see the United Nations as a natural instrument for helping to accelerate the process of change for the better. Hence  they correctly see implementation of all United Nations programmes as being central to the efforts relating to climate change and the struggle against poverty and underdevelopment.  Yet the cold reality is that it will be difficult for the United Nations  in its present form  to fully implement its own decisions and therefore to help the poor to swiftly achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Indeed  until the ideals of freedom  justice and equality characterize this premier world body itself  the dominant will forever dictate to the dominated  and the interests of the dominated   which are those of the majority of humanity   will be deferred in perpetuity. Thus  noble statements will continue to be uttered on all matters facing the majority of the people of the world  such as the need to successfully conclude the Doha Development Round  while little is done to implement the many critical agreements necessary to pull the poor out of the morass of poverty and underdevelopment.  We in my own country are of the firm belief that we will achieve the MDGs. Having emerged from more than three centuries of colonialism and apartheid  we inherited two interlinked economies  which we characterize as the first and second economies. The two economies   one developed and globally connected and the other localized and informal   display many features of a global system of apartheid. As South Africans  we have sought to strengthen the first economy and to use it as a base for the transfer of resources to strengthen and modernize the second economy  and thus embark on the process of changing the lives of those who subsist in the second economy.  Indeed  without the requisite resource transfers  it will not be possible to achieve the MDGs  because our second economy cannot on its own generate the resources needed to bring a better life to millions of poor South Africans. I mention this because  as we all accept  central to the global attainment of the MDGs is the critical matter of resource transfers from the rich countries of the North to the poor countries of the South.  Many developing countries   especially those of my own continent  Africa   do not have the material base from which to address and attain the MDGs on their own. Accordingly  there is an urgent need for massive resource transfers through development assistance  investment  trade  technology transfers and human resource development to these poor countries if we are to achieve the MDGs and successfully adapt to the devastating impacts of climate change.  If we do not succeed in building a climate change regime that balances adaptation and mitigation  underpinned by the transfer of technology and financial resources  we will place an unmanageable burden on future generations. In that regard  given Africa’s specific and dire challenges  we believe it is important to enter into a partnership with Africa using the African Union’s programme the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  which the Assembly has adopted  so that the measures that the continent has undertaken  with limited resources  for the regeneration of all the African countries can be strengthened by support from the international community  guided by the programmes of the United Nations.  As history teaches us  it was because of the massive resource transfers in the aftermath of the Second World War that Western Europe recovered and was set on its development path. A similar intervention helped to put a number of Asian countries on their own development trajectory. The question we should ask is  why is there an absence of the same resolve to assist poor nations today? The global village to which we constantly refer should encourage us to expand human solidarity. Thus  we would build a durable bridge over the river dividing our common global village and regrettably ensuring that one human being lives a fulfilling life while another experiences a miserable existence.  Representing the citizens of the world  we have set for ourselves programmes requiring that all of us work together to create better living conditions for humanity and ensure that we achieve that which is necessary for our mutual prosperity.  Together  rich and poor  developed and developing  North and South  we can and must truly hold hands and address the challenges of climate change and sustainable development  work together to defeat poverty and underdevelopment and ensure that every human being is saved from the indecencies and humiliations that are inseparable from poverty. But to do that  we need first and foremost to implement the decisions that we have adopted freely in this eminent house of the representatives of the global community. And so  let our actions speak louder than our words.  "
"190",7631,"ZMB",62,2007,"Allow me at the outset to convey my warm congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. My delegation is confident that with his immense wealth of experience  he will steer the session very successfully. Zambia assures him of its total support during his tenure of office.  Let me  at this point  pay tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the fourth Secretary-General of the United Nations  and later President of Austria  who died on  14 June 2007. To us  he was a great diplomat who made Africa one of his priorities  especially at the height of the liberation struggle in Southern Africa.  May I take this opportunity to thank Her Excellency Sheikha Rashed Al Khalifa of Bahrain for having presided over the affairs of the sixty-first session in an exemplary manner. Among her accomplishments was the carrying forward of the United Nations reforms called for at the 2005 World Summit. It was gratifying to have a lady preside over the highest office of the General Assembly after almost three decades of male dominance. I hope that this organ will not again take that long to have an excellent woman as President.  Let me now congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-moon of the Republic of Korea on his election as the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations. I am confident that he will build upon the strong foundation that was laid by his predecessor  Kofi Annan of Ghana  to whom I wish to pay tribute for the manner in which he steered the Organization during his tenure in office. He made Africa proud  and I wish him success in his current and future endeavours.  Our world today presents many challenges. These include abject poverty for the majority of the world’s inhabitants  underdevelopment  conflict  human trafficking  climate change  terrorism  violations of human rights  the HIV/AIDS pandemic and gender inequality. While some of these challenges have only recently emerged  others have been with us from time immemorial. These challenges cannot be entirely resolved within national boundaries or at the regional level. They can be resolved only at the multilateral level  with all the players carrying out their roles diligently. For that reason  Zambia supports a strong and coherent United Nations. We agree with the recommendation of the High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence that the United Nations urgently needs more coherence and synergy. That will enable it to perform as one and to use its unique universality  neutrality and capacity to operate efficiently.  Furthermore  Zambia supports the ongoing reforms of the United Nations. In particular  we welcome the mandate given to the Economic and Social Council to make it more effective in executing its duties  which include formulating policy recommendations on international and social issues  as well as coordinating activities of specialized agencies in the economic  social and related fields. In that regard  collaboration of the United Nations with the international financial institutions and the World Trade Organization should be further enhanced; we welcome the work going on in this area.  This brings me to another issue: reform of the Security Council. This matter has remained unresolved for more than a decade. United Nations reform cannot be complete without meaningful reform of the Security Council. Any new proposals to reform that vital organ should seriously consider Africa’s call to have two permanent seats with full veto power. Africa is aware that the veto is an undemocratic instrument and would prefer to do away with it altogether. However  as long as others insist on keeping the veto  Africa should have it as well. The status quo is unacceptable. It is my hope that during Mr. Kerim’s tenure of office  this aspect of the reform process will be concluded successfully.  The issue of climate change is very important to the current and future inhabitants of our planet. It is therefore fitting that one theme of this session is responding to climate change. I commend the Secretary-General for organizing the 24 September 2007 high-level event on this matter. Indeed  the effects of climate change are being felt mostly by the developing countries. For instance  Southern Africa is experiencing critical food shortages due to torrential rains in some areas and severe drought in other parts of the region.  The problem of climate change is a global issue requiring global action within the multilateral context of the United Nations. As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol  Zambia has already taken several measures to implement those international instruments. In that regard  we submitted our first national communication report in 2004. We have also taken deliberate steps to create public awareness about the problem of climate change so that our people can devise appropriate local interventions.  Regarding measures aimed at adapting to climate change  Zambia has just finished formulating its National Adaptation Programme of Action. The programme will help us identify the most vulnerable sectors of our economy  as well as adaptation activities required to alleviate the adverse effects of climate change. For this reason  we call upon the international community to ensure that the Adaptation Fund under the Climate Change Convention  which has taken rather long to establish  is made operational.  While placing emphasis on adaptation  we also pledge to reduce emissions from industrial and other sources. We call upon industrialized countries  which have a history of producing these emissions  to take serious steps to reduce them. We believe that the situation is now serious and that narrow national interests in this matter must be discarded forthwith.  As a developing country  Zambia needs assistance to enhance its capacity in key adaptive areas  such as scientific research  early warning and rapid response  to address the adverse effects of climate change. Accordingly  Zambia calls for the speedy development and transfer of appropriate technologies to help us cope with the negative impacts of climate change  as well as to put us on a low-carbon path to economic growth. We also call for a more comprehensive institutional framework for international environmental governance.  In 2000  the developing world embraced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a comprehensive strategy to move our countries out of economic and social decline and better integrate us into the global economy. Halfway through the implementation period  many countries are far from attaining most of the Goals. That is so in spite of the improved economic performance recorded by some developing countries following recent debt relief initiatives  coupled with sustained prudent economic management.  To illustrate the point  in Zambia the economy grew by 6.2 per cent last year  and inflation declined to a single digit level for the first time in 30 years. Those economic gains  however  have not translated into a significant decline in the incidence of poverty  which stands at 68 per cent. Zambia’s development efforts are further compromised by the HIV/AIDS pandemic and  now  the adverse effects of climate change.  With regard to the HIV/AIDS pandemic  my Government has declared it to be a national crisis  requiring sustained mitigation and preventive measures. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our cooperating partners for their support to Zambia in the fight against HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria.  Despite these challenges  Zambia  for its part  has made steady progress and is likely to meet most of the MDGs by 2015. The Goals most likely not to be attained by 2015 are: reducing by three quarters the maternal mortality ratio  integrating the principles of sustainable development into the country’s policies and programmes and reversing the loss of environmental resources. Our goal now is to translate the economic achievements into tangible improvements in the quality of life of the Zambian people. That goal is enshrined in Zambia’s Vision 2030  which is aimed at raising the country to middle-income status  significantly reducing hunger and poverty and fostering a competitive and outward-oriented economy.  But that goal will remain elusive if our cooperating partners do not fulfil their commitments. Indeed  it is saddening to note that total official development assistance declined in real terms by 5.1 per cent between 2005 and 2006  and only five donor countries have met or exceeded the 0.7 per cent target. I urge the cooperating partners to fulfil their commitments. Furthermore  while Zambia welcomes the discussions and progress made on aid effectiveness following the Paris Declaration  we call for official development assistance to be delivered in a more efficient manner  in accordance with the Declaration.  Aid cannot be effective unless corruption is uprooted. My Government has  therefore  declared war against that social vice. Accordingly  I take this opportunity to urge the international community to desist from providing safe havens for leaders who plunder national resources. Such ill-gotten wealth should be returned to the countries from where it was misappropriated so that it can be used to fight poverty.  Zambia condemns international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. For this reason  we call upon members of the international community to refrain from harbouring terrorists. Zambia  for its part  supports the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.  Through regional bodies  such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  developing countries enhance their ability to cooperate and also jointly negotiate for better access to developed countries’ markets. Consequently  during Zambia’s current chairmanship of SADC  we shall continue to consolidate the formation of the SADC free trade area by 2008 as a prerequisite to the Regional Customs Union. In addition  Zambia will  on behalf of SADC  seek funding to develop an adequate regional transboundary infrastructure in support of  much-needed connectivity in areas such as water  transport  energy  communications and information technology.  Many regions  including Africa  have been dogged by conflict. This has adversely affected the countries’ potential to participate in the global economic arena. In the quest for peace in our subregion  SADC has launched a stand-by brigade  which will have the capacity for peace support operations. It is our hope that the international community will render necessary support to the brigade to enable it to fulfil its mandate.  Better still  SADC and Zambia value the tenets of democracy  political stability and integrated economic development as the ultimate sound basis for peace and stability. SADC will  therefore  continue to promote the conducting of free and fair elections in the region.  Mr. Berdymukhammedov (Turkmenistan)  Vice-President  took the Chair  In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm  with regard to the theme of this session  Zambia’s commitment to cooperate with the international community in addressing the problem of climate change. It is my sincere hope that all of us will play our full part  according to our abilities to deal with this serious global challenge. To that end  we should not remain indecisive and indifferent to this serious issue. Neither should we miss the opportunity to do what we can to make the world a better place to live in. "
"191",7667,"ZWE",62,2007,"Allow me to congratulate Mr. Kerim on his election to preside over this Assembly. We are confident that through his stewardship  issues on the agenda of the sixty-second session will be dealt with in a balanced manner and to the satisfaction of all. Allow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor  Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  who steered the work of the sixty-first session in a very competent and impartial manner. Her ability to identify the crucial issues facing the world today will be remembered as the hallmark of her presidency.  We extend our hearty welcome to the new Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who has taken up this challenging job requiring dynamism in confronting the global challenges of the twenty-first century. Balancing global interests and steering the United Nations in a direction that gives hope to the multitudes of the poor  the sick  the hungry and the marginalized is indeed a mammoth task. We would like to assure him that Zimbabwe will continue to support an open  transparent and all-inclusive multilateral approach in dealing with those global challenges.  Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time. Its negative impact is greatest in developing countries  particularly those on the African continent. We believe that  if the international community is going to seriously address the challenges of climate change  then we need to get our priorities right. In Zimbabwe  the effects of climate change have become more evident in the past decade as we have witnessed  alongside our neighbours  increased and recurrent droughts  as well as occasional floods  leading to enormous humanitarian challenges.  We are for a United Nations that recognizes the equality of sovereign nations and peoples  whether big or small. We are averse to a body in which the economically and militarily powerful behave like bullies  trampling on the rights of weak and smaller States  as sadly happened in Iraq. In the light of those inauspicious developments  this Organization must surely examine the essence of its authority and the extent of its power when challenged in this manner.  Such challenges to the authority of the United Nations and its Charter underpin our repeated call for the revitalization of the General Assembly  itself the most representative organ of the United Nations. The General Assembly should be more active in all areas  including those of peace and security. The encroachment of some United Nations organs upon the work of the General Assembly is of great concern to us. Thus  any process of revitalizing or strengthening the General Assembly should necessarily avoid eroding the principle of the accountability of all principal and subsidiary organs to the General Assembly.  Once again  we reiterate our position that the Security Council as presently constituted is not democratic. In its present configuration  the Council has shown that it is not in a position to protect the weaker States  who find themselves at loggerheads with a marauding super-Power. Most importantly  justice demands that any Security Council reform should redress the fact that Africa is the only continent without a permanent seat and veto power in the Security Council. Africa's demands are known and enunciated in the Ezulwini Consensus.  We further call for the United Nations system to refrain from interfering in matters that are clearly the domain of Member States and are not a threat to international peace and security. Development at country level should continue to be country-led and not be subject to the whims and caprices of powerful donor States.  Zimbabwe won its independence on 18 April 1980 after a protracted war against British colonial imperialism that denied its people human rights and democracy. That colonial system which suppressed and oppressed us enjoyed the support of many countries of the West who were signatories to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Even after 1945  it would appear that the Berlin Conference of 1884  through which Africa was parcelled out to colonial European powers  has remained stronger than the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is  therefore  clear that for the West  vested economic interests and racial and ethnocentric considerations have proved stronger than Western adherence to principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  The West still negates our sovereignties by controlling our resources  in the process making us mere chattels in our own lands  mere minders of the Westâ€™s transnational interests. In my own country and other sister States in southern Africa  the most visible form of this colonial control has been control over land despoiled from us at the onset of British colonialism. That control largely persists  although it stands firmly challenged in Zimbabwe  thereby triggering the current stand-off between us and Britain  which is supported by her cousin States  most notably the United States and Australia. Mr. Bush  Mr. Blair and now  Mr. Brown's sense of human rights precludes our people's right to their God-given resources  which must  in our view  be controlled by our people. I am termed dictator - and yesterday the General Assembly heard Mr. Bush in this Hall calling my Government a demagogic regime â€” because I have rejected this supremacist view and frustrated the neo-colonialists in their endeavours to keep us as slaves in our own country.  Clearly  the history of the struggle for our own national and people's rights is unknown to the President of the United States of America. He thinks the Declaration of Human Rights started with his terms in office. He thinks he can introduce to us  who bore the brunt of the struggle for the freedoms of our peoples  the virtues of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. What rank hypocrisy! I spent  11 precious years of my life in the jail of a white Englishman whose freedom and well being I assured and protected from the first day of Zimbabwe's independence  and that was Ian Smith. I lost a further 15 years fighting white injustice in my country. Ian Smith was responsible for the deaths of well over 50 000 of my people. I bear scars of his tyranny  which Britain and America condoned. I meet his victims every day. Yet  he walks freely today. He farms freely; he has a farm of over 500 hectares. He talks freely  associates freely under our black Government. We taught him democracy. We gave him back his humanity. He would have faced a different fate here and in Europe  if the 50 000 he killed had been Europeans. Africa has not called for a Nuremberg trial against the white world  which committed heinous crimes against humanity. It has not hunted perpetrators of this genocide  many of whom live to this day; nor has it received reparations from those who have offended against it. Instead  it is Africa that is in the dock. It is Mugabe  and not the British Prime Minister  who is in the dock  facing trial from the same world that persecuted us for centuries.  Let Mr. Bush read history correctly. Let him realize that  both personally and in his representative capacity as the current President of the United States  he stands for this ""civilization"" that occupied  colonized  incarcerated and killed. He has much to atone for and very little to lecture us about on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. His hands drip with the innocent blood of many nationalities  and  today  with the blood of the Iraqis. But he still kills. He kills in Iraq. He kills in Afghanistan. And he is supposed to be our teacher in human rights?  He imprisons. He imprisons and tortures at Guantanamo. He imprisoned and tortured at Abu Ghraib. He has secret torture chambers in Europe. Yes  he imprisons even here in the United States  with his jails today carrying more blacks than his universities can ever enrol. He even suspends the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Take GuÃ¡ntanamo for example. At that concentration camp  international law does not apply. The national laws of the people there do not apply. Laws of the United States of America do not apply. Only Bush's law applies. Can the international community accept being lectured by this man on the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? Definitely not.  The President returned to the Chair.  We are alarmed that under his leadership basic rights of his own people and those of the rest of the world have summarily been rolled back. America is primarily responsible for rewriting core tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We all seem guilty for 9/11. Mr. Bush thinks he stands above all structures of governance  whether national or international. At home  he apparently does not need the Congress. He defies it. Abroad  he does not need the United Nations; he does not need international law and opinion. â€œI will go to Iraq â€ he said  â€œwith or without the United Nationsâ€ â€” that is  with or without international law  in defiance of it.   This forum did not sanction Blairâ€™s and Bushâ€™s misadventures in Iraq. Did we say yes to it? Did we say yes to the attack on Iraq? The two rode roughshod over the United Nations and international opinion. Almighty Bush: perhaps some might regard him as their god. No  he is not my god. I have but one God. He is in heaven â€” pater noster  qui es in caelis. Indeed  he wants us to pray to him. We say no to him and encourage him to get out of Iraq. Indeed  he should mend his ways before he clambers up the pulpit to deliver pieties of democracy. Is he qualified to speak of democracy? Is he qualified to speak of human rights when he is shedding blood every day?  The British and the Americans have gone on a relentless campaign of destabilizing and vilifying my country. They have sponsored surrogate forces to challenge lawful authority in my country. They seek regime change. It is they who seek regime change  not my people. But they think they are entitled to change governments  placing themselves in the role of the Zimbabwean people in whose collective will democracy places the right to define and change regimes. And they want to talk of democracy when they are behaving that way.   Let those sinister Governments be told here and now that Zimbabwe will not allow a regime change authored by outsiders. We do not interfere with their systems in America and Britain  where they steal elections  as he did during his first election. We do not interfere. Mr. Bush and Mr. Brown have no role to play in our national affairs. They are outsiders - and mischievous outsiders - and should therefore keep out. The colonial sun set a long time ago in Africa - in 1980 in the case of Zimbabwe. And hence  Zimbabwe will never be a colony again - never  ever.  We do not deserve sanctions. We are Zimbabweans and we know how to deal with our own problems. We have done so in the past  well before Bush and Brown were known politically. We have our own regional and continental organizations and communities. In that vein  I wish to express my countryâ€™s gratitude to President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa who  on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  successfully facilitated the dialogue between my ruling party and the opposition parties  which yielded the agreement that has now resulted in the constitutional provisions being finally adopted the amendments to the constitution  which both parties agreed to and which paved the way to the elections for which various parties are now campaigning. Consequently  we will be holding multiple democratic elections in March 2008. Indeed  we have always had timeous general and presidential elections since our independence.  We want to be left alone. We will interact with those in our region and those in organizations to which we belong.  In conclusion  let me stress once more that the strength of the United Nations lies in its universality and its impartiality as it implements its mandate to promote peace and security  economic and social development  human rights and international law  as outlined in the Charter. Zimbabwe stands ready to play its part in all efforts and programmes aimed at achieving those noble goals. The Charter of the United Nations is our Charter also in Africa and we uphold it. Wrath unto him who defies the Charter. "
