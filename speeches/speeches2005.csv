"1",35,"AFG",60,2005,"I have the honourto inform the members of the General Assembly of thesuccessful conclusion of the parliamentary andprovincial elections that took place in my country twodays ago. As stated by President Karzai  “the holdingof these elections was a major success for the people ofAfghanistan and a major defeat for those attempting toderail the political process”. In defiance of the threatsposed by the enemies of peace and stability inAfghanistan  Al-Qaida and the Taliban  millions ofmen and women enthusiastically travelled to pollingstations to cast their votes. With the conclusion ofthese elections  the Islamic Republic of Afghanistanhas now completed the final phase of the BonnAgreement  sponsored by the United Nations inDecember 2001.The determination and political will expressed bythe people of Afghanistan have made possible thegradual  yet arduous  transition towards stability anddemocracy in Afghanistan. During the course of thetransition  Afghanistan successfully convened two loyajirgas  adopted a new Constitution enshrining theprinciples of democracy  held its first-ever presidentialelections and  most recently  concluded itsparliamentary and provincial elections.In this context  allow me to express on behalf ofthe people and the Government of Afghanistan ourmost sincere gratitude and appreciation to the UnitedNations  the NATO-led International SecurityAssistance Force  coalition forces  ProvincialReconstruction Teams  international observers andother international partners for the assistance renderedtowards achieving this objective.Allow me to highlight briefly some of the otherachievements that have taken place during the past fouryears. The Government of Afghanistan continues tomake significant progress with regard to the reform ofthe security sector and the formation of the nationalarmy and police in order to further extend andconsolidate peace and authority throughout the country.The disarmament and demobilization of 60 000 formercombatants has been completed. In that regard  theGovernment of Afghanistan reaffirms its commitmentto complete the reintegration of ex-combatants as thefinal phase of a successful disarmament  demobilizationand reintegration process.Significant progress has been made in thepromotion and protection of human rights andfundamental freedoms. Our new Constitutionguarantees equal rights for men and women  freedomof expression  freedom of press and political pluralism.The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commissionhas been institutionalized as an independent body inaccordance with our Constitution. The Commissioncontinues to fulfil its mandate.We have also witnessed the enrolment of morethan 5 million children  both boys and girls  in school.Repatriation of millions of refugees from neighbouringcountries has also taken place during the past fouryears. The significant increase in the role of women inthe social  political and economic life of the country isalso worth mentioning.The cultivation of opium poppy and theproduction of narcotic drugs in Afghanistan remains aprime concern of my Government. The establishmentof a counter-narcotics ministry  the creation of aspecial tribunal to prosecute those associated with thecultivation  production and trafficking of illegal drugsand the formation of the Committee on Counter-Narcotics  chaired by President Karzai  are only someof the initiatives taken by the Afghan Governmentaimed at combating and eliminating the scourge ofnarcotic drugs.I am pleased to refer to the recent report of theUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  whichrightly reflected a 21 per cent decrease in thecultivation of opium poppy in Afghanistan during thecurrent year. However  in order to build on thisachievement  we must offer alternative livelihoods torural communities. A successful strategy in combatingillicit drugs requires additional measures aside from25asking farmers to plant substitute crops. We have toprovide them with agricultural assistance  invest inirrigation  build roads and provide electric power andassistance in generating non-farm employment in ruralareas.Many of the achievements realized inAfghanistan since the signing of the Bonn Agreementwould not have been possible without the vigoroussupport of the international community. I take thisopportunity to extend our deep gratitude to allinternational partners and lead nations which offeredgenerous support throughout the process. In thiscontext  we emphasize the importance of the sustainedengagement and support of the internationalcommunity over the coming years for the rehabilitationand reconstruction of Afghanistan  as well as for theconsolidation of peace and security.Despite the achievements to which I referredearlier  the people of Afghanistan continue to facemany challenges in their daily lives. Extreme poverty a high rate of infant and maternal mortality and a lackof resources necessary to ensure basic social servicescontinue to exist.The outcome document adopted on 16 September2005 (resolution 60/1) has laid the foundation for amore effective and efficient United Nations better ableto address issues relating to development  peace andsecurity  human rights  reform of the United Nationsand achievement of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals.The Government of Afghanistan welcomes theproposal adopted in the outcome document with regardto the establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission.As a country emerging from years of conflict Afghanistan fully understands the need for acoordinated  coherent and integrated approach to post-conflict peacebuilding. My Government also supportsthe decision that the Commission should begin its workby no later than 31 December 2005.As a result of ongoing efforts by Afghanistan andthe international community to combat internationalterrorism  my country no longer serves as a base forAl-Qaida and the Taliban. However  the people ofAfghanistan continue to suffer from the scourge ofinternational terrorism. Terrorism remains one of themain challenges to peace  stability and sustainabledevelopment in Afghanistan. The continued infiltrationof Al-Qaida and Taliban extremists in the south andparts of the east of the country remains a factorcontributing to insecurity in my country.We therefore reiterate the importance of a sincerecommitment by all the countries of the region tocombating that scourge. The Government ofAfghanistan once again vehemently condemnsterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In thatcontext  we support every effort aimed at thesuccessful conclusion of a comprehensive conventionon international terrorism by the end of the sixtiethsession of the General Assembly.The Secretary-General clearly highlighted theinterrelationship between development and security inhis report “In larger freedom” (A/59/2005)  which  inparagraph 2 of the annex  states  “There will be nodevelopment without security and no security withoutdevelopment”. The case of Afghanistan could not bemore relevant in that respect.Achieving the Millennium Development Goals inAfghanistan is not just a desirable humanitarianobjective  but a necessity for the security of thecountry  the region and the world. Attaining the Goalswill require a substantial amount of international aid provided in a coordinated and sustained manner.My Government is in the process of preparingAfghanistan’s national development strategy  whichwill be presented at the donor conference onAfghanistan scheduled to take place early next year.The national development strategy encompasses a clearapproach to achieving our national development goalsand addresses vital areas such as capacity-building fiscal sustainability  building infrastructure andprioritizing projects. The Afghanistan nationaldevelopment strategy will also present Afghanistan’soverarching strategy for promoting growth andreducing poverty  and will serve as the country’soverall strategy for attracting international assistance.The national development strategy will beprepared in a consultative process with allstakeholders  including donors  civil society  theprivate sector and provincial councils. Through a post-Bonn compact  Afghanistan will subscribe to a new setof timetables and benchmarks for providing security building democratic institutions  protecting humanrights and reducing extreme poverty in accordancewith our MDG targets  reforming the administration eliminating corruption  ending the production of and26traffic in narcotic drugs and developing cooperationwith our neighbours.As a landlocked country  Afghanistan will not beable to achieve its intended economic goals without thesupport and mutual cooperation of its neighbours. TheGovernment of Afghanistan emphasizes the importanceof regional economic cooperation for the benefit of allcountries in the region. Trade plays a major role inpromoting economic growth  employment anddevelopment for all. The volume of trade betweenAfghanistan and its neighbours has been growingsteadily. Just last year  the estimated value of tradebetween Afghanistan and its neighbours amounted to$1.5 billion.I would like in conclusion to expressAfghanistan’s full commitment to the implementationof the outcome document. We are of the conviction thatthe adoption of that historic document will furtherenhance the central role of the United Nations inaddressing the threats and challenges facing humanityat the dawn of the twenty-first century."
"2",74,"AGO",60,2005,"It is with greathonour that I take this floor before this Assembly. Atthe outset  I should like to congratulate the President on behalf of the Government of the Republic ofAngola  for his election to the presidency of thesixtieth session of the General Assembly of ourOrganization.I also wish to express my appreciation to hispredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  for his commitment and forthe transparent and efficient manner in which hepresided over the fifty-ninth session of GeneralAssembly.Today  60 years after the foundation of the UnitedNations  humanity continues to face new and complexchallenges. The continuation of armed conflicts hunger  poverty  massive human rights violations  thespread of HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  the scarof terrorism and the risk that non-State actors canacquire  develop and use weapons of mass destructionindeed constitute a threat to international peace andsecurity. Therefore  the international community hasevery reason to act collectively to reform andstrengthen the United Nations in order to render itbetter prepared to address the many and complexchallenges we are facing.The Republic of Angola follows with greatconcern the developments in several areas of the world particularly on the African continent. In spite of arelatively positive tendency characterized by adecrease in areas of tension in the world today  it isnecessary to continue to pay special attention to thepeace processes in various parts of the world particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Côte d’Ivoire  Sudan and Guinea-Bissau  to mentiononly a few.Regarding Guinea-Bissau  my delegation issatisfied with the results achieved  and we commendthe political maturity shown by the people of Guinea-Bissau during the transition period  particularly thecivic responsibility demonstrated during the period ofpresidential elections.In this context  we believe that respect for theconstitutionally established institutions of sovereigntyis an indispensable condition for political stability.Only this will create a propitious environment for theaccomplishment of tasks that guarantee themaintenance of peace and economic reconstruction.Such is the expectation of the Guinean people  whowent to voting stations in such significant numbers.That is a vote for democracy.In that connection  we welcome the round tableon Guinea-Bissau  scheduled for the month ofNovember  and we urge donors to respond positivelysince the international community’s assistance remainsa fundamental condition for the process under way.Regarding the process of consolidation of peacecurrently in progress in the Great Lakes region Angola  in its capacity as a core country  is pleasedwith what has been achieved so far. We thank theGroup of Friends  and particularly the Government of35Canada  for the support they have been providing  andespecially for the second Great Lakes Conference  dueto be held next November in Nairobi.Although we understand that the primaryresponsibility to prevent and resolve conflicts in Africafalls upon African States themselves  we share thenotion that the international community should  inpartnership with regional and subregionalorganizations  play a more significant role in theprevention and resolution of conflicts on the continent.Based on our own experience  we believe that inorder for strategies for the prevention and resolution ofconflicts to be successful  they should be based on anapproach that is as inclusive as possible. In thisconnection  the cooperation of the key organs of theUnited Nations — the General Assembly  the SecurityCouncil and the Economic and Social Council — isabsolutely essential. The pertinent involvement of theinternational financial institutions  as well as theprivate and business sectors  has proven to be equallyfundamental.For this reason  we support and welcome thedecision of the High-level Meeting to create thePeacebuilding Commission. We are ready to work withpartners towards rendering this organ operational assoon as possible.Angola supports the creation of the permanentfund for the consolidation of peace. We are also of theview that activities related to disarmament demobilization and reintegration should be financedfrom the regular budget and attributed to peacekeepingoperations.While the illicit exploitation of natural resourceswas not mentioned in the outcome document of thesummit  we hope that during the current session of theGeneral Assembly this issue will be given dueconsideration since it constitutes a fundamentalelement for the strategy of prevention and resolution ofconflicts.Terrorism undoubtedly constitutes a permanentthreat to the world that no country can face alone.Therefore  it calls for cooperation among all countries with the United Nations playing the central role in thefight against it. In this connection  we join theSecretary-General’s plea for the conclusion  as urgentlyas possible  of the comprehensive convention againstinternational terrorism  which would contain auniversally accepted definition of the concept ofterrorism.Five years since the adoption of the MillenniumDeclaration  the social and economic situation inseveral parts of the globe continues to be characterizedby extreme poverty.As well-articulated mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report  “In larger freedom” (A/59/2005) poverty is not only about development; it is also amatter of security and respect for human rights  whichare fundamental to the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. For this reason  I agree with several previousspeakers that this issue in the outcome document oughtto be dealt with in greater detail. Thus  we lookforward to continuing our work in the relevant forums in particular in a strengthened Economic and SocialCouncil.The fight against HIV/AIDS  malaria tuberculosis and other illnesses constitutes anindispensable condition for peace  stability andinternational collective security. For this reason  weurge the international community to redouble its effortsin mobilizing the required resources for the preventionand treatment of these illnesses.Let me take this opportunity to express myGovernment’s appreciation to the United States forfunding and initiating a programme to fight malaria inAngola  as well as in Tanzania and Uganda.In my delegation’s opinion  in order to meet thechallenges facing the world  it is imperative that weproceed to the reform of the main organs of the UnitedNations  with a view to adapting them to the currentreality. We will remain active in the process of reformof the United Nations  including the Security Counciland the other primary bodies of our Organization.We share the opinion that the composition of theSecurity Council should properly reflect the presentday political reality. Enlarging the Security Councilwould render it more transparent and morerepresentative  with greater credibility and  inparticular  greater authority in its decisions.Nevertheless  we would like to underline that theenlargement of the Council is just one aspect of thereform that needs to be completed. We should notunderestimate other elements of Council reform thatwe consider no less important  such as the need to36improve and render more transparent its workingmethods.I am convinced that the results reached at theHigh-level Plenary Meeting during this session of theGeneral Assembly will stimulate the continuation ofthe debate on the process of the reform itself. This willcreate a platform that will reinforce the Organization’scommon vision and objectives: strengtheningcooperation and providing greater assurances thatinternational peace and stability can only be found in areinforced multilateralism."
"3",121,"ALB",60,2005,"Letme first convey  on behalf of the people and theGovernment of Albania  the most profound sentimentsof sympathy  friendship and solidarity to the people ofthe United States and to President Bush with respect tothe human suffering and the material damage caused byHurricane Katrina.I would like to wish Mr. Jan Eliasson everysuccess in carrying out his important mission. I takethis opportunity to assure him of the full cooperation ofmy country in accomplishing the undertakings ahead ofus. Let me also join others in thanking Mr. Jean Pingfor the dedication he demonstrated as president of theGeneral Assembly at its previous session and for theefforts he invested in the revitalization of ourOrganization.Albania aligns itself fully with the statementmade at the 9th plenary meeting by Mr. Jack Straw Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom  on behalf ofthe European Union.I am privileged to address the Assembly onbehalf of the new Albanian Government  which tookoffice following recent parliamentary elections. I willset out some of my country’s positions on issues ofconcern to us all and outline my Government’sstrategic priorities in the field of foreign policy.The fact that  just a few days ago  a large numberof heads of State and Government gathered at theUnited Nations to assess the progress made in theimplementation of the Millennium Development Goalsand to debate the reform of the Organization should betaken as a reaffirmation that multilateralism is adriving force in global policy. That also serves onceagain to confirm that we are living in a very complexand multidimensional environment that clearly requirescomprehensive  global and coherent reactions.The need for enhanced regional and globalcooperation has never been more pronounced. Albaniatherefore supports the outcome of the High-levelPlenary Meeting  which reaffirms our faith in theOrganization  the importance of the core values andprinciples of international cooperation  the globalpartnership for development  concerted actions tostrengthen collective security and peace  the fightagainst terrorism  promoting human rights and the ruleof law and the strengthening of the United Nations  inparticular its comprehensive reform. Albania believesthat  through concrete and speedy action  the sixtiethsession of the General Assembly will constitute animportant and meaningful step towards theimplementation of all the commitments to which I havereferred.Albania believes that the United Nations shouldbe further strengthened in order to continue to play adecisive role in the efforts of the internationalcommunity to create a safer  more stable andprosperous world. We would like to reiterate ourappreciation for the efforts of the Secretary-Generalwith regard to reforming the United Nations. Albaniashares his view that the United Nations needs to havethe legitimacy and flexibility to adapt itself to thecircumstances of a changing world. The SecurityCouncil clearly has enormous responsibility in thatregard. My country fully supports the reform of theSecurity Council. It should be noted  however  that weview Council reform from the standpoint of improvingits working methods and transparency and of adjustingand improving the decision-making system. We firmlybelieve that Members acting together have thenecessary power and capacity to achieve very broadconsensus on Council reform.34The roles of the General Assembly  the Economicand Social Council and the Secretary-General must notbe underestimated. Their potential has not yet beenfully explored. The success of the reform effort can beassured if it is coherent and aimed at the Organizationas a whole. Albania is encouraged by the outcomedocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting withregard to the strengthening of the United Nations. Wereaffirm our willingness to work with all delegations toachieve the broadest consensus possible on the mostimportant reform issues.Albania believes that the PeacebuildingCommission will be an essential and efficient tool fordeveloping more coherent  relevant and better fundedstrategies and for giving timely political attention to acountry making the transition from conflict tosustainable development. In that connection  thereform of the United Nations will better enable theOrganization to improve the work of the internationalcommunity and assist countries in the post-conflictphase.We believe that the exchange of views on theestablishment of the Human Rights Council will becompleted soon. An action-oriented Council with acredible membership will improve the quality ofUnited Nations efforts in the area of human rights.Moreover  we fully support the strengthening of theOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights including increasing its budget.Albania believes that the initiative to establish aDemocracy Fund is an essential component of reform.My country will make every effort to support the Fund.Like other friendly countries  we consider it aneffective mechanism to support new democracies strengthen civil society and establish institutionssupporting the rule of law.The numerous tragic events of recent years haveconfirmed that terrorism  which has taken thousands ofinnocent lives  is the most urgent threat facing theworld today. My country will remain committed tofighting this evil. We support Security Councilresolution 1624 (2005)  which was adopted during thehigh-level summit. We also join the solemn appeal tofinalize the comprehensive convention againstterrorism during the course of this session of theGeneral Assembly. We believe that acts of terrorismcarried out with weapons of mass destruction can haveunprecedented consequences for humankind.Arms control is a key element of my country’ssecurity policy. In that regard  I should like to point outour ongoing support for the further strengthening ofcrucial international disarmament and non-proliferationinstruments. Albania is therefore fully committed tocooperate on disarmament and non-proliferation issuesboth in its own region and beyond. To that end  wehave put in place robust measures at the national levelto prevent the illicit trafficking in arms on our territory.In addition  with regard to implementing commitmentson the control of small arms and light weapons  wehave amended our national legislation in order to bringit closer to that of the European Union in areas such aslicensing  strengthening import and export regimes andenforcement. Part of the Government’s programme inthis area has included the destruction of some 200 000small arms and light weapons that had been in thehands of civilians. Moreover  in cooperation withforeign donors  the Government has drafted aprogramme to destroy all chemical weapons materialson our territory  thereby contributing to thestrengthening of security in the region and beyond.Albania is continuing to demonstrate the growingmaturity of its democracy. The year 2005 is an electionyear in Albania. Last July’s parliamentary electionsand orderly transfer of power were tangibledevelopments that had a positive impact on thecountry’s future political  economic and socialdevelopment.Albania believes that good governance is a keyelement in improving the lives of all its citizens. Goodgovernance is also an essential precondition toguaranteeing sustainable economic growth anderadicating poverty. In that regard  we will worktirelessly to strengthen the rule of law  promotetransparency in the decision-making process andincrease the Government’s sense of responsibility toserve all citizens.With regard to the economy  the new AlbanianGovernment’s priorities in the coming years will be tofight corruption and the factors that encourage it promote free competition and relentlessly combatmonopolies.A set of measures is being contemplated toimprove the national education system. Among thosemeasures is the opening of universities to all who wantto pursue higher education.35In addition  for the first time in its history  awoman heads Albania’s National Assembly. This is astrong indication of Albania’s serious commitment togender equality.The new Government is committed to improvingthe country’s macroeconomic indicators. We aredetermined to develop social policies that guaranteegradual improvements in people’s living standards particularly for the most vulnerable. In order to achieveits programme’s goals  the Government will supportthe expansion and modernization of the financialsystem  while keeping inflation under control  in aneffort to improve the legal framework necessary foreconomic development.With regard to our close cooperation with theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund  weare determined to promote sound macroeconomic andinvestment policies that will guide the country towardssustainable development  encourage the private sectorand promote employment.I would also like to assure the Assembly that ourGovernment is fully committed to implementing theMillennium Development Goals. We share the beliefthat coordinating and harmonizing national and localdevelopment strategies  with wide-scale civil societyparticipation  private sector initiative  heightenedpublic awareness and the holding of public debates toidentify the most effective ways and means to achievethe Millennium Development Goals will lead to thedesired results  including in Albania.The Albanian Government is resolved to combatorganized crime  transnational crime  illegal traffickingand terrorism relentlessly by strengthening nationallegislation and law enforcement structures and byestablishing relevant implementation mechanisms andfully committing itself to regional cooperation on awider scale. That effort will serve to bring us closer toour friendly neighbours as well as to all Europeancountries. This is a common struggle.It should be recalled that my country has hadexcellent experience in coexistence among differentreligious communities. We are convinced thatstrengthening dialogue among cultures  civilizationsand religions is an important element in strengtheningpeaceful coexistence and good-neighbourly relations. Italso holds great potential for strengthening cooperationamong countries. In that connection  an internationalforum was held in Tirana in December 2004 under theauspices of the President of Albania and the Director-General of UNESCO. In addition to discussingimportant issues related to such a dialogue  thegathering also paved the way for further cooperation inthat regard.My country has decisively committed itself to thepath to Euro-Atlantic integration  with the clearpurpose of joining the European Union and NATO. Weview Euro-Atlantic integration as our country’s entryinto the zone of peace  stability and prosperityestablished in Western Europe over the course of manyyears. Joining that family will signal our society’sembrace of such values as economic and politicalfreedom  fundamental human rights and freedoms  theprimacy of law  social prosperity and solidarity. It willalso reflect that fact that we are making ourcontribution to that set of values.Albania is preparing for the closure ofnegotiations of the Stabilization and AssociationAgreement with the European Union that will lead toits signature. We are convinced that our country has theability to meet all the requirements of this veryrigorous process. Albanian society is firmly committedto carry out reform  which will contribute to ourintegration into the European Union. We believe thatthe reform process is  first and foremost  in the interestof the country and of strengthening the economy andimproving Albania’s image in the world.We view NATO as a guarantor of security in ourregion. By increasing cooperation with NATO we areaiming at membership soon. Albania’s participation inNATO peacekeeping operations in Bosnia andHerzegovina and Afghanistan constitutes a realcontribution to both regional and international peaceand security.Good-neighbourly relations and cooperation withthe countries of our region continue to be top prioritiesof our foreign policy. Our vision for a region ofstability and security  through fruitful bilateral andmultilateral cooperation  is sincere and is already quiteclear. Our philosophy regarding the development ofsuch relations is based on three basic principles:transparency  tolerance and dialogue. In that context we have intensified high-level political dialogue withall the countries of the region. We have expanded theframework for legal and institutional cooperation at thebilateral and multilateral levels in many areas ofcommon interest. That dialogue is becoming more36constant and sensible due to a spirit of mutualunderstanding and confidence.Through their growing participation inpeacekeeping missions in areas of conflict throughoutthe world  several countries of the region have beentransformed from consumers to worthy contributors tothe maintenance of international peace and security.With regard to positive developments andprogress in the region  Albania has consistently playeda positive  moderating and constructive role vis-à-visAlbania’s neighbouring countries by promoting multi-ethnic coexistence in an atmosphere of harmony andlasting peace. Albanian foreign policy holds thatdetermining the status of Kosovo is an important issue.There is no more time to lose. The status quo will notguarantee lasting peace in the region. We believe thatthe answer to Kosovo’s status should take into accountthe will of its people as democratically expressed andnot disregard the rights of minorities. In that regard conditional independence could allow the internationalcommunity to monitor the development of Kosovo’sinstitutions and society for a given period and  aboveall  would provide a guarantee for Serbs and otherminorities to live in their own homes in that country.We all believe that Kosovo’s future  as for all thecountries in the region  lies in European and Euro-Atlantic integration.We Albanians are confident that  in hisforthcoming report  Mr. Kai Aide  Special Envoy of theSecretary-General for Kosovo  will provide anobjective assessment of the standards achieved thus farin Kosovo in connection with the establishment of theinstitutions for the rule of law and a democraticenvironment that will open the way for negotiations onKosovo’s final status. The Contact Group on Kosovohas an important role to play in that process.In short  there have been some preliminarypositive results. But there is much work to be done byus all to encourage and sustain the dialogue betweenPristina and Belgrade. There are many issues todiscuss. With good will and the determination toachieve peace  we have much cause to optimistic."
"4",144,"AND",60,2005,"At the beginning of the third millennium faster means of travel that began in the nineteenthcentury with railroad technology are today hurtling usaround the globe at even faster speeds. Dramaticchanges are taking place at all levels and in all modesof communication. From the train  to the automobileand to the airplane  even in space travel  speed iserasing spatial barriers. The telegraph  the telephone the Internet  cell phones  video conferencing: speed isaltering the way we communicate with one another.In this new age  immensely significantdevelopments can take place as more quickly than themind can follow them. But as the philosopher PaulVirillio warns us  with every new technology comesthe potential for a new accident and with increasingspeed comes the threat of ever more horrendouscatastrophes. Natural disasters have become magnifiednot only by increases in population  but by the growingdangers of environmental pollution.Sixty years after the founding of the UnitedNations  we live in a faster world  where we have to beable to react to events almost immediately. We have toensure that even with the feeling of heightened riskthat we live with at the beginning of the twenty-firstcentury — whether this be due to natural phenomena advances in technology  the threat of terrorism or thefrittering away of resources — our will to act is not inany way diminished. The bar is set very high  but ourcapacity to act together as a whole can be just as great.Another period of technological innovation alsoaffected dramatic changes in the speed and mode ofcommunication - the printing press. Let us reflect fora moment about the effects of those changes and whatwe might learn from them. The printing press fostereda rapid exchange of information that was readilyavailable to large numbers of people and could not becensored or controlled  although some institutions triedvery hard to enact such controls. Out of this explosionof information came the glory of a scientific revolutionbut also the sixteenth-century wars of religion andEurope’s first world war  the Thirty Years War of thefirst half of the seventeenth century. The promise ofeventual mastery over the natural world was coupledwith violent attempts to dominate the minds and soulsof man.In many ways  our own information revolutionhas had a similar effect on developments. On the onehand  we have reason to hope that the problems facingthe world can be solved by technology; on the otherhand  technology has contributed to the rise ofextremism and provided the means to unleash violenceof hitherto unknown proportions.The radical enlightenment  which first began inthe Netherlands  a small country but one known for itstolerance and liberty of creative thought  offered newsolutions to the turmoil and sectarian violence of thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It developed amode of critique that could be separated from religioustruth  and  for the first time in the history of the West  afully modern ethical system. What forms might aradical twenty-first century enlightenment take? Iwould rather hope that we will see a new sense of22human values  a recognition that we are united not onlyby our presence in a shrinking world but as members ofthe human race.We are fully aware that even as this explosion intechnology seems to link all countries in the embraceof a globalized media culture  it feeds oldparochialisms  nationalism and ethnic strife. The gapbetween rich and poor  the have and have-notcountries  seems ever wider  even as ourinterconnectedness grows in trade and in labour. Butwith visions of first-world excess beamed into everycomer of the globe  can anyone be surprised that angertowards the West increases? Poverty  discrimination war  hunger and disease — this is the daily lot for agreat part of humanity. We see the images every day.We cannot ignore nor can we fear these realities. Wehave to face them with real development policiescoupled with good governance and a just system fortrade and dialogue. The Millennium DevelopmentGoals are our collective responsibility.The legacy of the Renaissance nation Stateremains a powerful concept. Our love for ourrespective countries and all that this represents to us isa defining aspect of our identities. So how is it possibleto overcome the fundamental paradox of thisOrganization — to link the pride of our nationalstatehood  which is the source of our material  culturaland ethnic differences  to the idea of unity  of being“united”.In part  the answer seems to lie in the potentialfor rebalancing the global economy  but it also requiresa reawakening of those dulled sensibilities thatseparate rich from poor  the advantaged from thedisadvantaged  the free from the oppressed. TheMillennium Declaration was a necessary step forward and the current tensions over reform should not distractthis body from its ultimate mission.Whether we are speeding towards challenges thatwill take the form of natural or man-made catastrophes we can be assured that their effects will no longer becontained within national borders. We must prepare torespond to them with a strength and resolve that alsoknows no bounds.Before  I spoke of a small country  theNetherlands  and of its history. Andorra is also a smallcountry that believes in tolerance and respect for ourfellow man. Our stable relations with our neighbours Andorra’s tradition as a safe haven during Europeanwars and conflicts  our parliamentary tradition thatstretches back to 1419 and our geopolitical realities  allmake us believe in and defend the virtues and values ofdialogue  pacifism and development  which are at onewith those of the United Nations.In twelve years of international life  my countryhas adopted some 130 international conventions andhas stated its firm belief in international law  as in thecreation of the International Criminal Court. We willcontinue in this task  reaffirming our commitment tomultilateralism  and by sending to Parliament forratification the conventions on terrorism and humanrights. We also give our support to the creation of aCouncil of Human Rights  and we will follow closelythe progress made on a new convention in the struggleagainst terrorism.The United Nations represents a legacy from aperiod of conflict which culminated in the SecondWorld War  the Cold War  and the nuclear stalematethat followed. While we recognize its imperfections we must not forget to acknowledge the wisdom of itsguiding principles: peace between all nations  universalhuman rights  and the development of states.We live in a time when the power of a singlenation is fast becoming an historical illusion. Let uswork towards a new enlightenment  the unity of theUnited Nations. It is time to work together for theUnited Nations."
"5",189,"ARE",60,2005,"It is my pleasure to take this opportunity tocongratulate you on your election to the Presidency ofthis session  which coincides with the sixtiethanniversary of the United Nations. We hope that thisimportant session will provide a historic opportunity toreview and evaluate the achievements of thisOrganization and to formulate a political anddevelopment vision on strengthening our commonaction and our ability to maintain international peaceand security and achieve sustainable development.The United Arab Emirates welcomes theOutcome Document of the High-level Plenary Meetingand considers it a positive step towards achieving theMDGs  especially those related to the four main fields namely development  peace and collective security human rights  rule of law and the strengthening of theUnited Nations. At the same time  we hope that ourconsultations on other unsolved issues will continue inorder to reach an international consensus.In that context  we wish to reaffirm our positioncalling for the reform of the United Nations  includingthe increase of permanent and non-permanentmembership of the Security Council  based on a systemof equitable geographical distribution that ensures thetransparency of the Council’s working methods.We emphasize the importance of reinforcinginternational commitment to the principles ofinternational and humanitarian law and respect for thesovereignty of States  including their cultural andreligious diversity and traditions. We also underline theneed to respect the resolutions and recommendations ofinternational legitimacy issued by world summits including the Millennium Declaration.We affirm that the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury  including poverty  illiteracy  epidemics environmental degradation  global terrorism  organizedcrime and the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  are by nature transnational and pose gravethreats to all humanity. Therefore  while we supportedthe establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission which will assist countries recovering from civil andregional wars  we call for the utilization of our humancultures and beliefs in joint efforts to address suchchallenges  including the holding of an internationalconference on combating terrorism and its causes. Sucha conference must provide a clear definition ofterrorism  based on the principles of the United NationsCharter and international law and norms  and mustdistinguish between terrorism and the legitimate25struggle of peoples against foreign occupation. At thesame time  we reaffirm our support for the proposal ofthe brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to establish aninternational centre to combat terrorism.Firmly convinced of the importance of adoptingpeaceful solutions in resolving disputes and issues offoreign occupation  particularly in the Middle East andthe Arab Gulf region  the United Arab Emirates callsupon the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond to itspeaceful initiatives aimed at resolving the issue ofIran’s occupation of the three islands of the UnitedArab Emirates — Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and AbuMusa — through bilateral negotiations or by referral tothe International Court of Justice.In that context  we reaffirm that all actions takenby Iran since its illegal occupation of the three islandsin 1971 are null and void  because they contradict theUnited Nations Charter  international law  theprinciples of good neighbourliness and the peacefulcoexistence of nations and confidence-buildingmeasures. In the light of the impact of that importantand delicate issue on the security and the stability ofthe Arab Gulf region and on the entire world  theUnited Arab Emirates  along with other countries ofthe Gulf Cooperation Council  looks forward to theIranian Government’s review of its policy in thatregard. We also hope that Iran will take a transparentand objective approach in its response to the repeatedpeaceful initiatives of the countries of the region which call for the end of Iran’s occupation of the threeislands belonging to the United Arab Emirates and thecreation of a positive regional environment conduciveto the strengthening of cooperation  goodneighbourliness and mutual advantage among theregion’s countries and to prosperity and stability for itspeoples.We are hopeful that the political transitionprocess in Iraq will be completed and  in that respect we renew our support for all efforts made by the IraqiGovernment to strengthen political dialogue among thevarious Iraqi factions  achieve national reconciliationand rebuild its national institutions so that Iraq canmaintain its unity  territorial sovereignty  independenceand stability  and can play its natural role in the regionand the world.The United Arab Emirates welcomes Israel’swithdrawal from the Gaza Strip and parts of thenorthern West Bank and hopes that the internationalcommunity will urge Israel to complete its withdrawalfrom the Arab and Palestinian territories occupiedsince 1967  including the Syrian Golan and theLebanese Shaba’a farms  dismantle the separation walland discontinue its settlement plans and activities  inaccordance with the resolutions of internationallegitimacy  the Arab peace initiative based on the land-for-peace principle  and the Quartet’s road map.Furthermore  the international community muststrengthen its support of the Palestinian Authority andhelp it rebuild its national institutions and exploit itsnatural and economic resources.We also demand that Israel accede to the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons andsubmit its nuclear facilities to the supervision of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency  in accordancewith the relevant United Nations resolutions calling forthe establishment of a zone free of weapons of massdestruction  including nuclear weapons  in the MiddleEast and the Arab Gulf region.In spite of the progress made in science andinformation technology  the international communitycontinues to face a growing economic gap between theNorth and the South. Therefore  we call for furtherinternational efforts to address that imbalance including the greater participation of developingcountries in decision-making in economic and tradematters  and for the commitment of industrializedStates to continue their support for developmentprogrammes in the developing countries in order tocreate a fair and just international economicenvironment in which all peoples enjoy the benefits ofprosperity  well-being and development.The United Arab Emirates has developedhumanitarian and financial assistance programmes toassist developing countries and countries affected byconflicts  civil and regional wars and natural disasters.That assistance exceeds the percentage recommendedby international conferences on development and theMillennium Development Goals. In that context  theUnited Arab Emirates has adopted multifaceteddevelopment policies and plans to keep pace withinternational economic and development changes.Those policies include human resources development the opening of the country’s markets to foreign tradeand the enhancement of the private sector’s role innational development.26In conclusion  we hope that our deliberations atthis session will result in a positive outcome thatstrengthens our joint efforts to realize our peoples’hope and ambition to live in a world in which security stability  peace  freedom and justice prevail."
"6",236,"ARG",60,2005,"I wishto congratulate you  Sir  on your election to presideover the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. I amconvinced that your talent will enable us to take usefuldecisions. You can count on the full cooperation of mydelegation. I also thank the Secretary-General for hisefforts to renew the Organization and his work onbehalf of the international community.This general debate is being held after the summitto review the implementation of the Millennium Goals in which many heads of State or Governmentparticipated  including the President of my country.The work accomplished by the President at thatMeeting will help to overcome the difficulties facingthe Organization.For the Argentine Republic  respect for the ruleof law is an essential premise. We believe thatdemocracy is a universal value that is not the heritageof any country or region in particular. Day after day we strive to improve its quality and to ensure the ruleof law and the impartiality and independence of ourjudiciary.Mr. Singh (India)  Vice-President took the Chair.Respect for human rights  whose protectivenorms form part of our Constitution  is another of ourconcerns. In my country  promoting and protectinghuman rights is a State policy that is part of ourdemocratic identity as a nation and therefore is one ofthe main underpinnings of our foreign policy.Defending the right to life and the right to dignityof men and women throughout the world does notallow half-hearted words or half-hearted solutions.That is due to the importance that human rights haveacquired in the international arena as a factor in thepreservation of peace  development and democracy  aswell as in the cruel historic circumstances throughwhich my country had to struggle.We can never devote too much energy topromoting and protecting the human rights of allpeoples of the world. Intolerance  censorship  tortureand cruelty  even when they are presented as excessescommitted in the name of beliefs  deny the validity ofthe forum in which we are now speaking  and they willcontinue to do so as long as they exist.In the context of its lasting commitment topolicies for social inclusion  my country  a few daysago  adopted a national plan against discrimination. Itunconditionally supports the progress of thenegotiations currently taking place in the Organizationto achieve a comprehensive convention for people withdisabilities and hopes that work on that convention willbe completed in the course of the coming year.International solidarity can do a great deal forthose deprived of their fundamental rights andfreedoms  especially as nobody expects such tormentsto come upon them. That is why  from the start of thediscussions on United Nations reform  we have taken avery active stance to strengthen and perfect theuniversal system for the protection of human rights making sure that those rights occupy the centralposition that is their rightful place.There are few things in which men have notbelieved — as few as those things they did not expect.For that reason  in a country whose citizens wereallowed to think that impunity is possible  those thatsurvived must work to prevent history from beingrepeated.We therefore support the creation of a HumanRights Council as an essential organ of the UnitedNations and to give the issue of human rights the sameimportance as that attached to development andsecurity. During the ongoing negotiations  Argentinawill work decisively to establish an organ that cancarry out vigorous and effective action to promote andprotect human rights in all the world.Strengthening global justice is necessary to put astop to massive human rights violations  genocide andcrimes against humanity. Argentina is involved in the27fight against impunity for those crimes andunconditionally supports the International CriminalCourt.We welcome the adoption of Security Councilresolution 1593 (2005)  which refers the situation ofDarfur to the Prosecutor of the International CriminalCourt. That resolution represents a very important stepin the strengthening of the institutions establishedunder the Rome Statute. It is a historical precedentlinked to the achievement of two main goals of theUnited Nations: peace and basic rights.Argentina  which in its past suffered systematicviolations of human rights characterized by torture forced disappearances and summary executions of itscitizens  has taken decisive steps through its domesticlegislation to put an end to impunity. Our SupremeCourt recently ruled that the general amnesty lawsentitled “Punto Final” and “Obediencia debida” wereunconstitutional and that they were an obstacle toattaining a postponed but necessary justice. Thus  wejoin the efforts to ensure that those accountable forcrimes against humanity are tried and punished.As the President of Argentina stated during therecent summit  Argentina unequivocally condemnsterrorism in all its forms and manifestations  regardlessof the causes it invokes. Nothing can justifyindiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians andnon-combatants. We are strongly committed to fightingthat grave threat to international peace and security.Our response to terrorism must be ethical andmorally valid  and must therefore be carried out in fullrespect of the United Nations Charter  the rule of law international law  human rights  refugee law andhumanitarian law.Given that we have to protect others from fear we must act in accordance with the principles oflegitimacy and proportionality and with the support ofinternational public opinion.Argentina  the current Chair of the SecurityCouncil’s 1267 (1999) Committee  responsible formonitoring implementation of the sanctions againstmembers of the terrorist group Al-Qaida and theTaliban  believes that the United Nations has a centralrole to play in the coordinating the efforts and thedevelopment of international mechanisms. We mustsupport those endeavours  particularly through thestrict and full implementation of Security Councilresolutions.This year  my country ratified the 1999International Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism. With that ratification  itbecame a State party to the 12 internationalconventions to combat terrorism. And we have justsigned the International Convention for theSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.In spite of the efforts made  there has been anincrease in the number of attacks. That requires acareful review and assessment of the objectives methods and approaches employed  as well as animportant effort by the international community tobring conflicts to an end soon  eliminate aggressiveinequalities and achieve a fairer  more rational world.There has recently been some importantconceptual progress towards the completion of aninternational convention on terrorism. We hope thatthis instrument can soon be adopted.My country — which suffered two very seriousattacks  against the Israeli embassy in 1992 and againstthe Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) inBuenos Aires in 1994 — is determined to shed light onthose heinous and unjustifiable criminal acts.Identifying and punishing the culprits is our deeply feltduty to the innocent victims and their families. It isalso the desire of the Argentine people.The United Nations is undergoing a reformprocess that must be transparent  thorough andadequate  and it must answer the urgent and undeniabledemands of our peoples. All main organs of the UnitedNations should be thoroughly improved. The GeneralAssembly  the principal deliberative and decision-taking authority  must find a way to ensure that itsvoice is heard throughout the world. The Economic andSocial Council also needs to be thoroughly rethoughtand restructured to make it more effective.A vast majority has called for enhancing thetransparency and the effectiveness of the SecurityCouncil. As part of the Uniting for Consensusmovement  Argentina will work for a Security Councilthat includes new members only within the category ofnon-permanent members  because we believe that weshould not create new privileges contrary to thedemocratic spirit that should reign in the UnitedNations. Council members should be accountable for28their actions  and that can be achieved through periodicelections.For its part  the Secretariat must continue itsprocess of professionalization and universalization tobetter ensure its accountability and effectiveness.Peacekeeping operations are among the mosteffective tools of the United Nations to bring peace andsecurity to troubled peoples. Argentina is stronglycommitted to these operations  in which it hasparticipated since 1958. Currently  we are contributingto eight of them.In particular  I would highlight efforts beingmade in Haiti in the search for a peaceful and lastingsolution to Haiti’s serious challenges. We have longknown that the response to crisis does not end with theestablishment of a peacekeeping operation. Because ofthis  we have established complex operations able topromote stable solutions in all fields: namely security;the rule of law; justice; institution-building;disarmament  demobilization and reintegration; socialand economic development; human rights; anddemocracy.That is why we stress the importance ofestablishing a Peacebuilding Commission.Argentina supports the goals established at theMillennium Summit and at Johannesburg andMonterrey. Recent progress in development financingshows that while developing countries have madesignificant efforts to reform and streamline theireconomies  these efforts have not been accompanied bymeasures on the part of developed countries to fulfilthe commitments adopted at those conferences.Once again  we urge developed countries to allot0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product fordevelopment assistance  to open their markets and todo away with subsidies. We support the MonterreyConsensus provisions on reform of the internationalfinancial system to adapt the system to the newchallenges posed by the fulfilment of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.We believe in the need to study and negotiate thecreation of new international financial instruments thatwill prove more efficient in the ongoing fight againsthunger and poverty.I turn now to two topics that are of utmostimportance to Argentina: first  the international tradesituation. As the summit outcome document that wehave adopted (resolution 60/1) states  internationaltrade is a fundamental tool for economic and socialdevelopment. It is  therefore  imperative that weestablish fair  equitable and rule-based internationaltrade that is inclusive and gives priority todevelopment. The ongoing World Trade Organization(WTO) negotiations in the context of the Dohadevelopment round are of key importance. It isessential for the WTO to promote a fair internationaltrade system. Developed countries must eliminateprotectionist measures in the form of subsidies non-tariff barriers and arbitrary standards  whichdistort and limit commercial exchanges  especially inthe agricultural sector.The sixth WTO Ministerial Conference  to beheld in Hong Kong  is drawing near  and there is still agreat deal to be done. We hope that it will enable us toincrease the indirect benefits to be gained throughgrowing participation by developing countries ininternational trade.Secondly  we must also deal with the question ofexternal debt. International bodies must adopteffective  broad  equitable and lasting solutions to theproblem of the debt of developing countries. Theconcept of sustainability of external debt must beredefined  bearing in mind the primary responsibilityof the State to maintain and stimulate development insectors such as health  education and promotion ofemployment. It is illogical to transform developingcountries into relatively less-developed countries sothat when the desperate moment arrives  the debtcancellation process can begin.In conclusion  I also wish to refer here to thequestion of the Malvinas Islands. Recovery of the fullexercise of sovereignty over the Malvinas  SouthGeorgia and South Sandwich Islands and thesurrounding maritime areas is among the nationalinterests that are an essential component of Argentina’sidentity as a democratic nation. All Argentines arestrongly committed to the peaceful settlement of thisdispute; this commitment is a priority of my country’sforeign policy and is enshrined in our Constitution.Argentina has repeatedly stated its willingness toresume negotiations on sovereignty  as took placebetween 1966 and 1982.I wish to conclude by reiterating that we have anopportunity to renew this Organization so that it is29better equipped to meet the numerous demands ofhumanity. Everything we can achieve today will resultin benefits for future generations. We shall cooperatewith other United Nations Members to that end withdue modesty  as any party expecting the same level ofcommitment from others would cooperate."
"7",261,"ARM",60,2005,"Let me first welcomeyou  Sir  to your position. I know we will enjoyworking with you  given our past experience. Let mealso express our appreciation to the outgoing Presidentfor the leadership that he provided during the previoussession.When the Millennium Summit was held in 2000 in another New York and another era and beforeunspeakable events overtook our agenda  the lack ofuniversal economic development was the supremechallenge and security concern that we had. That iswhy the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) werecreated. It took the commitment and firm belief ofalmost 200 of our world leaders to come up withsimple  obvious  straightforward objectives  which Ithink can be best summed up by Amartya Sen’seloquent formulation  “Development as freedom”. Fiveyears later  I think these goals are still relevant andthey are no less imperative. Pretending that anythingless would do is  I think  disingenuous  dangerous andunfair.If  today  our focus is on global security  and weall clearly understand and see that the path to securitypasses through development  then we should recallEleanor Roosevelt  who 60 years ago  working on theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  stated thatmen in need were not free. Indeed  only with therealization of these Goals can we enable men to live ingreater freedom.In Armenia  where our resources are very limitedbut the will of people is very strong  we have beenexperiencing good economic growth. In the past fouror five years  we have indeed seen double-digiteconomic growth  and we understand that our biggestchallenge today is to translate that high economicgrowth into progress in human development. Each yearin Armenia we look forward to the publication of theHuman Development Report because we see it as a sortof report card that shows how our country is doing. Inthe past four or five years we have been making steadyprogress. This year we placed eighty-third  ahead of allof our neighbours.While we should not underestimate this progress on the other hand  we do not want to exaggerate it. Wehave to look at this index  at its promise  and see whatproblems we facing that we need to address and whatgaps need to be filled.22First  we have to accelerate our efforts to reducethe level of poverty in our country. Societies are judgedby the way they treat their most vulnerable. InArmenia  the poor are in the rural areas and we have tomake sure that economic development can trickle outto our rural areas from the cities. For us  economicdevelopment is comprehensive rural development. It isour plan to identify those areas that can provideopportunity for rural people so that they can developand unleash their capacity for production. Just as withthe MDGs  there must be a partnership between richand poor. In our case  we are trying to create such apartnership so that we reduce the numbers of poor inour country more rapidly.Secondly  we have to turn democracy into a toolfor development. Democracy means not only elections.Democracy and democratic institutions are not simplyends for their own sake. They have to provide  andthey will provide  a better environment for politicaland economic development. We think we need tocreate transparent  solid  open institutions so that wecan limit the action of the elite  and create a levelplaying field for the entire population.We are pleased with the ranking that we haveachieved. But we are satisfied only because we knowwe have achieved this against all odds: against ourgeography  against our history and against attempts inour region to isolate Armenia.Armenia is a small  landlocked country. We donot have the natural resources our neighbours have. Ithas become customary to say that our greatest naturalresource is our population  and indeed it is. But let mesay that  if we had the oil resources  we would haveused those revenues to double our education budget because we understand that education is development.Education creates dreams for our youth and providesthe means to achieve them. If we had the oil revenues we would double our social security budget  becausewe clearly see that there is a gap between the dreams ofour people and the prospects of achieving them. If wehad the oil revenues  we would double our efforts inthe area of environmental protection  because that isthe best investment a society can make.But one thing we would not do is to double ourmilitary budget. We will not create imaginary outsideenemies to justify our own inaction and failures. Wewill not pretend that there are simplistic  fanaticalsolutions to complicated social and economicproblems. In other words  we think the military optionis not available as a tool in domestic and foreignpolicy.When it comes to regional conflicts  advocatingmilitary solutions is not only unrealistic but is also aclear manifestation of a patent lack of understanding ofdemocracy  rule of law and human rights. The foundersof this institution  the United Nations  clearly indicatedand knew that security  development and human rightsgo hand in hand.But self-determination is a human right and thepeople of Nagorny Karabakh have aspired to it  foughtfor it and earned it. They had to face the aggression ofa Government they did not choose  but they fought forself-determination and they earned it. It was a fightthat was not of their choosing and the right they foughtfor was neither abstract nor excessive. What they wantis what we all want  the right to live on their own land in their own homes  in dignity  safety and security.The people of Karabakh have achieved that  andsubsequently they have demonstrated to the world thatthey can sustain their de facto independence  that theycan rule themselves  create democratic institutions andconduct elections.Countries like mine come to such gatherings andmeetings with huge expectations  because we want tocontribute  to participate and to be involved in the giveand take. But  if you think that because I am theMinister for Foreign Affairs of what is obviously asmall country  and frankly  an imperfect one  I do nothave the right to expound on our common future  allowme for a moment to speak  not as a foreign minister but as a citizen of the world.The prospect of United Nations reform is only thebeginning of achieving the promise of a worldOrganization that would better resemble the realities ofthe current world. If we cannot find common ground  ifwe cannot agree to reform this institution today ortomorrow or next week or this year  I believe that oneday we will have to do it. We cannot simply go onpretending that we do not know our history. We cannotgo on pretending that the world has not changed. Wecannot go on pretending that we do not understand thatthere are new realities. It is not 1945 any longer.Still  it is very encouraging that the principlesenshrined in the United Nations Charter — writtenthree generations ago — remain valid  relevant and23significant today. That is because the spirit of SanFrancisco in 1945  and the global Charter that wasforged there  were revolutionary. The Charter affirmedthe obligation and accountability of one generation toanother  of one State to another other  and that together States can and must create a safer world. The formulathat was worked out then to achieve those goalsworked.Today  we need to rework that formula reaffirming  first and foremost  our responsibility andaccountability to our citizens and Governments  theresponsibility of international institutions to theirmembers and of States to each other.We need to democratize international relationsand international institutions. We need fair  earnedrepresentation around the decision-making table.Earned representation: that is  countries that arecommitted to democracy  human rights and the rule oflaw should have the right to sit on the Human RightsCouncil; countries that are serious about social andeconomic development should occupy seats on theEconomic and Social Council; and countries that arecommitted to world peace and security  that are seriousabout the dignity of the world community  shouldassume a leadership role in the world community.Those are not ambitious goals. It is only naturalthat our national interests will differ. That is why theUnited Nations must step in to fill the gap  enabling usto work together in exchange for commitment andaction.It all boils down to our accountability to ourchildren. What will we say to our children if we do notachieve the Millennium Development Goals in the nextdecade  when we are living in an era that has witnessedthe creation of huge wealth in the world economy  butwhere half of the world’s population still lives inpoverty  far from benefiting from the fruit of thatgrowth? What if we  in our region  miss theopportunity to make peace and put war  itsconsequences and its legacy  behind us? How  then  arewe going to be able to look our children in the face?What if we reject that chance to learn from our past  tocome to terms with our history  if we refuse to take ourcommon and joint responsibility to intervene andprevent conflict  letting Governments time and againcommit torture  ethnic cleansing and genocide againsttheir own populations? What will we then tell ourchildren?When the United Nations was created 60 yearsago  it gave the people of the world hope and faith intheir leaders  in their future and in the lives of theirchildren. Today  having witnessed the huge calamitiesand catastrophes  both man-made and natural  whichhave occurred recently  there is a clear need to restorethe faith of the peoples of the world.Looking at the damage caused by last year’sAsian tsunami and the recent Hurricane Katrina looking at the violence that is being perpetrated inDarfur and the carnage that we witnessed in London we are questioning ourselves  our neighbours and ourassumptions. The answer must be united momentum united effort  united resources and united action bynations united. The United Nations can still be thatanswer."
"8",294,"ATG",60,2005,"This is thefirst time that a representative from the island ofBarbuda has had the honour to address the GeneralAssembly. For my country  the nation of Antigua andBarbuda - and  more important  for my fellowBarbudans - this is indeed a historic and significantmilestone.The Government and the people of Antigua andBarbuda have full confidence in the multilateralsystem  and in the United Nations as the primaryinstrument of multilateralism. Further  we believe thatonly through cooperation at the international level canmicro-States like Antigua and Barbuda begin toaddress the global threats and challenges thatjeopardize our existence  our way of life and our abilityto make progress.Antigua and Barbuda attaches great importance tothe work of the United Nations and to the outcome ofthe collective decisions of the family of nations. Welook forward to safeguards for small developing Statesin all stages of multilateral processes  and specificallyin the outcome document of the 2005 world summit(resolution 60/1).Taking stock of the achievement of the objectivesof the outcome of major United Nations conferencesand summits is a task we approach with trepidation.15Antigua and Barbuda is attempting to achieve andsustain a decent standard of living for our people andfor future generations. Our progress report is a mixedone  tinged with both hope and frustration. We arehopeful because we have achieved a lot with ourmeagre resources. In the face of severe economichardship  we have managed to achieve a literacy rate ofover 90 per cent among young people aged 15 to 25years. Access to primary and secondary education ismandatory and is provided free of cost by theGovernment to all students aged 5 to 16. All publicschool students are provided with school uniforms andthe required textbooks free of cost. To accommodateour expanding student population  only this week wecommissioned a new school on my island of Barbuda.Poor people need access to the necessaryresources so that they can take charge of their owndevelopment. That is why the Barbudan people areextremely proud of what we consider to be a veryprogressive land policy for the ownership of land onour island. The Barbuda Lands Act  which is scheduledto be introduced in Parliament shortly  stipulates thatall land on Barbuda be owned in common by theBarbudan people.In the area of health care  we in Antigua andBarbuda have a national medical benefits programmethat provides low-cost access to health-care servicesand prescription drugs. Our child mortality rate isamong the lowest in developing countries  and ournutrition level for children aged 5 years and under isamong the highest.The promotion of gender equality and theempowerment of women has been a priority area forAntigua and Barbuda. We signed and ratified theConvention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination Against Women  and are currentlyworking on the ratification of the Convention'sOptional Protocol. With regard to the MillenniumDevelopment Goal pertaining to the empowerment ofwomen  Antigua and Barbuda has made noteworthystrides. Our first woman was elected to Parliament inthe last general elections. Our Speaker of Parliamentand our President of the Senate are women  and thereare two women in our Cabinet. Concerted efforts havebeen made to promote women's political participationat all levels.In spite of such progress  however  we continueto experience a high level of frustration with regard todevelopment. That is because the progress we havemade thus far is at risk of being wiped away. As amiddle-income small island developing State  we arecontinually handed the sharp edge of the sword to holdwhen it comes to a number of issues of internationaldevelopment. It is as if we were being punished by theinternational community for having achieved somemeasure of progress with very meagre resources anddespite severe external challenges.The Monterrey Consensus represents a pactbetween developed and developing countries  theobjective of which is the scaling up of financing fordevelopment. Yet there is nothing in the MonterreyConsensus that so-called middle-income countries canbenefit from. We have fulfilled the responsibilitiesaccorded to Governments of developing countries asstipulated in the Monterrey Consensus. We continue togo beyond those responsibilities to consolidate theprinciples of accountability  transparency and goodgovernance in laws we introduced in Parliament in theseventh month of the first term of the incumbentGovernment of Antigua and Barbuda.All of that took place against a backdrop of adeclining trend in the flow of official developmentassistance (ODA) to the Caribbean region. It isnecessary for international agreements on financing fordevelopment  such as the Monterrey Consensus  toinclude all developing countries  and not sideline thosethat have achieved some measure of progress. Ourfrustration with the Monterrey Consensus  and withfinancing for development in general  would not be soacute were it not been for the brutal challenges we facein other areas that are potential engines for economicgrowth and development.We have been forced to ask ourselves if a pro-development trade regime is something theinternational community really wants. Our neighboursin the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) have beendragged through brutal trade battles  struggling to keepalive their agricultural sector  namely  the banana andsugar industries. The Caribbean Community has foryears been lamenting the importance of those twosectors to the livelihood of our people. A pro-development trade regime would not amputate the feetof such small vulnerable players and leave them tohaemorrhage. And that is exactly what has transpiredwith regard to our banana- and sugar-producingCARICOM neighbours.16As if that were not enough  we in Antigua andBarbuda now find ourselves under attack in yet anothersector. Last week  during the 2005 world summit  thePrime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda (seeA/60/PV.4) spoke of the need for us to seek theintervention of the World Trade Organization in thedispute with the United States over Internet gaming.With trade in agriculture proving continually difficultfor developing States in general  and for small islandStates in particular  the services sector is just about theonly option we currently have for diversification. ForAntigua and Barbuda  the tourism sector has been goodto us  but it is extremely volatile  and our high levels ofenvironmental and economic vulnerability necessitatestrategically identifying other options for economicgrowth and development. One such option is Internetgaming. But due to the unfair trade practices of highlydeveloped countries  notably the United States  we arefinding it increasingly difficult to realize developmentbenefits from Internet gaming.In addition to that  the principle of special anddifferential treatment for countries with special needs such as small island developing States  is underperpetual assault by highly developed countries. Aftercareful consideration and evaluation  we are forced toconclude that there is nothing tangible for smalldeveloping States in the Monterrey Consensus. We arelosing the battle on the issue of trade  and so weattempt to hitch our proverbial wagon to foreign directinvestment as a means of stimulating economic growthand development. But once again  our efforts meet withfrustration. Why? Because of unsustainable debt.Our experience has shown that highly indebtedcountries find it extremely difficult to attract privateinternational finance. The international communitynow realizes the importance of debt reduction and debtforgiveness to development. We urge that the situationof heavily indebted middle-income countries be givenserious attention by the international community. Ifmore is not done to address the debt problem ofmiddle-income countries  we risk reversing ourdevelopment gains. Instead of a reduction  the netresult may actually be increasing levels of poverty.Antigua and Barbuda fully supports all efforts toachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).With regard to environmental sustainability  smallislands like Antigua and Barbuda face the challenge ofvery limited land space and fragile ecosystems  and arehighly vulnerable to natural disasters and the effects ofclimate change. Compounding those challenges is ourheavy dependence on the natural environment tosupport our tourism product  which accounts for almost80 per cent of our gross national income. Two thirds ofthe island of Barbuda is merely a few feet above sealevel. Threats to our natural environment are threats toour very way of life and existence. We thereforewelcome paragraphs 51 to 53 in the 2005 worldsummit outcome document on the issue of climatechange.The devastation wrought by the increasedintensity of hurricanes has set us back years  evendecades  on the development scale. Antigua andBarbuda stresses the need for policies to mitigate theeffects of hurricanes and other natural disasters onsmall developing States  as well as the establishment ofan effective system of long-term support for countriesrecovering from disasters.International drug trafficking has major securityimplications for our islands. Drug traffickers often useour shores and surrounding waters as trans-shipmentpoints for their illegal cargo  resulting in an increase inthe criminal element within our fragile societies. Thosecriminals operate within very sophisticated networksthat are beyond the reach and capacity of ourresources. It is a situation that puts the security of theentire region at risk. This is one area that begs forgreater international attention.Antigua and Barbuda is in agreement with manyof the recommendations to strengthen the UnitedNations  as contained in the outcome document of the2005 world summit. We support those reformproposals  the objective of which is to make the UnitedNations more democratic  increase its legitimacy andenhance its work.At a time when multilateralism is coming underattack  we  as small developing States  remain evermindful of the need for the United Nations. We shareequally in the quest for peace and security and areheartened by the growing recognition that there can beno peace and security without development. We call forfurther and unambiguous acknowledgement of thesecurity-development nexus and for the economicdevelopment of all countries to be accorded equalpriority as international peace and security."
"9",341,"AUS",60,2005,"Australia is a foundingMember of the United Nations  and we have longsupported this Organization’s important role in worldaffairs. The United Nations has many achievements tocelebrate in its sixtieth year. Equally  the sixtiethanniversary places the shortcomings and indeed thefailings of the United Nations under a microscope forall to see.In approaching this occasion  the United Nationsand its Members have been presented with a challenge:to find practical and workable ways to bring greatersecurity and prosperity to the people of the worldthrough a reformed United Nations system. This hasnot been easy. The reform agenda is simultaneouslyvast and urgent  with agreement on approachesdifficult — at times impossible — to achieve  as therecent summit process made clear.Australia welcomes the summit’s progress insome important areas  particularly the agreement toestablish a Peacebuilding Commission to assist fragileStates  a field of endeavour where Australia has longbeen active in its own region  as I have outlined inprevious addresses to the General Assembly. We alsowelcome the fact that States have agreed for the firsttime that the international community  through theUnited Nations  has the responsibility to act to protectpopulations from gross and systematic violations ofhuman rights.We also welcome the call for early conclusion ofa comprehensive terrorism convention and early entryinto force of the International Convention for theSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.We are pleased that  on development  the SummitOutcome (resolution 60/1) recognizes what alreadyunderpins Australia’s approach to developmentassistance: that good governance  sound economicpolicies  anti-corruption measures and tradeliberalization are critical elements in fighting povertyand promoting economies and stable communities.Australia has a proud record of assistance in theseareas  further underscored by our announcement lastweek of an increase in Australia’s overseas aidallocation to about 4 billion Australian dollars by2010 — a doubling of aid from 2004 levels — as wellas generous contributions of 10 million Australiandollars to the Democracy Fund and 3 million to thePeacebuilding Fund over three years.As a nation that strongly supports an ambitiousoutcome of the Doha round of multilateral tradenegotiations and recognizes the crucial importance ofthis to developing countries  Australia also welcomesthe pledge and challenge put forward by PresidentBush a week ago (see A/60/PV.2): that the UnitedStates is ready to eliminate all tariffs  subsidies andother barriers if other nations do the same.But alongside these welcome outcomes  manyquestions and  in some cases  vast disappointmentsremain. On arms control and non-proliferation  wehave absolutely nothing to show — an extraordinarilypoor outcome given a contemporary global securityenvironment in which proliferation threats are soclearly evident.The outdated ideology that too many delegationsbrought to negotiations was a damningly deepreflection on the intergovernmental process at theUnited Nations. We did not grasp the opportunityprovided by the largest-ever gathering of world leadersto produce a political declaration defining acts ofterrorism.How can some nations continue to assert that thedeliberate maiming and targeting of civilians issometimes justified?How is it — after atrocities in Sharm el-Sheikh Istanbul  Jakarta  Riyadh and on a daily basis in Iraq —that some continue to employ double standards deceiving themselves into believing that such terroristscould ever be considered to be “freedom fighters”?This is not an argument about the merits of aparticular cause. It is about the moral imperative tooutlaw behaviour that offends civilization.We were disappointed that the summit missed theopportunity to make progress on Security Councilreform to ensure that the Council’s membership and5functioning match the priorities and the realities of thiscentury.While the summit resolved to create a HumanRights Council  the outcome document isdisappointingly short on detail. A new Human RightsCouncil must overcome the credibility deficit thatplagues current human rights machinery and that seessome of the most egregious human rights abuserselevated to positions of leadership.Australia will participate constructively innegotiations on the shape of this new Council. We willalso more than double — to $650 000 — ourcontribution to the Office of the High Commissionerfor Human Rights.Finally  the management reforms agreed at thesummit are a step in the right direction  but they arejust that — one step.The Secretary-General needs more authority andflexibility to manage the United Nations. And — asrecent inquiries have highlighted in sobering detail —the United Nations accountability  audit and oversightsystems must be massively strengthened. It will not beeasy  but we must address anew our failures.The summit heralded an historic shift in ourthinking on humanitarian intervention  showing awillingness to embrace a new mindset  one whichaddresses our responsibility to watch out for each otherin times of need — our collective “responsibility toprotect”. Too often the world has stood by watchinghumanitarian disasters unfold before internationalmachinery has creaked into action.In Somalia  Bosnia  Rwanda and Kosovo  actiontaken was too little  too late. Today  the situation inDarfur epitomizes those shortcomings.As the Summit Outcome makes clear  all Stateshave a responsibility to protect their own populationfrom egregious crimes such as genocide and crimesagainst humanity. Where a population is sufferingserious harm  and the relevant State is unwilling orunable to stop this  the principle of non-interventionshould yield to the collective responsibility to protect.The Security Council must now rely on this newconsensus to respond more effectively to humanitariancrises.We have a responsibility to react faster tosituations of compelling human need  and we must domore to help countries rebuild  recover and reconcileafter conflicts or disasters.In the last year we have seen the people ofAfghanistan and Iraq exercise restored democraticrights. The international community must continuesupport for their transformations  help them to leavebehind the experience of brutal dictators and narrowregimes  and ensure that progress and democracy takeroot.Ceding any ground in Iraq or Afghanistan to thetyranny of terrorism and the violent suffering it bringswould be a backward step in our global campaign  acampaign we continue to fight but have not yet won  asthe July terrorist attacks in London and the ongoingterrorist menace in South-East Asia and elsewheremake clear. There remains an urgent need for nations tocome together to confront terrorists in the battle ofideas  contest extremist ideologies  and build greaterand more productive dialogue between faiths andcivilizations.Australia is doing its utmost in our region totackle terrorism and the ideology that feeds it. UnitedNations machinery must also play a part. ManyMember States still need assistance to implementUnited Nations counter-terrorism standards and buildtheir counter-terrorism capabilities — the kind ofoutcomes Australia is already pursuing in cooperationwith its regional partners. Leaders made some progressin this direction last week but did not adopt theSecretary-General’s counter-terrorism strategy.Australia welcomed the General Assembly’sadoption of the International Convention for theSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in April thisyear. Our Prime Minister  John Howard  signed thatConvention for Australia at the summit. It is nowimperative that we redouble our efforts to conclude acomprehensive convention against terrorism duringthis session of the General Assembly. Closing the gapsin the counter-terrorism legal framework is an essentialcomplement to our concerted efforts to prevent futureattacks and to prosecute those who commit terroristacts. Effective international efforts to criminalize suchacts are a vital step forward.The world today is confronted by a menace notenvisaged at the time the Geneva Conventions weredrafted — terrorist organizations and their footsoldiers  like those captured in Afghanistan  who beararms on a battlefield but pay no heed to the laws of6war  fight for no regular army  wear no uniform andbear no recognizable insignia. Just as international lawevolved to deal with a scourge of another age —piracy — so today a comprehensive convention againstterrorism is needed to help deal with these perpetratorsof terrorist acts.The summit was a lost opportunity ondisarmament and non-proliferation. Multilateral non-proliferation regimes are being tested now by a smallminority of Governments that flout the norms andstandards observed by the rest of the internationalcommunity and which in doing so imperil the securityof us all.A dangerous new dimension to this globalchallenge is the known ambition of terrorists to acquireweapons of mass destruction. It is therefore imperativethat we take practical action against proliferation as itoccurs  through innovative measures such as theProliferation Security Initiative that complement andreinforce multilateral regimes.Earlier this year I saw firsthand the ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons be thwarted bya few countries determined to prevent consensus.Australia — together with the overwhelmingmajority of States — remains unwavering in its supportfor the Non-Proliferation Treaty  and we will continueto take a leading role in universalizing the AdditionalProtocol on strengthening nuclear safeguards  makingit a precondition for the supply of uranium to non-nuclear-weapon States.It is not acceptable  in the current global climate that we have not started negotiations on a fissilematerial cut-off treaty  a treaty which would reduce therisk of leakage of fissile material to proliferators orterrorists and would buttress nuclear disarmamentgains made to date.I am pleased to be chairing the ComprehensiveTest-Ban Treaty Article XIV Conference thisafternoon  looking for ways to accelerate that Treaty’sentry into force.A firmer and more active Security Council roleon the issue of weapons of mass destruction is alsosorely needed.Australia is a committed and long-term supporterof the United Nations and of the vital role that it canplay in promoting international peace and security. Wehave a proud record of contributing to United Nationsactivities  funding and debates  extending back to itsformation in 1945.But we are not an uncritical supporter. The needto reform the United Nations has been a consistenttheme since I first addressed the General Assembly atits fifty-first session in 1996. Such a need is all themore compelling today.The reality is that there continue to be Statesfailing or in precipitous decline for no reasons otherthan poor leadership and poor governance — withdisastrous results for human lives. What does it saywhen the international community proves to beunwilling to act when misrule has caused lifeexpectancy to plunge in what was one of Africa’s mostpromising countries — from around 63 years in theearly 1990s  to just under 34 years in 2004? Wouldtoday’s United Nations be able to prevent anotherRwanda?We and the publics of the world expect much ofthe United Nations  and rightly so. The stakes are toohigh in this complex and challenging securityenvironment to accept anything less. We all have a partto play. There was some welcome progress at thesummit; but where we have fallen short we mustacknowledge it and be ambitious in pursuing moremeaningful reform. Large challenges loom before us.We should approach them with a degree of realism.Australia does not believe that the United Nations isthe answer to all the problems of the world. But theOrganization does have a role to play. When we call onthe United Nations  it must be able to fulfil that roleeffectively and expeditiously. The publics of the worldexpect nothing less."
"10",388,"AUT",60,2005,"We Austrians unfailinglykeep the United Nations in high esteem. Let me try toexplain why.Austria became a Member of the United Nationsin December 1955. That was only half a year after ourfull sovereignty had been restored through a treatyconcluded with the United States  the Soviet Union  theUnited Kingdom and France  called the Austrian StateTreaty.Fifty years ago  becoming part of the family ofnations was a powerful motive for us. We could buildon your trust. We could rely on your help. We latersolved complex problems such as the question ofSüdtirol with you  our partners in the United Nations.And we have since been eager to return to others inneed the help extended to us.More than anything else  it is our own experiencethat nurtures our confidence in the potential of theUnited Nations as a promoter of peace and a beacon ofhope for so many who face the dire challenges andthreats to our societies — be they armed conflict orhunger  terrorism or environmental disaster. We needthe United Nations to be relevant  responsive andreliable — today and in the years to come.The reform process initiated by Secretary-General Kofi Annan and reflected in the World SummitOutcome document will further enhance that potential.We may not have achieved all we were striving for  butlet us not disregard the progress made  for it will — ifacted upon — make a difference to people in need ofour support  in need of our protection.Promoting peace is the United Nations veryraison d’être. Since Austria joined the United Nations some 54 000 Austrian peacekeepers have participatedin more than 50 missions all over the world. Currently 1 200 of them are deployed in missions from Kosovoto the Golan Heights and from Afghanistan to Acehand the Sudan.It is also in the light of their practical experiencethat we welcome the new peacebuilding commission. Itwill provide specific support to people having to copewith the manifold challenges along the path from warto real peace. I wish to say one word on women in thatcontext. Creating confidence in post-conflict societiesrequires the active participation and deliberateinvolvement of women. They must become keypartners in our peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts.2The European Union  as the major donor to post-conflictreconstruction and development  will substantiallycontribute to the peacebuilding commission’s work. Itshould therefore have a place in the commission.For us and many people all over the world  themost serious failure of the present reform effort wasthe lack of agreement on effective and verifiablemeasures against nuclear proliferation and fordisarmament. We must strengthen the multilateralverification mechanisms and enable the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency to make best use of itscapacity. We must not abandon our efforts to findcommon ground on those most challenging tasks.In this vulnerable world  we need to foster trustbetween communities and peoples and help to identifyshared values. Austria thus strongly supports everyform of dialogue among civilizations  religions andcultures. In particular  we need to reach out to theIslamic world  both internationally and inside oursocieties. As a concrete contribution  Austria will hostan international conference in November on Islam in apluralistic world.Anywhere in the world  individuals will be ableto live and unfold in larger freedom only when theirfundamental needs of development  security andhuman rights are met. We need to address thoserequirements in a comprehensive and integrated manner.We are grateful to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  whoso remarkably raised awareness on that matter.The Millennium Development Goals containspecific promises of solidarity. Austria thereforewelcomes our continued common commitments  inparticular to poverty eradication and the globalpartnership for sustainable development. Incontributing to the funding effort  we will raise ourofficial development assistance to 0.51 per cent of ourgross national income by 2010.Promoting human security is an ever moredemanding task. Our decisions on the “responsibility toprotect” are a courageous step forward in internationalrelations  but more importantly  they are an offer ofhope to those most vulnerable to genocide  war crimes ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We mustnot let them down. In the words of Simon Wiesenthal who sadly passed away last night in Vienna  whatconnects 2 000 years of genocide is “too much powerin too few hands”. Ten years ago  at this Assembly Simon Wiesenthal proposed to organize a worldwideconference aimed at reducing hate. He said that“technology without hatred can be so beneficial formankind  but in conjunction with hatred it leads todisaster” (A/50/PV.66  p. 9). Reality has sinceillustrated the profound relevance of that proposal.In our globalized world  the concept ofneighbourhood has taken on a new meaning. In the eyeof disaster  we are all neighbours  no matter how far orclose. As the tsunami and recent hurricanes have taughtus  there is an emerging sense of shared destiny andresponsibility no longer limited to geographicalvicinity. Let me on this occasion express our gratitudeto all those private donors who set a mark of livingsolidarity.Austria’s clear commitment to effectivemultilateralism is at the very heart of our work in theEuropean Union and the United Nations. It is in thatspirit that we are a candidate for Security Councilmembership in 2009-2010.Promoting the rule of law is the key to anenvironment of trust within our societies. It enablesindividuals to enjoy a self-determined life. For many the rule of law is synonymous with normality andpredictability in their private and professional lives.We therefore welcome the proposed establishment of arule of law assistance unit in the Secretariat to adviseStates in their efforts towards the rule of law.One of the main achievements of the summit wasthe decision to establish a human rights council  even ifthe concrete set-up remains to be defined. In our view we need a standing body with the ability to addressurgent human rights issues swiftly and efficiently. Thatis no mere management question. What is at stake isthe new Council’s capacity to make a difference forthose in need. It is now crucial that negotiations startwithout delay in order to seize the momentum of thereform.Human rights are also a matter of education. Inthe framework of the Human Security Network Austria has therefore developed a human rights manualthat has been translated into all United Nationslanguages. It is used in training programmes in Austriaand abroad and we encourage our partners to make useof that instrument.Strengthening human rights and the rule of lawwill increase security. That is true for societies at large but it is also true for the smallest communities and3individual households. Full respect for the rights ofwomen and children is therefore indispensable in theworld of increased justice and equality we strive for.Too many women are victims of violence. We thereforewelcome the study currently being prepared by theSecretary-General on all forms of violence againstwomen.Much remains to be done. The Doha DevelopmentRound has to promote improved market access. In ourefforts to protect the environment  we have to enhancethe use of renewable energy and reduce the emission ofgreenhouse gases. We also need to finalize thecomprehensive anti-terrorism convention  as agreed at theworld summit  and adopt and implement the counter-terrorism strategy proposed by the Secretary-General.Real freedom is within reach if we  through theUnited Nations  join our forces to promote peace security and justice — not only freedom from want andfreedom from fear  but eventually freedom to live indignity for both women and men across the globe."
"11",413,"AZE",60,2005,"At the outset Iwould like to congratulate you  Mr. President  on yourelection to the presidency of the sixtieth session of theGeneral Assembly. I have known you personally for along time as a very skilful and highly professionaldiplomat and I wish you every success in making newachievements in that highly responsible post. I wouldalso like to express our appreciation to yourpredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  for the competence anddedication with which he guided the work of the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly.While it is too early to assess the impact of the2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1)adopted at the High-level Plenary Meeting  I willventure to say that the path leading up to it was thorny if not challenging  at times.Azerbaijan has always been and will remaincommitted to the purposes  principles and valuesenshrined in the United Nations Charter and otherlandmark documents. Respect for the norms andprinciples of international law and diligent observanceof international obligations by Member States serve asindicators of their adherence to those values andprinciples.Azerbaijan fully supports a collective approach tosecurity. We are committed to taking concerted action in conformity with the United Nations Charter  toremove threats to peace and security  foster sustainable24economic development and support democracy-building and protection of human rights.We reaffirm our determination to continue thereforms that will eventually improve the functionalcapacity of the United Nations and its decision-makingprocesses  especially with regard to crisis and conflictmanagement.Since our accession to the United Nations  theOrganization has been closely associated in our societywith our hopes for the liberation of the territories ofAzerbaijan occupied by Armenia. Although theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) is deeply involved in the settlement process the prompt response of the Security Council to theoccupation of the territories of Azerbaijan and theadoption of four Security Council resolutions — 822(1993)  853 (1993)  874 (1993) and 884 (1993) — stillgives us hope for the peaceful settlement of the conflictin and around the Nagorny Karabakh region of theRepublic of Azerbaijan. The principles unanimouslyadopted by the Security Council in those resolutionscontinue to be the basis for the settlement of theconflict.Last year the General Assembly’s considerationof the agenda item entitled “The situation in theoccupied territories of Azerbaijan” played a crucialrole in attracting attention to the dangerous practicescarried out by Armenia in the occupied territories ofAzerbaijan.As for the negotiation process itself  I must admitthat we are now at a critical juncture where the chancesfor resolution of the conflict are cautiously optimistic.The Government of Azerbaijan remains committed tothe peaceful settlement of this protracted conflict based on respect for the norms and principles ofinternational law  the implementation of the relevantSecurity Council resolutions and related OSCEdocuments and decisions. We expect that the Armenianside will take a similarly constructive approach andwill not miss this window of opportunity.There is no room for illusions. Azerbaijan willnever compromise its territorial integrity. Only thereturn of all the occupied territories to Azerbaijan willhelp restore our trust and confidence in Armenia andits declared intention of establishing good-neighbourlyrelations with Azerbaijan. Such a step would removethe label of aggressor from the Government ofArmenia — a label it inherited after it occupied theterritories of Azerbaijan — and allow both parties tobenefit from the opportunities the settlement of theconflict will bring.We are ready to provide security assurances forthe Armenian population of the Nagorny Karabakhregion of Azerbaijan. As for the status of the region  itis necessary to create favourable conditions for thesecure and dignified return of the expelled Azerbaijanipopulation to the Nagorny Karabakh region and toother occupied territories  to establish normal livingconditions there and to provide opportunities foreconomic development for both communities.Once the agreement is achieved  for both politicaland legal guarantees of its implementation we willneed the international community’s support for thedeployment of multinational peacekeeping forces demining  the restoration of communications  therehabilitation of lands and the provision of securityguarantees for the population in the Nagorny Karabakhregion of Azerbaijan  including the creation of localpolice forces in the region for both Armenian andAzerbaijani communities.Last but not least  I should like to make a pointon conflict resolution. It concerns the issue of thecommunication of Armenians living in the NagornyKarabakh region of Azerbaijan with Armenia and thatof Azerbaijanis living in the Nakhchivan region ofAzerbaijan with the rest of the country. We suggest thatthe so-called Lachin corridor — which should be calleda road of peace — be used by both sides in bothdirections  provided that security on the road is ensuredby the multinational peacekeeping force in the initialstage.The road’s importance extends beyond thepractical benefits of direct transport communicationsbetween Armenia and Azerbaijan; the road should beconsidered  first and foremost  as the path leading topeace and cooperation in the South Caucasus region.Today  from this rostrum  after the recent meeting ofthe Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia  held inKazan on 26 August 2005  I urge the Armenian sidenot to miss this opportunity to move the negotiationprocess forward with the assistance of theCo-Chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group  inaccordance with the key understandings reached in thePrague process.Azerbaijan believes that development reinforcesdemocratic transformation  the rule of law and respect25for human rights. We agree that it is urgent andimportant to achieve the international developmentagenda. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)remain an indispensable part of that agenda andrepresent measures of States’ contributions to andimpacts on global efforts in their quest for a betterexistence.Cooperation in the areas of debt  assistance andtrade can open up new opportunities for developmentfinancing and can reinforce national efforts to mobilizeneeded resources. Here  the special development needsof Africa deserve serious attention. Azerbaijantherefore welcomes the recent decision by the Group ofEight Governments to cancel the debt of heavilyindebted poor countries.We also consider official development assistanceto be an important investment in self-sustainingdevelopment. We firmly believe that  if aid is to beeffective  greater interagency coordination is requiredat all levels. The United Nations Development Groupand the United Nations Resident Coordinator have acritical role to play in this field. We fully support thestrengthening of both structures.Yet another area requiring increased cooperationis international trade. Addressing issues related toimproving market access and terms of trade as well asovercoming supply side constraints can revive theDoha round. Azerbaijan believes that the 2005 worldsummit will renew the sense of urgency to build strongpolitical will and a coherent policy approach aimed atcreating a more favourable multilateral trade systemduring the forthcoming ministerial meeting of theWorld Trade Organization  to be held in Hong Kong. Inthe meantime  we believe that the developmentchallenges of landlocked developing countries shouldbe effectively addressed  bearing in mind the recentlyadopted Asunción Platform for the Doha DevelopmentRound.We recognize the crucial role of regionalorganizations  including United Nations regionalcommissions  in enhancing regional cooperation topromote sustainable development. Azerbaijan placesemphasis on the development of transregional transportand communication lines and makes its contributionthrough the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and theBaku-Tbilisi-Erzerum natural gas pipeline. We alsolook forward to the building of a new Baku-Akhalkalaki-Tbilisi-Kars railroad.Azerbaijan is committed to poverty eradicationand has identified it as an overarching goal in itsdevelopment strategies. Although we are encouragedby the implementation perspectives presented in thereport of the Millennium Project  we highlight the needfor assistance to complement the efforts of nationalleadership  especially in the areas of capacity-building science and technology and environmental protection.The achievement of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals requires not only public investment ininfrastructure and human capital  but also investmentin improving governance  which includes an efficient properly resourced and adequately staffed institutionalsystem as well as political accountability  transparencyand participation. Azerbaijan attaches particularimportance to progress in this area. In recognition ofthe central role of good governance in povertyreduction and development  we have formulatedadditional national MDGs to address governanceissues. Specific targets in that area include  inter alia reform of the overall State system of publicadministration  legislation and policy by the year 2015.Recognizing the destructive effects of naturaldisasters on the sustainable development of countriesand communities  Azerbaijan  as a disaster-pronecountry  believes that efforts aimed at disastermitigation should place particular emphasis onawareness-raising programmes and on the developmentof early warning capacities.It is clear that national ownership of the design implementation and coordination of humanitarianresponse and transition programmes in both post-disaster and post-conflict situations is essential toensure the desired impact and the sustainability of suchprogrammes. However  there is a need for the efficientsharing of responsibilities between national authoritiesand international humanitarian and development actors particularly in protracted humanitarian situations withmass displacement and limited national capacities totackle all existing problems. Humanitarian assistanceand funding should not be limited to providingimmediate responses to crises; they must take intoaccount long-term needs in the transition phase.Promoting human rights and the rule of law hasbeen an integral part of our national developmentstrategy as a result of our conviction that the fullenjoyment of human rights  while a goal in itself serves as a foundation for sustainable development. We26need to increase our ability to deal with human rightschallenges and to adequately respond to them particularly in times of conflict and crisis.In conclusion  I would like to assure theAssembly that Azerbaijan will remain committed to theideals that are the foundation of the Organization  andto express my confidence that at this critical juncturefor multilateralism  the international community willspare no effort to make the United Nations moreefficient and more relevant to the needs of its MemberStates."
"12",459,"BDI",60,2005,"It is adistinct honour to address this Assembly on theoccasion of the sixtieth regular session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations  an importantmilestone in the life of our Organization. We wouldlike to take this opportunity to express our warmcongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan Secretary-General of the United Nations  for the skilland dynamism he has displayed in leading ourOrganization. We would also like to pay tribute to hisdedication to the cause of peace and to the interest hehas always paid to the people of Burundi during theirdifficult times. Allow us also at this memorable time toexpress our profound gratitude to the Security Councilof the United Nations for the resolute will it hasdisplayed in accompanying the people of Burundi stepby step in their search for peace.Our country has just entered an essential phase inits history. In political terms  after more than ten yearsof war and a lengthy period of transition  the mainprotagonists in the conflict have agreed to bury thehatchet. Free  pluralist  fair and transparent electionswere the culmination of this long process. Indeed  itwas at the end of a genuine electoral marathon involving local  legislative  senatorial and presidentialelections  that the people of Burundi overwhelminglychose the programme and candidates of my party  theCNDD-FDD (Conseil National pour la Défense de laDémocratie  Forces pour la Défense de la Démocratie) in calm and in dignity. This was an indisputable andundisputed victory recognized and acknowledged byall of the many foreign observers. The political partieshave also accepted the verdict of the ballot boxes.In order to enable every opportunity for nationalharmony and establish democracy once again  we havejust set up a Government of broad national unionconsisting of all the elements of the Burundi people with its political  social  ethnic and regional diversity  aGovernment where women hold the significantposition they deserve.We are especially pleased to note the genuinesocial and mental change represented by the entry ofBurundian women into the political sphere. Today women hold 35 per cent of posts in the executivebranch. Their presence is notable in all Stateinstitutions. For the first time in my country’s history 2the National Assembly is presided over by a womanand two women are vice-presidents of the Senate. Atthe Government level  one of the two vice-presidenciesof the Republic is held by a woman. Women headseven of the 20 ministries  including in such importantposts as justice  foreign relations and planning. Lastly many women are working in provincial and communaladministrations.Our Government cherishes the hope that thiscontribution of women’s talents to managing the affairsof State will help to strengthen democracy by giving ita warmer  more thoughtful and peaceful image.We are also pleased that the democratic spirit ofcohesion and unity in diversity which has breathed newlife into the political scene is also being felt in theinstitutions of defence and security. Indeed  yesterday’santagonists — the former Burundian armed forces andthe armed groups arrayed against them — have beenmerged into new forces  known as the NationalDefence Force and the National Police of Burundi  inwhich all the country’s players are represented. Thatfact is rare enough to warrant highlighting.All of those profound changes have been madepossible by the synergy between the concern of theinternational community  the courage and maturity ofthe Burundian people  and the willingness tocompromise of the political class. We express ourwarmest thanks to all the international partners thataccompanied us on our long road to peace. Inparticular  we would single out the regional initiative the United Nations Operation in Burundi  mediatorsMwalimu Julius Nyerere and President Mandela facilitator Jacob Zuma  the European Union  the UnitedStates of America  the African Union and manyfriendly countries  especially those that contributedtroops to the peacekeeping force as well as financiallogistic means.Peace in our country  like the lasting success ofour democratic experience  is closely linked to thestability of the regional environment. We thereforewelcome the efforts to restore peace  stability andsustainable development in the Great Lakes region. Weare closely following and actively participating in thepreparations for the International Conference on theGreat Lakes Region  now being organized underUnited Nations and African Union auspices  with thesupport of the region’s Group of Friends.We are one with our world village. Nothing thatoccurs there does not touch us. Threats to peace andsecurity sneer at borders. We call today for an urgentpartnership to combat terrorism. In that context  thegeneral convention on international terrorism  onceconcluded  will be an innovative legal instrument inaddressing issues that have yet to be regulated.We also need to stem the phenomenon of drugtrafficking  which — with its many corollaries including child labour  the sex industry and illegalmigration — is transforming human beings intotwenty-first century commodities.Combating terrorism must include promoting aculture of peace. It would thus be useful to use theInternational Decade for the Culture of Peace to buildthe defences of peace in the minds of men and women particularly through education  the media  faith-basedorganizations and cultural programmes aimed atchildren.Terrorism is also a denial of human rights. Wetherefore welcome the decision to create the humanrights council to promote respect for those rights. Thecouncil will allow us to end the partisan bickeringprevalent in the Commission on Human Rights.As to the reform of the Security Council andother United Nations organs  our Government supportsthe position of the African Union.With respect to good governance  ourGovernment is committed to taking appropriatemeasures to establish good governance in all itsaspects. We refer in particular to capacity-building  themobilization of domestic resources and theimplementation of strategies to combat corruption fraud and embezzlement. We will soon be unveiling anew law and anti-corruption squad.We are committed to fighting impunity  for wewant to strive for impartial justice  not only bybuilding our capacities in that sphere  but also byreforming the sectors involved in that issue. In thatcontext  we request in particular the internationalcommunity’s assistance in the urgent establishment ofa truth and reconciliation commission.In the socio-economic field  we hope that theestablishment of new elected  democratic institutionswill lay the groundwork for robust legitimacy andeffectiveness in our reconstruction and socio-economicdevelopment strategies. We wish to prioritize the3rehabilitation of social and economic infrastructuredestroyed during the war and the reintegration ofexpatriates  internally displaced persons  demobilizedsoldiers and war victims.We also intend to attach high priority toeducation. Thus  when we came to power  we decidedto provide free primary schooling to all children by thebeginning of the 2005-2006 school year. That prioritygoal for education requires the development andimplementation of ambitious and urgent programmes totrain qualified teachers  rebuild schools and obtain neweducational materials.For the period 2006-2008  we are planning for theconstruction of at least one primary school for eachcensus area  totalling some 350 primary schools. Thatwill involve the construction of 800 classrooms in2006  the recruitment of 2 000 new teachers and theacquisition of teaching materials at an estimated cost of$15 million. In that same context  we will prioritizeprofessional training  particularly in the agricultural paramedical  technical and trade fields  in order tohasten the country’s reconstruction. By 2008  weexpect to build in each province a technical secondaryschool with several departments and a capacity of atleast 1 000 pupils.Increased financial resources will be necessaryand we know that we can count on the assistance of theinternational community. In that regard  we support theinnovative proposal of the French Government to findnew sources of development financing by imposing alevy on air tickets.Much remains to be done in the area of health.Our Government has undertaken to develop a policy tomake significant improvements in universal access tohealth care  and to implement the national strategicplan to combat HIV/AIDS  an essential component ofwhich is capacity-building in HIV/AIDS preventionand treatment.The achievements of my country  particularly inthe political and security fields  are important steps inthe right direction. Nevertheless  they are only the startof a process that must be consolidated.In particular  we will have to resume activities tocombat poverty and re-establish economic growth  twoessential measures that will allow our people to reapthe dividends of peace.The support of the entire population for the peaceprocess and the programme for economic growth isessential. But how can the people feel that the newpolicy includes them if their living conditions are notrapidly improved? That is why the support of theinternational community in this difficult period is ofsupreme importance. We make an urgent appeal to theinternational community to ensure that the level andquality of their commitments will respond to theinsistent expectations of our population and to the newdemocratic changes."
"13",506,"BEL",60,2005,"Allow me to congratulate you most warmly  Sir  onyour election as President of the General Assembly.Through you  I would like also to thank yourpredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  for the manner in which heconducted the preparatory work for the summit ofHeads of State and Government which has just takenplace. We are very grateful to him for havingsuccessfully met that challenge.Even though we had hoped for a more ambitiousagreement  the summit allowed us to create a much-needed new impetus and new strategic guidelines forour Organization. Only a stronger and more legitimateUnited Nations will be able to respond to thechallenges of the twenty-first century and implementthe collective security consensus that we endorsed inthe summit's outcome document.Belgium is a strong advocate of efficientmultilateralism. I emphasize the word ""efficient""because this is not just a declaration of faith. We needcredible structures and strong institutions capable ofeffectively implementing our internationalcommitments and addressing our common concerns. Itis all too easy to indulge in rhetoric; we have totranslate our words into action. That is why  in thatcontext  I am pleased with the progress made duringthe summit.I am particularly pleased with the consensusreached whereby security  peace  development andhuman rights are not only interlinked but mutuallyreinforcing. That is a significant step forward in ourefforts to build a more peaceful  more prosperous andmore equitable world. That idea will guide our actionsand form the basis of our approach. Without peace there can be no development  and human rights canoften be sorely tested. In the absence of developmentand respect for human rights  stability and securitybecome elusive.The link between development  stability andhuman rights becomes most acutely apparent in fragileor failing States. These are often States devastated byconflict or by civil war - States whose leaders are nolonger capable of meeting the basic needs of theirpeople. Often  their economic situation has deteriorateddramatically  and sometimes their society itself is indisarray. A large number of the people of such Statesmay be displaced. They may have fled  may be subjectto abuse or exploitation and therefore cannot enjoy anyof the guarantees that a State should be able to provideto its citizens.Some States are at risk of becoming zones oflawlessness  in which terrorist and criminal activitiescan thrive. The uncontrolled exploitation of naturalresources can fuel all sorts of criminal networks orconflicts - often with an ethnic dimension - in whichlarge numbers of weapons can circulate uncontrolled.Such States must return to peace  stability and therule of law. They must take control of their own futureand gradually begin to consider their prospects fordevelopment. This is not an easy task. The challenge istremendous. Almost simultaneously  it is necessary torebuild State institutions; disarm combatants  givethem new prospects and reintegrate them intocommunities that are often impoverished; reorganizethe army and security forces; and give the State themeans to restore its authority  organize elections andcreate conditions conducive to development.We must help them break that vicious circle andregain their place in the community of nations. In thatrespect  the establishment of a PeacebuildingCommission is crucial. The creation of such aCommission not only illustrates our common resolve tohelp such States on their path to recovery; it allows us first and foremost  better to coordinate and focus ourefforts. Political  humanitarian  military and financialresources must be mobilized and used effectively toachieve our common goals.That is particularly true in the case of sub-Saharan African countries that are ravaged by deadlyand prolonged conflicts  with the primary victimsbeing the civilian population.The establishment of such a Commission wouldgenerate great hope. It is our common responsibility tomake it a success. Belgium wants to contributeactively  including by sharing the experience itacquired in the transition processes in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and in Burundi.Belgium also attaches great importance topromoting the protection of human rights. My countrywelcomes the strengthening of the Office of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights and the decision toestablish a Human Rights Council. But we regret thatthe summit was not able to finalize the Councilísmodalities.11Belgium has fully supported the reform and willcontinue to focus on it. Democracy and respect forhuman rights are some of our common values andunderpin our efforts to promote peace and stability.From now on  those values will be part of ourcollective security consensus and must be incorporatedinto our global approach throughout the entire UnitedNations system. They are our common responsibility.Among the summit's other achievements  Ishould like also to highlight the ""responsibility toprotect"". This represents a step forward in the quest forsolutions to the most glaring injustices. In theaftermath of the genocides that marked our lastcentury  we solemnly pledged that such atrocitieswould never happen again.Let me now turn to good governance  which isessential if our efforts to create a more stable andprosperous world are to be successful. The summitoutcome document repeatedly underlines itsimportance  and rightly so.Good governance is not a moralistic conceptimposed from the outside. It is not about giving goodor bad grades  and even less about good and badstudents. It is not for others to say what are goodpolicies and what are bad policies. No ó goodgovernance is synonymous with effective governanceand goes hand in hand with sovereignty. It is aboutgovernance that can produce results  make a differencefor citizens and create fertile ground for development.Without it  the support of the international communitycannot produce the desired results. Without it  the aidof the international community will not find the fertileground essential to create the conditions for greaterprosperity and stability.We have pledged to attain the objective ofallocating 0.7 per cent of our gross national product toofficial development assistance. We will keep ourpromise. But we are aware that development is notonly a question of money; first and foremost  it is aquestion of the effective use of resources. Thenecessary conditions must be established. What mattersis the outcome on the ground. Poverty is not inevitable;all peoples have a future that belongs to them. Theymust take charge of it.We accordingly have stated  in paragraph 11 ofthe summit outcome document (resolution 60/1)  ""goodgovernance and the rule of law ... are essential forsustained economic growth  sustainable developmentand the eradication of poverty and hunger"". In the sameoutcome document  we also clearly reaffirmed ourcommitment to good governance and the rule of law and reaffirmed that each country must takeresponsibility for its own development. Those are theterms of our global partnership for development  as setout in the Millennium Declaration  the MonterreyConsensus and the Johannesburg Plan ofImplementation.All components of the international communityhave demonstrated generosity. That is particularly trueof the European Union. But the internationalcommunity can hardly be held responsible for thefailure of States to protect or assist all or part of theirpopulations. It is difficult to understand why today wemust launch donor appeals to deal with the large-scaledestruction of houses by a Government thatdeliberately leaves some 500 000 of its citizenshomeless.That reasoning with regard to the subject of goodgovernance also applies to the similar concepts ofdemocracy and the rule of law. Those are extremelyimportant objectives  both for the development of oursocieties and for the security of States. But  neitherdemocracy nor the rule of law can be artificiallyimposed from outside. This is not about dictatingexogenous models; we must take a bottom-up approachin creating suitable conditions for the emergence ofmechanisms that ensure people's equitableparticipation in their own governance  in a spirit ofinclusivity. In that regard  our first priorities should bethe modernization of societies and States and theemancipation of women and children and theirinclusion in the global dynamic. Past experience showsthat the shortest path to democracy and the rule of lawis the modernization of society. The role - indeed  theresponsibility - of the international community is togalvanize that modernization process.We have a great responsibility. Before the end ofthe year  the Peacebuilding Commission must beestablished. We also have the task of making theHuman Rights Council operational. I sincerely hopethat the spirit that prevailed during the summit willalso guide the work of the sixtieth session of theGeneral Assembly. We must continue to showdetermination  perseverance and vision in carrying outour work. Only through constant commitment will wemake the United Nations the primary instrument forinternational relations.12That is the important task ahead of us. Our owncredibility is at stake. We must once again make theUnited Nations the instrument par excellence of ourstrategy to build a more stable and more prosperousworld for all. Our peoples demand that. Belgium iswilling to rise to that challenge and to shoulder itsresponsibilities."
"14",551,"BEN",60,2005,"Allow mefirst of all to pay tribute to Mr. Jean Ping  who guidedthe work of the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly with great energy. He had the tremendousresponsibility of negotiating the United Nationsreforms adopted by our heads of State or Governmenton Friday  16 September. We commend him on hiscourage  his faith in the future of the United Nationsand the wisdom and vision with which he dischargedhis functions.The tasks facing Mr. Jan Eliasson are inspiringand crucially important. His presidency marks thebeginning of the implementation phase of the majordecisions taken by our heads of State or Governmenton reform. We are grateful to him for focusing thework of the sixtieth session on this topic.My delegation has another good reason to bepleased at seeing Mr. Eliasson presiding over our work:the importance his country attaches to developmentissues and its very sizeable contribution to the effortsof the international community to eliminate povertythroughout the world. Our two countries  Benin andSweden  successfully co-chaired the GeneralAssembly’s Open-ended Working Group on an Agendafor Development. All of this bodes well for thissession.The eradication of poverty tops the priority list ofthe Benin Government. In this context  we negotiatedand adopted  with the Bretton Woods institutions  aPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Its effectiveimplementation  jointly with our Government’s plan ofaction and our national studies on long-term prospects entitled “Benin 2005: ALAFIA”  should set intomotion progress that will bring about the achievementof the Millennium Development Goals. However  itwill still be necessary for the efforts carried out withour bilateral and multilateral development partners toconverge to improve the situation in the seven criticalareas for making aid to least developed countrieseffective. These are: substantially reducing the externaldebt burden of least developed countries so they candevote greater domestic resources to eliminatingpoverty; strengthening institutional capacity to attractforeign direct investment and develop free enterprise;diversifying the destinations of foreign directinvestment; promoting public sector/private sectorpartnership in least developed countries to promoterural development; strengthening the impact ofremittances from our diaspora; the promotion of South-South investment to improve the availability ofproducts on markets; and  strengthening the potentialof microcredit to eliminate poverty.We are gratified at the decision taken inGleneagles  Scotland  by the Group of Eight (G-8) tocompletely cancel the debt of 18 highly indebted poorcountries  13 of which are least developed countries.We urgently appeal to donor countries to seriouslyconsider the possibility of extending the benefit of thisnew positive measure to all least developed countries.The Coordinating Bureau of the Least DevelopedCountries  which my country has had the honour ofchairing since 2002  will continue consulting with12international financial institutions and developmentpartners in close cooperation with the HighRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries Landlocked Developing Countries and Small IslandDeveloping States  to bring about meaningful progressin all these areas. This is the context of the ministerialconference of the least developed countries onremittances from migrant workers. The conference willbe held in Cotonou  Benin  in February 2006  not inOctober 2005 as originally planned. In the context ofthis conference  the 50 least developed countries areplanning to set up an international monitoring body forfunds transfers by migrant workers; it will be open toall States. We urge all United Nations Member Statesto support this initiative  which is intended tostrengthen the impact of these transferred resources onthe development of recipient countries.In addition to these considerations that directlyaffect the least developed countries  there is an urgentneed to promote and give appropriate weight to thedevelopment agenda within the context of multilateraltrade negotiations in the World Trade Organization andto translate into deeds the firm commitments by thecountries concerned on the elimination of agriculturalsubsidies  in particular those for cotton  to which mycountry attaches particular importance. Such a measurewould remove a considerable handicap on developingcountries’ efforts to fully take advantage of theircomparative advantages in order to become fullyintegrated into the world economy. We reaffirm that itis indispensable that access to world markets becoupled with measures to strengthen the supply ofproducts from developing countries through adequatesupport for the local processing of commodities.No initiative  no measure  no activity and nodecision in the field of development can be successfulwithout peace. It is of particular concern that  onessential matters such as disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  the United Nationscannot forge the required consensus to secure the long-term survival of our planet in view of the potential forself-destruction that has built up. These questionsshould be considered calmly  with the higher interestsof humankind in mind  setting aside the particularinterest of any country in pursuing some hypotheticalpower that would reduce security for each and everyone of us.Benin has no objection to the peaceful use ofnuclear power to serve the energy needs of the planet but it feels that any effort to divert peacefulprogrammes to military programmes runs counter to avision of collective security based on promotingdisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction.Our heads of State or Government decided toconfirm the Security Council’s key role as the organwith primary responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. We urge all membersof the Assembly to commit themselves to ensuring thatthe Security Council is expanded to make it morerepresentative and better able to counter old and newthreats to international peace and security.In the 60 years of existence of the UnitedNations  the Security Council has with varying degreesof success  worked to manage and settle armedconflicts. It has been able to respond to breaches ofinternational peace and security  but it has not alwaysbeen able to take action to stop or reverse events thathave led to an explosion of violence or armed conflict.Given the loss of human life and the massivedestruction of property as a result of current threats  itis high time for the Security Council to attach higherpriority to conflict prevention  in the spirit of Article34 of the Charter  which states that“The Security Council may investigate anydispute  or any situation which might lead tointernational friction or give rise to a dispute  inorder to determine whether the continuance of thedispute or situation is likely to endanger themaintenance of international peace and security”.If we look at the spirit and the letter of thisprovision  the Security Council is definitely competentto analyse and monitor situations involving the risk ofconflict or a breach of the peace anywhere in the worldand to become actively involved in managing crisesbefore conflict breaks out or threats materialize. It is inthat light that we must view Security Councilresolution 1625 (2005)  adopted at the 14 September2005 Council summit at the initiative of the threeAfrican members of the Security Council  led by mycountry  Benin.In the context of Security Council reform  theGeneral Assembly should consider the subject of aproactive approach and reflect on how to structuresupport mechanisms in order to enable the Council toeffectively play its role in the prevention of conflictsand of threats to international peace and security.13Peace remains an invaluable and incalculablegood. We share the concerns expressed recently by theSecretary-General at the launch of his Alliance ofCivilizations initiative. That constructive initiativeshould be made part of the framework of activities tocounter threats to our world  including terrorism whose predominant religious ties lend credence totheories of a clash of civilizations leading to certainchaos. Benin supports the Alliance of Civilizationsinitiative  which aims to restore peace in our hearts andamong religions so that weapons will fall silent and ourpeoples will be able to express their aspirations forpeace.We join the quest for peace of those peoples wholack peace today. We express our solidarity withpeoples suffering armed conflicts in Africa  the MiddleEast  Asia  Latin America and Europe. TheOrganization must redouble its efforts to help themprocure national concord  understanding and cohesion.In that context  we are pursuing a thoroughgoingcampaign against the recruitment and the use ofchildren in armed conflicts. Now that the SecurityCouncil has adopted its resolution 1612 (2005)  theGeneral Assembly  for its part  should establish anopen-ended working group to consider proposals foractions to redefine that scourge as a crime againsthumanity instead of a war crime. We are counting oneveryone’s support to make that initiative a reality.In the Middle East  the withdrawal of theoccupying Power from the Gaza Strip and part of theWest Bank brings us closer  fortunately  to our commonvision of an independent State of Palestine living sideby side with the State of Israel within secure andinternationally recognized borders. We believe that theQuartet’s road map can lead the Israeli and Palestinianpeoples to that goal. We call upon their leaders toremain committed to the route of peace.We ask the same of Iraqi leaders and urge them tospare no effort to ensure that all Iraqi communitiesparticipate in the transition process leading to therestoration of peace and the strengthening of thecountry’s unity. We make the same appeal toAfghanistan  Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire  among others.In the same spirit of dialogue  we welcome thesignificant progress made in resolving the conflicts ofWest Africa through the cooperation between theUnited Nations and the Economic Community of WestAfrican States aimed at promoting dynamicpeacebuilding processes for the gradual return ofnormality in the countries affected by conflict and forpreventing the spread of conflict  through anintegrated  regional approach.We invite all Ivorian parties to overcome theirdifferences of view and give peace and stability achance in the West African subregion. The holding ofthe International Conference on the Great LakesRegion and the remarkable success achieved by thetransition processes in the Central African Republicand Burundi have restored the prospects of the entireregion. We encourage the countries concerned to reacha regional agreement for peace  security  goodgovernance and development in the framework of thesecond regional summit  to be held in Nairobi  and toscrupulously implement that agreement in order topromote peace  stability and prosperity in the region.Those regional initiatives require enhancedassistance from the international community if thetransition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo isto be a success. In that context  Benin intends to pursueits policy of active participation in peacekeepingoperations. Our country stands ready to increase itscontribution to the international community’s efforts inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo in order tosupport the democratic transition process under way.In East Africa  the United Nations and theAfrican Union have formed an unprecedentedpartnership to restore peace in the Sudan and put anend to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur  in the spirit ofChapter VIII of the Charter. Such a partnership isessential also in Somalia. In that context  it is in theinterest of the United Nations to assist the AfricanUnion in establishing and organizing its peacekeepingcapacities  in particular by strengthening the structuresfor planning and for training national and subregionalcontingents of the African standby force.Another essential element to which we attachgreat importance  and which we hope to see realizedpromptly  relates to the decision taken by our heads ofState or Government on the establishment of a standingpolice force. The establishment of such a force shouldtake into consideration the need for linguistic balancein accordance with short-term and medium-termdeployment needs. The modalities of the force’scomposition should be defined promptly. To that end we propose carrying out a rapid evaluation of presentworldwide human resources and of Member States’14capacity to train police officers. A rational process inthat area would consist of taking best advantage ofthose capacities and giving all Member States an equalopportunity for participation in the new force.Beyond peacemaking action  the need to helpcountries emerging from armed conflict remain on thepath of peace and overcome the risk of relapseconstitutes a real challenge to which we haveadequately responded through our reflections on therole of the United Nations. That is the reason behindthe Peacebuilding Commission. The consensus on thisquestion does honour to the Organization. TheCommission must become operational as soon aspossible to strengthen action to assist countries thathave undertaken particularly difficult democratictransitions  such as Burundi  the Central AfricanRepublic and Guinea-Bissau  if their Governmentsrequest such assistance.Countries facing an ongoing state of socialemergency can improve their chances for lastingstability only if the international community mobilizesthe necessary resources to help restore a minimum ofnormality by ensuring that those States can exercisetheir sovereign rights in the areas of security and theprovision of essential social services such as healthcare  child education  transport and access to financialresources.The success of disarmament  demobilization andreintegration programmes in all their aspects isdecisive for making a peace process irreversible andfor guarding against the risk of the spread of conflictcaused by the dispersion of former combatants thathave not successfully reintegrated into productive civilsociety. The international community must ensure thatthe reintegration component of those programmes alsoreceives adequate financing.In the same context  the Human Rights Councilmust take its place in the machinery of the UnitedNations. Its mandate  size  structure and operationalprocedures must take into account the requirements ofrepresentativity  credibility and effectiveness bydrawing all lessons from the experience and thepractices of the Commission on Human Rights  whichit is intended to replace. In that regard  the newCouncil must become the preferred instrument foridentifying cases in which the international communityshould exercise its responsibility to protectpopulations. In that regard  the Human Rights Councilalso has a crucial role to play as an early-warningstructure within the United Nations system and as akey element of its conflict-prevention machinery.We cannot conclude without underlining our fullsupport for the excellent idea of the Government ofSweden to create a network of heads of State and otherworld leaders to monitor effective implementation ofUnited Nations reform."
"15",597,"BFA",60,2005,"Burkina Faso is delighted to see thisimportant session of the General Assembly beingpresided over by an illustrious son of a great country Sweden  with which we have maintained exemplaryand fruitful relations of friendship and cooperation forseveral decades.I hasten to assure the President of the fullcooperation of my delegation. It is also my pleasure topay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  whosetalents as a seasoned and effective diplomat we havebeen able to appreciate throughout the fifty-ninthsession of the General Assembly.I would like to associate in this tribute theSecretary-General  a man of great vision  who has beenthe architect of this new United Nations that we haveso earnestly sought and who has had the courage to layits foundations.The current session will receive specific notice inthe annals of the United Nations. Apart from itscoinciding with both the midterm review of theMillennium Development Goals and the reform of theOrganization  this session is also being held at awatershed in world history and international relations.In Africa  despite the constant efforts of Statesand regional groupings  the persistence of numerousconflicts and hot spots continues to be a subject ofmajor concern. I am thinking particularly of thesituation in the Great Lakes Region  Darfur  Somaliaand Côte d’Ivoire. In the Middle East  the struggle forsurvival is the daily battle of the Palestinian people. Itis our conviction that only the strict implementation ofthe Road Map will make peace possible in that sorelytried region.The numerous terrorist acts throughout the worldclaim our attention and remind us of how vulnerablewe are in the face of terrorism. We must  henceforth realize that no strategy  no matter how energetic itmight be  will be able to wipe out this scourge  unlessit attacks the underlying causes  which are injustice exclusion  humiliation and poverty. It is quite obviousthat desperate behaviour stems from those sources.More than ever  the quest for democracy  goodgovernance and respect for human rights has becomepart and parcel of the daily behaviour of peoples andnations. It is this vision that makes it so necessary thatunprecedented reform be carried out of the UnitedNations  which  60 years after its creation  is dutybound to take full account of the new challenges andnew problems that have arisen. In this connection  onceagain we should welcome the Secretary-General’slucidity and farsightedness  whose report “In LargerFreedom” (A/59/2005) gives us a thought-provokingframework  indicating that comprehensive andthorough reform is essential for our Organization.Furthermore  the African position on this reform particularly that relating to the Security Council  isnow well known. Burkina Faso is convinced thatjustice must be done to Africa and has fully joined theother members of the African Union to formulate acommon platform that will make it possible for Africato reclaim without hesitation its legitimate place in theessential United Nations decision-making bodies.7Nevertheless  however committed and howeverpassionate our debate is on the reform of the UnitedNations  it is of paramount importance that we giveeven greater priority to the question of development.Speaking of development  as is so aptly pointedout in the final document of the High-level Meetingthat we have just adopted  it is not so much promisesand commitments that are lacking but rather theirdiligent and consistent fulfilment  given the urgencyand acuteness of the problems we face. Under thesecircumstances  Burkina Faso willingly associates itselfwith all activities that promote genuine internationalsolidarity.That is why we have associated ourselves withPresident Lula da Silva’s anti-hunger initiative. That isalso why we support President Jacques Chirac’sinternational solidarity contribution initiative involvingan airline ticket levy  which is aimed at helping tofinance the struggle against AIDS  tuberculosis andmalaria; Prime Minister Tony Blair’s InternationalFinance Facility; Qatar’s Fund for Development andHumanitarian Assistance; and President George W.Bush’s Millennium Challenge Account  of which mycountry has just become a beneficiary.Burkina Faso also welcomes the G-8’s recentdecision to cancel the multilateral debts of a number ofdeveloping countries. We hope that additionalcountries will be included on that list.There can be no doubt that trade relationsbetween industrialized and developing countriescontinue to be marred by inequality — even inequity. Itis therefore essential to recall the need to respect therules of the multilateral trading system  which are thefoundation of the World Trade Organization.It should therefore be clear why Burkina Fasocontinues to demand an end to the unfair exportsubsidies of the countries of the North  particularly asconcerns cotton.Burkina Faso is a staunch proponent ofdemocracy  good governance  respect for human rights and peace and development in Africa and throughoutthe world. In that context  it is actively involved inpeacekeeping operations in Africa and in other regions.Furthermore  my country  which currently holds thechairmanship of the Community of Sahelo-SaharanStates and of the International Organization of LaFrancophonie  is proud to serve the cause of regionalintegration and of international brotherhood andsolidarity.We believe that working for peace also meansrespecting international conventions. We thereforebelieve it to be our duty to discharge our internationalobligations by acceding to most of the relevantagreements and treaties  such as the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which Burkina Faso hassigned and ratified. I should like to take thisopportunity to encourage other countries to do likewisein order to speed up the coming into force of that legalinstrument  whose importance for world peace andstability is fully evident.I hardly need recall that the current session’sleitmotif is the democratization of the United Nations.It is therefore rather difficult to understand how we cancontinue to disregard the rights of 23 millionTaiwanese people. The time has come to deal justlywith that people  which for decades now hasdemonstrated its commitment to democracy  peace andinternational solidarity.Today more than ever  the fate of humankind is inour hands. Moving in concert  in the same directionand inspired by the same principles  we must assumeour new common responsibility: to build a world inlarger freedom  with development  security and dignityfor all."
"16",640,"BGD",60,2005,"I wish to congratulateyou  Mr. President  on your election. I am confidentthat you will carry forward the able legacy left by yourpredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping. Our warm tribute is alsodue to the Secretary-General as he strives toreinvigorate our Organization.We meet in the wake of the High-level PlenaryMeeting  where bold decisions were made to promoteimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.Our problems transcend national boundaries. Solutionsneed a global consensus. All of us must emphaticallyreaffirm the central role of the United Nations in thecooperative management of the worldís problems.We are constitutionally committed to uphold theCharter and its legitimacy based on the rule of law. In aglobalizing world  no nation is an island. None canprosper alone. The United Nations remains the onlybastion of peace  justice and development in the world.Reform of the United Nations is vital. We mustfocus on its effectiveness and ability to deliver quickly.Its agenda and mandate must be meaningful. Itsadministration must be reformed. Its budget must bepurged of waste. Its major organs need to bereconstituted and revitalized to serve purposefulpriorities. Expansion of its major organs is necessarybut must be tailored to the efficacy of the Organization.The dynamics of todayís world have been createdby immense forces of change. Among them areadvances in science and technology and widespreadawareness of individual rights. The resultingglobalization and progression of humanitarian law havegiven rise to a world where the very concept ofsovereignty is being challenged  where the dimensionsof security are in a flux  where the nature of conflicthas seen a seismic shift and where social exclusion hasadded complex uncertainty. The need for constructiveengagement  dialogue  tolerance and understanding isimperative. Development and the rule of law must takecentre stage.New challenges confront us today. Whileterrorists sow panic and xenophobia in our societies deprivation  hunger  disease and environmentaldegradation continue to fuel insecurity anddestabilization. The recent bombings in London andEgypt shocked us all. They have hardened our resolveto face this menace unitedly. Bangladesh condemnsterrorism in all its forms. We have acceded to all anti-terrorism conventions of the United Nations andrelevant regional organizations. We support the earlyconclusion of a comprehensive United Nationsconvention on terrorism. I would like to underscore ourconviction that terrorists do not belong to any onecountry or religion.In Bangladesh  sustained efforts are being madeto pursue the twin objectives of responsibility at homeand a contribution abroad. Despite enormousconstraints  we have made good progress to advancedemocracy  development and human rights. Werecognize that those goals are linked with one another.We have moved slowly but surely to shore up ademocratic ethos. The late President Ziaur Rahman ledBangladesh out of the morass of a failed democracy in1975. He introduced a multi-party system  freed thepress and opened up the economy. In 1990  a popularuprising against an entrenched military dictatorshipbrought the first real push towards sustaineddemocracy. We have not looked back. Threeconsecutive free and fair elections have been heldunder a neutral caretaker Government. That uniqueconstitutional innovation has ensured the peacefultransfer of power on an alternating basis. Democracyhas become firmly rooted in Bangladesh. A keyelement of the last election  in 2001  was theparticipation of more than 70 per cent of the electorate.Women voters outnumbered men. They voted not forsymbols but for issues.32A quiet revolution is under way in Bangladesh inthe field of development. The progress is visible on sixkey fronts: stable growth of the gross domestic product(GDP) at a rate of 5 per cent or more for over twodecades; higher per capita income; food security;increased resilience in the face of natural disasters;improvement of the human development index; andbetter social and health outcomes. Our performance inthose areas compares favourably with the results in ourown region and elsewhere. A set of pragmatic  targetedpolicy approaches have made that progress possible.We have completed a full-fledged poverty reductionstrategy paper through an extended consultativeprocess. It sets out a road map to meet country-specificMDGs. The fundamental principle of the povertyreduction strategy paper is to promote employment-generating economic growth and to invest significantlyin priority sectors such as education  health and socialsafety-net programmes. It is a matter of somesatisfaction that Bangladesh has achieved two of theMDGs: the elimination of gender disparity in primaryand secondary schools and access to safe drinkingwater. We are close to achieving two more goals: thereduction of extreme poverty and under-five childmortality rates.Bangladesh is committed to upholding the dignityof individuals and promoting human rights. Bangladeshis a party to all United Nations human rightsconventions. We are moving steadily to strengthengood governance through strong democraticinstitutions  establish the rule of law and eliminateintolerance in our society.Deeply entrenched pockets of poverty continue toexist around the world. The most vulnerable are theleast developed countries. Their products should begranted immediate duty-free and quota-free accessglobally. As reaffirmed at Monterrey  the specificallocation of 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of the GDP ofdeveloped countries must be earmarked for officialdevelopment assistance to least developed countries.Financing for development is a critical issue.Innovative initiatives in that regard  which have beenthe subject of discussion  need to be pursued in earnest.The devastation caused by natural disastersaffects all countries  rich and poor alike. How can wemeet the challenge of effective relief  rehabilitation andreconstruction  as well as pre-disaster warning andpreparations? That continues to the responsibility ofthe United Nations.We are profoundly shocked at the huge toll ofdamage caused by Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf coastof the United States. Natural disasters do notdistinguish between rich and poor countries  and thehuman misery and suffering caused are the same. We in Bangladesh  have weathered many severe floods andcyclones  and the toll in terms of life and property hasbeen huge. We can therefore feel the torment that theaffected people have undergone  and we offer ourheartfelt sympathies. We know that the Americanpeople can overcome the disaster and move on withtheir lives.All countries  including Bangladesh  must seekways and means to contribute effectively to the UnitedNations  whether through peacemaking  peacekeepingor peacebuilding. Active participation  innovative ideasand best practices in shoring up development togethercan enhance our combined capacity to address theworldís problems  especially those that no one countrycan tackle alone. We  in Bangladesh  are particularlyproud of our contribution to peacekeeping on manysimultaneous fronts across the globe. In all  we havecontributed more than 39 000 troops to 24 missionsand are currently among the largest contributors. Sixty-seven of our blue-helmeted soldiers have died in thatcause. Our commitment to peacekeeping remainsunflinching. We also fully support the establishment ofthe Peacebuilding Commission.A priority concern for us is our close identitywith Africa. Through our peacekeeping efforts  wehave established special bonds of friendship. The NewPartnership for Africaís Development is particularlyencouraging. We believe that South-South cooperationhas specific relevance in that context.Bangladesh reaffirms its support for the earlyestablishment of a sovereign independent State inPalestine  in accordance with the relevant UnitedNations resolutions. The road map for peace in theMiddle East needs to be implemented fully andurgently.With respect to Iraq  we believe that the presentsituation should be resolved by preserving the interestsof the Iraqi people  in particular their territorialintegrity  and by ensuring the long-term peace  securityand stability of the region.Bangladeshís constitutional commitment togeneral and complete disarmament is the reason for ourprogressive support of international and regional33treaties and agreements covering all the Atomic BombCasualty Commission (ABCC) weapons. We are aparty to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty. We give precedence to human over weaponssecurity.Each year we come to the Assembly to reaffirmour faith in the United Nations. This sixtiethanniversary year is of profound significance. We mustprovide a renewed mandate to the United Nations tomeet the challenges of the new millennium ó to ridthe world of poverty and injustice  to usher in the ruleof law  to promote the cause of development  toeradicate terrorism and  above all  to promote peaceand security. We can prevail only if we act responsiblyand together. Support for the United Nations and itslegitimacy remains a paramount priority."
"17",686,"BGR",60,2005,"Icongratulate you  Mr. President  most warmly on theoccasion of your election to this important post. Thetireless support of Bulgaria for your mission will beamong the most active  and I would like to express theprofound gratitude of my country to your predecessor Mr. Jean Ping  for his remarkable work and his realcourage.Following the best traditions in Bulgarian foreignpolicy  the new Bulgarian Government is deeplyattached to the principle of multilateralism ininternational relations  and thus believes in the centralnature of the United Nations as the onlyintergovernmental organization that is completelyuniversal and extremely representative of the peoplesof the world. Bulgaria is participating in the sixtiethsession of the General Assembly as a country that hassigned the Treaty of Accession to the European Unionand acts with the status of active observer in the bodiesand institutions of the European Union. My countryhas unreservedly supported the positions of theEuropean Union during the preparatory work for thesummit that has just taken place  and we fully supportthe analysis of the outcome document made by theUnited Kingdom presidency.The main purpose of this debate is to implementthe decisions of the summit. I hope that each MemberState will help to push forward reform in the UnitedNations  as set out in the outcome document(resolution 60/1). Substantial progress has been madein many key areas  and this is a good basis for the workof the sixtieth session. However  we are obliged to notewith regret that some of the ambitious and innovativeideas in the report of the Secretary-General  “In largerfreedom” (A/59/2005)  welcomed and endorsed byBulgaria  could not be adopted. We need to redoubleour efforts so that these ideas can come to pass.Bulgaria supports the efforts of Secretary-General KofiAnnan in this respect and expresses the hope that hisvaluable contribution will continue.In parallel with the sixtieth anniversary of thecreation of the United Nations  my country is alsocelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of its membershipin the United Nations family. Over the last 50 years the challenges facing humanity have increased incomplexity and diversity  and the threats facing us tendto interweave and compound each other in a mannernever seen before. However  just as 50 years ago  it isthe human being who is at the centre of our attention asthe supreme value  the human being with his individualsecurity and his right to a life of dignity and happiness.The summit that has just concluded in New Yorkhas revived hope that the struggle to eradicate poverty hunger and epidemics and to protect the environmentcan be won. The condition is that we need to mobilizethe maximum amount of efforts and the maximumresources so that we can implement a real globalpartnership between the developed and developingcountries. We support the European Union’s position ofincreasing official development assistance.22As a candidate for membership in the Economicand Social Council for 2007 to 2009  Bulgaria hasdecided to make its contribution to activities of theUnited Nations in the social and economic areas.The summit outcome document definesHIV/AIDS as being one of the greatest threats tohumanity. Efforts of the entire international communityare required in order to counter it. Children and youngpeople are the most affected. The case of the Libyanchildren  contaminated with the HIV/AIDS virus in ahospital  is a tragedy deserving our compassion and oursupport. Bulgaria welcomes the adoption ofappropriate measures to avoid such tragedies in thefuture. It will participate actively in the EuropeanUnion’s plan of action  which it has just published aimed at limiting the consequences of the epidemic ofHIV/AIDS in Libya.My country supports the emergence of a newconsensus in the United Nations relating to the chiefthreats to international peace and security andcollective action against such threats. Bulgariacategorically condemns terrorism in all of its forms andmanifestations. No cause can justify violence againstinnocent people. The United Nations has a leading andirreplaceable role in creating a global environment ofintolerance and rejection of terrorism.For that reason  my delegation will supportunconditionally the adoption during the sixtieth sessionof an anti-terrorist strategy. It is in the context of thisstrategy that we should seek lasting and long-termsolutions to the political  economic and social causesfuelling this phenomenon. Bulgaria also insists that acommon definition of terrorism be developed  makingit possible to adopt a convention on internationalterrorism. It is clear that in order to combat terrorismeffectively we need to neutralize all ideologiesadvocating terrorism. In that respect  we activelysupport initiatives that facilitate coexistence anddialogue between different civilizations  religions ethnic groups and cultures.Bulgaria profoundly regrets that the problem ofthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destructionwas not included in the summit outcome document and we associate ourselves with the Secretary-General’s appeal to continue efforts in this priority areafor our collective security.Bulgaria has wholeheartedly supported the ideaof creating a Peacebuilding Commission since itsinception. The creation of this body is one of the mostimportant decisions of the summit. Allowing theCommission to begin its work as soon as possible willgreatly increase the ability of the United Nations toconsolidate the positive effects of peacekeepingoperations. In each specific case  the PeacebuildingCommission cannot but benefit from the contributionfrom neighbouring countries and also from interestedregional organizations.As a country in South-Eastern Europe  Bulgariahas been working tirelessly over the last few decadesfor the transformation of the potential for conflict inthe Western Balkans into good-neighbourliness cooperation and development. We are convinced thatstability and prosperity in this region are ultimatelyindissolubly linked with the European perspective forthe Western Balkans. The risks of militaryconfrontation are decreasing  and what we have seenrecently is the emergence of new forms of cooperationbetween States with the consolidation of democraticinstitutions  civil societies and rule of law in thecommon fight against organized crime and corruption.For my country such forms of cooperation are apriority also as regards the States of the region of theBlack Sea  the Caspian Sea and Central Asia.The international community is on the thresholdof a crucial decision for the future of Kosovo. Thesituation there is an example of a long and sometimespainful post-conflict settlement with the leadership ofthe United Nations  and in partnership with theEuropean Union  NATO and the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. Reaching a justand lasting solution cannot ignore European norms andvalues. It must guarantee the rights of all of theinhabitants of the region without distinction as to theirethnic origin  their religious beliefs and language. Thissolution must be based on a respect of the territorialintegrity of neighbouring countries and must contributeto regional security and stability. For Bulgaria thefuture of Kosovo lies in a unified Europe  and this canbe achieved solely through the implementation ofstandards established by the Security Council.Bulgaria supports the efforts of the Governmentand the people of Iraq on the difficult road to peace security and economic recovery. The conclusion of theconstitutional process provided for by Security Councilresolution 1546 (2004) is the sole means of achievingthis. We have no doubt that the adoption of the newIraqi constitution will make it possible to overcome23existing divisions and will be a cornerstone forconstructing an Iraqi State that is unified  democraticand guarantees the rule of law. For its part  Bulgariawill continue to give its support to the Iraqi people intheir efforts to build a democratic  completelyindependent future.Mr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran)  Vice-President  took the Chair.My country welcomes the positive trends thathave been emerging in the process of consolidating theAfghan State  which the recent parliamentary electionshave strikingly confirmed. Bulgaria will continue itscontribution to the efforts of the internationalcommunity to stabilize Afghanistan. We are continuingour assistance to the Afghan army.We agree with those who highlight the need tofocus the attention of the international community onAfrica. There is no doubt that a priority for the UnitedNations must be the settlement of regional and localconflicts on this continent  combating poverty  and thetransition to sustainable development. The role of theAfrican Union here is irreplaceable.For Bulgaria the protection and the promotion ofhuman rights are priorities of the United Nations  asare the problems of development and security. Wewelcome the decision taken by the summit to create aHuman Rights Council. In our view this Councilshould sit permanently and be elected directly by theGeneral Assembly with a set majority. Its status shouldbe higher than that of the existing Commission onHuman Rights. The role of this new body would be todevelop and improve the current practices of theCommission  particularly by regularly reviewing thestate of human rights in all countries of the world whilebeing ready to react in cases of grave and seriousviolations of human rights. In this respect Bulgariarepeats its support for the Democracy Fund  whichcould encourage the democratic process in countriesthat need it and that wish to be helped in this area. Mycountry is now evaluating its national contribution tothis Fund.Over the last few days in this Hall we have had adiscussion on the protection of human rightsworldwide. In this respect I cannot but mention a casethat is of particular concern for Bulgarian publicopinion. This involves the destiny of the five Bulgariannurses and one Palestinian doctor condemned to deathby a Libyan court in Benghazi. The innocence of theaccused has been categorically confirmed by leadingscientists in the field of HIV/AIDS. Bulgaria stillinsists that a just and fair decision be taken by theSupreme Court of Libya on 15 November.The consensus that has emerged on the concept ofthe “responsibility to protect” during the negotiationson the outcome document of the summit is a realbreakthrough. It makes possible joint action by allMembers of the United Nations in cases of genocide ethnic cleansing and other mass crimes againsthumanity when national authorities refuse to act or areunable to protect their citizens.I am convinced that we are on the threshold ofthe most important and boldest reforms of the UnitedNations in its history. Only the collective will of allMember States can open the way to real change. Thestakes are enormous: allow the United Nations toestablish its reputation as the universal worldOrganization capable of proving once again its vitalityin the face of the challenges of globalization."
"18",731,"BHR",60,2005,"It ismy pleasure to congratulate you upon your election asPresident of the General Assembly during its historicsixtieth session. I am fully confident that you will leadits deliberations towards a successful conclusion. I alsowould like to express my appreciation for thecontribution of the Foreign Minister of Gabon duringthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Icommend the efforts of the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  who has sought to make significantchanges to this Organization so as to make it betterable to meet the demands of the twenty-first century  asenvisaged in his report and in his recommendationsbefore this session.The historical context of the creation of ourcurrent international order  with its mechanisms andinstitutions  is a part of a world different from that oftoday. That world preceded both the cold war andsubsequent events  developments and changes inregional and international arenas. Our session this yearis  in essence  an important moment in the progress ofinternational collective efforts  prompting us today toseek a new vision and to find systems that are betterdeveloped in both their means and structures  in orderto address contemporary dangers and threats  as well asrapid world changes.The world today is witnessing many changes thatare due to the interdependence of States and to variousfacts  balances and dangers around the world. As aresult  we are obliged to revisit the internationalcollective security system  to thoroughly study theconcepts and structures of the United Nations and toprovide creative initiatives to address such matters inthe twenty-first century spirit of modernity. HisHighness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad bin IsaAl-Khalifa  the Crown Prince  underlined this issue inhis address on behalf of His Majesty King Hamad binIsa Al-Khalifa  King of Bahrain  before the High-levelMeeting of the General Assembly on 15 September2005.These might be the urgent needs that promptedthe Secretary-General to crystallize all this in a seriesof initiatives and meetings at the beginning of the thirdmillennium  by announcing suggestions for themillennium and its development goals. In his importantreport to this session  entitled “In larger freedom”(A/59/2005)  the Secretary-General explained hisvision in a comprehensive and in-depth manner  alongwith the bases and aims of the work of the internationalorder of our world today. Based on this order we canmove towards a modern  capable and democraticsystem to achieve the three important types of freedom namely freedom to live in dignity  freedom from want and freedom from fear. This comprehensive vision ofthe Secretary-General on issues of internationalsecurity  development and human rights deservescommendation and thorough and deep analysis in orderto reach a broad international consensus.The dangerous escalation today in terrorism andits culture  derived from hatred and fanaticism  are themost serious dangers threatening the internationalcommunity everywhere. They require us to develop anintegrated strategy that halts terrorism and the cultureof death and violence that terrorism advocates. Thisalso re-emphasizes the common responsibility of Statesand societies to find a means to address the root causesof terrorism.We must state that an effective counter-terrorismstrategy has to balance the needs of human security andadherence to international human rights instrumentsand treaties  and has to close loopholes in treatiesdealing with the phenomenon of terrorism.In this context  the Kingdom of Bahrain hascontinued its domestic efforts and its efforts in the GulfRegion with its partner Gulf Cooperation Councilcountries to fight money-laundering and the financingof terrorism in the Middle East and North Africageographically  and on the security cooperation level politically and practically. In this regard  the Kingdomof Bahrain endorses and supports the proposal of theCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques  King AbdullaBin Abdulaziz Al-Saud  King of the brotherlyKingdom of Saudi Arabia  to establish an internationalcentre to fight terrorism. The Kingdom of Bahrain has16also submitted its instruments of accession to theUnited Nations Secretariat in New York for manyconventions relating to the fight against terrorism  inaccordance with Security Council resolution 1373(2001).The greatest security challenge in the Middle Eastis not simply to end terrorism and violence; it alsoincludes the absence of a just and comprehensive peacein the Arab-Israeli conflict  which is an ongoing sourceof confrontation and a threat to stability and whichbrings despair to those who have legitimate hopes for alife of dignity and regional economic progress.We must not forget that the year 2005 has openeda path that might lead to an opportunity for peace through the positive internal developments on thePalestinian side and through Arab and internationalsupport for the new leadership of President MahmoodAbbas and his moves towards achieving peace reducing tension  and promoting democracy.We welcome the Israeli withdrawal from theGaza Strip and hope that this withdrawal will be asignificant step towards a just and comprehensivepeace in the area. We also hope that this withdrawalwill be a part of the road map plan.The achievement of security  stability and peacein the Middle East requires an end to the Israelioccupation of all Arab territories and the fullimplementation of all relevant United Nationsresolutions  as reaffirmed by the Arab initiativeadopted by the Arab Summit in Beirut in 2002. Thatwas reaffirmed once again by the latest Arab Summitheld this year in Algiers. A just and comprehensivepeace cannot be achieved  except through the end ofthe Israeli occupation of the Arab territories occupiedsince 1967  including the Syrian Golan and the rest ofthe Lebanese territories  through the return ofPalestinian refugees and through the establishment ofthe Palestinian State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as itscapital.Notwithstanding the democratic choice of theIraqi people in the elections last January and theappointment of a transitional Government and in spiteof the steps taken during the political process and thepreparation of the draft constitution  the situation inIraq today remains very delicate and sensitive. Itrepresents a challenge to international and regionalsecurity. It threatens not only the security of Iraq andthe region  but also Iraq’s unity  its territorial integrity cohesion and the consensus of its people.Overcoming this dilemma can be achieved onlythrough a strong historical national consensus on Iraq’sterritorial integrity and ethnic diversity  acomprehensive political process and participation inshaping the future of Iraq. This national consensusalone is the guarantee for Iraq to overcome its currentpredicament and to move from this difficult ordeal toan era of stability  security and peace.In this context  the Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirmsits support for the Iraqi people and calls upon all tocontinue regional and international support for Iraq inorder that it may fulfil its responsibilities towards itspeople and the Arab nation as a whole.In the context of regional security in the Gulfregion  the peaceful settlement  either throughnegotiations or international arbitration  of the longdispute between the United Arab Emirates and itsbrother  the Islamic Republic of Iran  regarding thethree Emirate islands  especially now that there is anew Iranian leadership  will enable the Gulf region todivert its efforts and natural resources to face thechallenges of development  security  peace andcooperation.In the area of development and progress  theKingdom of Bahrain has followed a policy ofopenness  reform and participation and democracyenhancement  moving towards social  cultural and civilmodernization that goes hand in hand with our culture deep-rooted traditions and values.In the context of its efforts to fulfil theMillennium Development Goals  the Kingdom ofBahrain has taken significant steps to enable women toassume positions of leadership in various walks of life by launching a new national strategy to promoteBahraini women. Accordingly  in putting forward itscandidature for the presidency of the forthcomingsixty-first session of the General Assembly  it hasselected a capable person who represents Bahrainiwomen  and who demonstrates experience  wisdom anddiplomatic skill. We hope that this nomination willreceive wide agreement among Member States.Reaffirming its regional and international statusas an economic  financial and banking centre and aspart of its efforts to attract greater investment andcapital  create employment opportunities for its17citizens and strengthen the national economy  theKingdom of Bahrain has embarked on many majoreconomic and investment projects that will strengthenand enhance the economic and trade position ofBahrain at the regional and international levels.Efforts and initiatives have continued over manydecades to achieve a collective security system thatwill free humanity from the dangers of destruction andannihilation by prohibiting the proliferation of nuclearweapons. However  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has not achieved its goals despite accessionby the majority of countries of the world  including allArab countries. In this regard  we call upon theinternational community to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in both the Middle East and the Gulf region.We hope that sincere and concerted efforts willcontinue among Member States to reach a consensuson the reform of the Organization.We trust that the framework of the proposedexpansion of the Security Council will reflect theconsensus of Member States with a clear and realisticvision and will take into account the interests andexpectations of the Arab nations with their profoundinfluence on the political stability  economy  peace andsecurity in the whole world.The recommendations put forward by theSecretary-General in his report “In larger freedom”(A/59/2005) represent comprehensive and ambitiousviews and aspirations in relation not only to theSecurity Council  which is entrusted by the Charterwith the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  but also to establishing the basis for the entireinternational system.We all look forward  during this session  to theopening of historic negotiations on the reforms ofUnited Nations organs as well as on working methods.The Kingdom of Bahrain supports the United Nationsreform initiative and believes in the necessity ofcontinued negotiations and discussions among MemberStates in order to reach the results that we all aspire to.The world today  this post-cold-war world  is notyet free of the scourge of war  and its people are stillvulnerable to the consequences of terrorism andviolence.Today  we urgently need a more modern stronger  reinvigorated and more credible Organization:an Organization that will bring all nations together andbalance their interests  resolve conflicts  build peaceand security  uphold justice and the rule of law  obligeall to abide by the provisions of the Charter andinternational legal resolutions  adapt to the changes ofthe twenty-first century and meet successfully itschallenges.We look forward to a reformed United Nations which we hope will come into existence soon."
"19",769,"BHS",60,2005,"It is my honour tocongratulate you on your election to the presidency ofthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly. I alsowish to pay tribute to the tireless efforts of yourpredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  for the manner in which heguided the work of the fifty-ninth session.I wish to extend the condolences of the RightHonourable Prime Minister of the Commonwealth ofthe Bahamas  Perry Christie  and the Government andpeople of the Bahamas to the Government and peopleof the United States in the aftermath of HurricaneKatrina last month. This is a scene with which thepeople of the Bahamas are regrettably all too familiar and we continue to offer our assistance and support inany way possible.The High-level Plenary Meeting held last week at which so many heads of State and Government wererepresented  served as a timely and much-neededreminder of the need for us all to recommit ourselvesto the purposes and principles of this Organization. Ata time when some have begun to question the purposeof this Organization  the Bahamas reaffirms that theUnited Nations remains the best chance for all States large and small  to achieve peace  security andsustainable development for our peoples.One of the leaders who spoke last week was theMost Honourable P. J. Patterson  Prime Minister ofJamaica. On April of 2006  Mr. Patterson demits officeafter more than a decade in the service of his peopleand the Caribbean region as Prime Minister  and ageneration as a parliamentarian and GovernmentMinister. His statement last week was perhaps his finalstatement to this Assembly as Prime Minister. TheBahamas - and the region joins us  I am sure -salutes Mr. Patterson as he retires from active publiclife.Mr. Pattersonís example in Jamaica is one that weknow well enough in the Caribbean region. It is theexample of democratic governance and the traditionsof regular elections and accountability to the publicswhom we serve. The history of democracy in ourregion has also produced for the region an enviablestandard of living in many ways. This way of life hasbeen described by the Prime Minister of Saint Vincentand the Grenadines  The Honourable Ralph Gonsalves as the ""Caribbean civilization"" - one that did notdevelop without significant investment in our peopleand that cannot be sustained unless that investmentcontinues.The region is neither poor nor rich. It falls inbetween  having accomplished most if not all of theMillennium Development Goals. But as we watch thedevelopment of globalization  there is a tendency toforget that this region of relatively few people andsmall nations requires the continued support of thedeveloped world. Nowhere is this more evident than inthe decisions taken on sugar and bananas. There is asymbiotic relationship between the region and thedeveloped world  with many of our people leaving theregion to help to sustain the way of life of thedeveloped world. There is a major transformation rightnow in economies throughout the region.Our view is that greater attention from ourdeveloped partners must therefore be paid to thatregion in transition  looking towards investment particularly in education  support for the delivery ofhealth care and continued support for democraticgovernance. It is not charity that is required  but asound  sensible investment in our common future.Haiti is our poorest member in the region and isperhaps the example from which it is best to drawlessons. We want to thank Brazil and the many sistercountries of Latin America that have risen to thechallenge with men and materiel. But while much hasbeen given  there are many pledges of donor aid thathave not materialized as they should. It is a complaintthroughout the developing world that donors makepledges of financial and material support but do notfollow through on those pledges.Haiti today is paying the price in a real way forhaving charted the way towards freedom in thishemisphere when  in 1804  it struck a blow for thefreedom of Africans in the West. Today  we repeatwhat the American Christian Bishop  T. D. Jakes  said5in the National Cathedral in Washington last weekwhen praying for the victims of Hurricane Katrina: it iswhat we do that counts  but what we say we will do.Haiti is of major interest to us in the Bahamas because  given the circumstances of its economy andits national politics  the Bahamas and the region arefacing increased pressure from illegal migration fromHaiti and the threat of instability. It is incumbent uponall of us in the United Nations to do all that we can tohelp resolve the issues in Haiti.It is also important that we not overlook issues ofglobal governance and institutional reform. It would benearly impossible for small States  in particular  tosustain meaningful gains from the process ofglobalization without a voice and without participationin international decision-making and norm-settingbodies. It is for that reason that the Bahamas isencouraged by the discussions that took place duringthe high-level dialogue on financing for development held earlier this year  which confirmed that there is aplace for the United Nations in all aspects of globalstandard-setting and assessment. The dialogue clearlydemonstrated that there is a need to address thedemocratic deficit in many of the internationaleconomic  financial and trade institutions.From this rostrum last year  the Bahamas calledfor the convening of a global forum to address theunfairness of unelected bodies imposing mandates thatare unfunded upon developing economies like ours inthe region  without our countries having an opportunityto be heard and to influence the result. We call onceagain for such a forum  and pledge that the Bahamaswill continue to work towards levelling the playingfield  particularly in the financial services sector.The images of destruction in the aftermath ofHurricane Katrina are all too familiar to many smallisland developing States. The images have beensobering  as we realize that even the biggest andstrongest of us has to grapple with the difficultiesassociated with the recovery from such a destructiveforce of nature. Last year in this Hall  we said that thenative peoples of our region were so familiar with theviolent storms that plague the region in the summermonths that they called them hurricanes. Today  we areseeing those storms hit with a savagery unknown inrecent times. It leads us to question whether we arenow being confronted by cyclical change or by climatechange. Either case places front and centre the need forpublic policy on sustainable development and theimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy for smallisland developing States.The Bahamas  much of whose land is barely fivefeet above mean sea level  wishes to highlight the needto undertake global action to address the problems ofclimate change. With the warming of the Earth'ssurfaces and oceans  we have seen an increase in theincidence of natural disasters  many of them causinguntold loss and damage. We have an opportunity however  to address the adverse effects of climatechange. We have a chance to make a statement hereduring this session that we will not neglect ourcommon but differentiated responsibility to protect ourenvironment and to send this message to Montreal where  in November this year  the Kyoto Protocol canfinally begin to take on a more substantial form.For countries such as the Bahamas  the threat ofdevastation as a result of natural disasters isexacerbated by man-made hazards. We once againreiterate our grave concern about the serious threatposed to the security and economic development ofCaribbean countries by the trans-shipment of nuclearwaste through the Caribbean Sea  and continue to callon States involved in such trans-shipments to desistfrom that practice. In this context  I wish to highlightthe continuing efforts of the Caribbean region todesignate the Caribbean Sea a special area in thecontext of sustainable development.The achievement of sustainable development willrequire healthy  productive populations that are ableboth to contribute to and benefit from social andeconomic progress. The unrelenting spread ofHIV/AIDS continues to threaten that progress in allcountries  but particularly in the hardest hit developingcountries. The Bahamas is a leader in the fight againstHIV/AIDS in the Caribbean region  and has beenrecognized at the international level for the progressmade in turning the tide against that disease in ourcountry. We pay tribute to Dr. Perry Gomez  our leadphysician in the fight against HIV/AIDS and  indeed to my predecessor at this rostrum  Mr. Denzil Douglasfrom Saint Kitts and Nevis  as well as to all the othercaregivers throughout the world. We welcome thisbody's reaffirmation at the highest levels of the fightagainst that disease.In this context  the Bahamas looks forward to thehigh-level five-year review of the progress made in6implementation of the Declaration of Commitment onHIV/AIDS  scheduled to take place in June 2006. Atthat time we must undertake an honest appraisal ofwhat we have achieved and where we are failing short and we must determine the way forward towardsachieving the full implementation of the Declaration ofCommitment.In addition  the Bahamas has seen useful ideasadvanced by the United States of America  the WorldHealth Organization and the Pan American HealthOrganization  to prevent a bird flu pandemic. Wewould like to take this opportunity to alert the worldthat we must fight to stop such an eventuality  andpledge our support in doing so.By virtue of its geographical location  theBahamas is an unwitting transit point for illegal drugsfrom producing countries south of our borders toconsumer countries to the north. We have consistentlypointed out that the Bahamas does not produce suchsubstances and is not the ultimate destination for them.That  however  does not stop the countries thatconsume the drugs from blaming countries like ours forthe scourge. It is very unfair to do so. It is clear thatconsuming nations must increase their efforts to reducedemand within their borders. We continue to cooperatewith the United States and other countries in thatinternational fight. Our successful efforts and those ofthe broader region have been acknowledged by ourinternational partners in the fight. I should like tomention in particular the admirable performance of theBahamas in its counter-narcotics effort and the superbrecord of our country's police in terms of dismantlingdrug-trafficking organizations  as well as our hardwork to improve the country's ability to combatmoney-laundering. It is a fight that we pledge tocontinue.The Bahamas  like other transit countries  isexperiencing the negative social impact of illegalactivities associated with that trade. The deadly nexusbetween illicit drugs and small arms and light weaponsand other criminal activities is undermining theeconomic and social fabric of our nation. We thereforewelcome the conclusion in June of the work of theOpen-ended Working Group on the marking andtracing of small arms and light weapons. The Bahamas like many other countries  would have stronglypreferred to reach agreement on legally bindingcommitments on the marking and tracing of suchweapons. Nonetheless  we hope that this tool willprovide some of the necessary political will andmomentum to make real progress in halting the illicitaccumulation and spread of small arms and lightweapons. We also look forward to adopting concretecommitments in the near future to regulate theactivities of brokers of small arms and light weapons.In addition  the Bahamas continues to call ondeveloped countries to take the same extraordinarymeasures they use in seeking to stop the trafficking ofdrugs into their countries to stop illegal arms fromreaching our shores from their countries.The Bahamas is pleased to note the adoption bythe General Assembly on 13 April 2005 of theInternational Convention for the Suppression of Actsof Nuclear Terrorism. We hope to be in a position tosign the Convention in the near future. We are resolutein the fight against the attacks on innocent peoplegoing about their daily lives by those pursuing dubiousand nefarious political ends. The vicious attacks inLondon and Sharm el-Sheikh this year demonstrateclearly the urgency of our task.However  we must also remember that the fightagainst those who would attack our commoncivilization can never be used as an excuse to curtailthe rights and freedoms of our citizens  and we mustensure that all counter-measures must conform to boththe letter and the spirit of international human rightslaw. If we lose our common humanity in the process the other side will win. We must also ensure that aspirit of cooperation and assistance permeates ourinternational cooperation efforts on this issue  as weunite to fight a common enemy.Over the past year  various issues related to themanagement of United Nations programmes and fundshave been highlighted in the world media. OurOrganization has been plagued by allegations ofcorruption and abuse. Therefore  during the monthsleading up to the present session  the Bahamaswelcomed the opportunity to engage constructively inconsultations to ensure a successful outcome on thequestion of management reform of the Organization.We reaffirm our support for the Secretary-General withrespect to the bold measures that he promised in hisreport entitled ""In larger freedom"" (A/59/2005)  andwe believe that he should be given the necessary levelof authority and flexibility to fulfil his function as ourchief executive officer. However  that is not to say thatwe support those proposals from other quarters thatwould seek to transfer power from the General7Assembly to the Secretary-General in matters such asthe redeployment of resources. The General Assemblyis and should remain the principal policy organ of theUnited Nations  with absolute powers in the area ofsetting priorities. The Bahamas also looks forward tocontinuing discussions on the reform of the SecurityCouncil  particularly in relation to the Councilísworking methods.Let me take this opportunity to thank Mr. KofiAnnan for his fine work in leading the United Nationsthrough treacherous seas over the past years. We willshortly celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the signingof the Charter of the United Nations. Looking backover the past 60 years  there is much of which we canjustifiably be proud. There are some cases where wemust accept that the international community failed tolive up to its legal and moral obligation to act for thebenefit of people in need. There are some cases whereour decisions were dominated by big-Powerpragmatism and doubtful legalisms  as opposed tomoral certainty and philosophical clarity.As we move forward  let us be sure that we learnfrom our mistakes as well as our successes. We haveengaged in a process of reflection  which at times hasbeen painful. Let us emerge from this stronger  moreunified and determined to act to achieve the goalsadopted 60 years ago to promote social progress andbetter standards of life in larger freedom. The peoplesof our nations demand and deserve nothing less. Now more than ever  we need the United Nations."
"20",794,"BIH",60,2005,"Atthe outset  allow me to express my great pleasure inattending this sixtieth session of the General Assemblyand in addressing you on behalf of the Council ofMinisters of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I should alsolike to congratulate you  Mr. President  on yourelection and at the same time to express my sincereappreciation to Mr. Jean Ping for his successfulpresiding over the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly.Let me start by making reference to the historicsummit that took place last week. In its sixtieth year ofstriving for global peace  the United Nations hasreached maturity. Our planet is not what it was 60years ago  and we will leave it to historians to saywhether our generation is better than earliergenerations.We need to be able to face the challenges ofglobalization in the twenty-first century armed withcapacity and competence. We need to showmultilateralism and cooperation  relying on the basicvalues outlined in the Charter. Above all  we need toidentify explicit obligations and ensure that they arefulfilled. The United Nations  unique and uncontestedwhen it comes to global credibility and capacity should not be content to be simply what it used to be.This Organization needs to be reformed  not only toquiet the criticism but also more importantly to earnunequivocal respect.The strength and efficiency of the UnitedNations  like in any other organization  depend on thecollective strength of its Members. Its strength stemsfrom the unity of the Member States. OurOrganization  as imperfect as it is  reflects today'sworld  the international community and our entiregeneration. The High-level Plenary Meeting's outcomedocument is encouraging because it summarizes theissues on which we reached consensus  but it has fallenshort of providing the timeframe and methods forachieving important goals.2It is a pity that reform of the Security Council haslost momentum and has been postponed to the future.Our enthusiasm in supporting the establishment of theHuman Rights Council was overshadowed by the factthat the final document has not defined the modalitiesfor realizing this idea in a precise timeframe. Westrongly urge the appointment of a facilitator who willstreamline the General Assembly's efforts to see thisnewborn get on its feet.As for the responsibility to protect  which foundits rightful place in the outcome document  we wouldlike to point out the paramount role of preventivediplomacy. From our painful experience we have cometo realize the importance of fact-finding missions andearly warning systems for potential or imminentconflicts.In order to have efficient early warning  we needto strengthen the Secretariat's Department of PoliticalAffairs. Staff from countries emerging from conflict orfrom post-conflict societies  staff with first-handexperience could be an asset to that Department. Thatwould allow us to restore the credibility of the UnitedNations  which was in great part overshadowed by non-government organizations such as the InternationalCrisis Group.Having travelled the path from being the subjectof Security Council emergency meetings to being apotential candidate for a non-permanent seat on theSecurity Council in 2010-2011  Bosnia andHerzegovina strongly supports the outcome document'sconclusion that the Council should stay committed toits primary responsibility under the Charter andmaintain international peace and security  rather thanexpand its agenda at the expense of the GeneralAssembly.Another of today's serious challenges  one thatBosnia and Herzegovina is dealing with quitesuccessfully  is the war on terrorism. It is certain that aglobal threat requires a global response  and that ispossible only through the United Nations. Thedefinition of terrorist acts  the unequivocalcondemnation of such acts by the internationalcommunity  the identification of means of internationalcooperation in the fight against terrorism and theunhindered functioning of international justice can beachieved only through the United Nations. A specialMinistry for Security has been established in Bosniaand Herzegovina  aimed not only at improvingdomestic security but also at contributing moreeffectively to the global fight against terrorism. Theanti-terrorist team that operates under this Ministry hasalready blocked the bank accounts of suspectindividuals and organizations and has brought anumber of charges. We have signed all the internationalconventions against terrorism  and we stand ready tomake a constructive contribution to the drafting theUnited Nations Comprehensive Convention onTerrorism  as agreed in the outcome document.The summit's accomplishments are quiteencouraging  demonstrating the power of universalismand multilateralism and their superiority overunilateralism. We made this Assembly an arena ofagreement  instead of an arena of conflict. The lessonlearned in Bosnia and Herzegovina has taught us that ifwe find enough strength and courage in ourselves toprove our commitment to these principles in practice the course of history can be changed towards peace stability and prosperity for all.With no intention to go too far into the past orinterpret facts that already belong to the archives  Imust remind you that we are marking two anniversariesthis year: Srebrenica and Dayton. The close to 8 000names of Bosniacs on the list in the Srebrenica reportconfirm the terrible truth about the genocide that tookplace in that city. That crime was committed 50 yearsafter the liberation of Auschwitz  when it was vowedthat that would never again happen. Yet it happenedagain: not once but twice. We now have the power andinstruments to prevent anything similar from everhappening again.The Dayton Agreement  the peace agreement thatwas reached in Dayton and signed in Paris and oftencriticized for its complicated and unfeasible provisions did stop the war and enabled freedom of movement. Itmeant a new beginning for Bosnia and Herzegovina.However imperfect  it provided the framework thatenabled us  10 years down the line  to turn the situationaround and complete fundamental reforms that havebecome part of our everyday life  namely  the creationof a single defence system with a Ministry of Defence the unification of two economic spaces  the merger oftwo intelligence services  a single Customs service andrevenue system  standardization  to mention but a few.Obvious limitations imposed by the Daytonframework  for example the problems faced in policereform  will be dealt with in accordance with3international standards  just as we did with defencereform. International standards and good democraticpractices will take us to the future  free of fear andtension. We believe that the road that Bosnia andHerzegovina is resolutely following provides animportant international experience. Peace is now firmand the State reintegrated  as the situation in Bosniaand Herzegovina clearly shows.We have done more in terms of integration andnation building over the past three years than in theprevious seven. I would like to bring to your attentionthe important fact that the international affirmation ofBosnia and Herzegovina and fulfilment of ourobligations are interconnected. There is a correlationbetween encouragement and obligations on the oneside and multiple reforms on the other.A key feature of all reforms to date is the fact thatthey have all been implemented through politicalagreement. They were not a result of internationalpressure and they were not imposed by the currentHigh Representative. Entities have agreed to transfertheir jurisdictions to the State. Establishing andrunning the State-level Ministry of Defence was acrucial step forward in terms of NATO's Partnershipfor Peace programme. Numerous institutions andagencies in the field of public health now operate withState-level mandates as well. We are in the final phasesof introducing a single-rate value-added tax in Bosniaand Herzegovina  which will strengthen andaccommodate the business environment for foreigninvestment. We have recorded continued growth inforeign direct investment over the past two years whereas growth in the gross domestic product for 2004was almost 6 per cent ó a record for our region.Of course  one of our most importantinternational obligations is cooperation with theInternational Criminal Tribunal for the FormerYugoslavia (ICTY)  and we pay a great deal ofattention to it. Despite the fact that the RepublikaSrpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina has also madesubstantial progress in this area this year  we arediscouraged by the fact that the two most wanted warcriminals have not yet been brought to justice. Obviousimprovement in cooperation with The Hague  suddenvoluntary surrenders to the Tribunal after years ofhiding and the locations from which runaway criminalsare being extradited clearly point to the level ofresponsibility of Serbia and Montenegro with regard tothis entire matter  especially as compared to theresponsibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We areextremely concerned by the fact that many criminalsstill at large have obviously used Belgrade as an escaperoute and to secure hideouts outside the region.The reform of the justice system has resulted inthe establishment of the institutions of StateProsecutor  the National Court and the High Judicialand Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina.We are the first country in the region to meet theinternational standards required for the processing ofwar crimes cases. The State-level Council will operateunder optimal technical conditions and in accordancewith the best European practices.The process of organizing trials in the countrieswhere crimes have been committed is somewhathindered by the dual citizenship issue. However  wehope to have that matter resolved shortly  with theassistance of the relevant international institutions.Acting in accordance with its internationalobligations  Bosnia and Herzegovina supports allactivities and peace initiatives aimed at conflictprevention  peacebuilding and safety in post-conflictzones. Despite our limited capacities  Bosnia andHerzegovina participates in international peacekeepingoperations. We have military observers in Congo Cyprus  Ethiopia and Eritrea  as well as civilian policeofficers in Liberia and Haiti as part of United Nationsoperations there. We also sent a mine-clearance team toIraq as a sign of our support for Iraqis in the process ofestablishing a democratic State.With regard to the situation in Iraq  we arepleased to see consensus among members of theSecurity Council in connection with the transfer ofauthority from the occupation forces to the legitimatelyelected judicial and executive authorities  as that willled to establishing Iraq as a sovereign and democraticcountry. That is a necessary precondition for thebeginning of comprehensive reforms of the Iraqi Stateand society.Reconstruction will still remain the key issue forIraq's citizens. The United Nations should play a moreimportant role in that connection. The Organizationprovides humanitarian aid to Iraq and is helping torebuild its infrastructure and Government institutions.The firm determination of the Members of the UnitedNations to assist in establishing stability and securityby participating in reconstruction and providing4assistance in the form of human resources or technicalsupport is vital.Bosnia and Herzegovina supports thecomprehensive implementation of the Programme ofAction adopted at the United Nations Conference onthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons inAll Its Aspects.We have also supported the outcome of thespecial session of the General Assembly devoted toAIDS by creating a special national council for theprevention of AIDS. The council will meet all requiredinternational obligations in that area by the end of thisyear.With regard to the financing of internationalpeacekeeping operations  we are quite aware that thatissue is key to accomplishing the goals of the UnitedNations. We also recognize that a shortfall in funds canindeed hinder the protection of human lives. We callfor a more balanced and fair basis for contributions.We also call upon developed countries to set a goodexample for other countries as they need todemonstrate clearly that we all share this obligation.Being an underrepresented country at UnitedNations Headquarters  and in the United Nationssystem overall  we would like to see more balancedrepresentation. Bosnia and Herzegovina is keen to seeits nationals being selected for high-ranking positionsin the Organization  as we in fact have high-qualitypersonnel to offer.On behalf of the citizens of Bosnia andHerzegovina  allow me to take this opportunity to onceagain express the gratitude that we feel for theassistance that the international community hasprovided us during times of hardship.The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina willtake immediate steps to prepare  by the end of nextyear  a national strategy to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. That strategy will include specialemphasis on transparency  good governance  betteremployment and better use of domestic resources.Lastly  allow me to share a final thought. Webelieve that helping underdeveloped countries andpost-conflict societies is not charity  but rather aninvestment in the future of the entire world."
"21",841,"BLR",60,2005,"Thesummit of our leaders is over. Each of us here at theGeneral Assembly has different feelings about it. Mine I must say  are anxiety and hope. I am anxious notabout the future of the United Nations as anOrganization — its existence  after all  is not an end initself — but about what the future of the UnitedNations holds.I place my hope in the future of the UnitedNations  because the present does not evoke unbridledoptimism. There is but one source of optimism for allof us: that the summit  just finished  may serve as awake-up call for us.Ernest Hemingway  an American who lived inEurope  evoked John Donne  who wrote  “never sendto know for whom the bell tolls  it tolls for thee”. Thisturned out to be appallingly apt. Hemingway’s “ForWhom the Bell Tolls” was written in the late 1930s andis set at the time and in the country where Guernicawas destroyed. It is no coincidence that a depiction ofthat destruction hangs outside the Security CouncilChamber. We all know what happened afterwards:from the ruins of the world the United Nationsemerged.Belarus is not a doomsayer. Indeed  we ourselvesexperienced the utter horror of the Second World Warin greater measure than anyone else and we do notwant to see it repeated. But during the sixtiethanniversary year of the victory and of the founding ofthe United Nations  it is quite appropriate to recallthese things.I do not want to state the obvious: that the UnitedNations is the Organization of all States  large andsmall  rich and poor. In this Organization everyone hasequal rights and all work together to create the mainproduct: peace. Yet I have to mention this becauseunder the banner of reform there is a move to turn ourOrganization — de facto and de jure — into aninstrument for the domination of some States by others.We all have witnessed this.A short while ago it was officially proposed thatwe approve a new decision-making procedure for thespecialized agencies: those who pay more would havemore votes. Now it is being proposed that we electmembers to the main human rights body of the UnitedNations on the basis of subjective criteria. This is adangerous trend  and a deviation from the UnitedNations Charter. It will lead to the splintering of theUnited Nations.Does the United Nations really need reformwhich creates preconditions for the more frequent andmore arbitrary use of force at the sole discretion of themighty? We are against reform which would turn theOrganization created out of the ashes of the SecondWorld War into an instrument of diktat by the militarilyand economically most powerful States. Does the17United Nations need reform which would dividecountries into those “worthy” and those “unworthy” ofinternational assistance  into pupils and teachers inmatters of governance and social development? We donot want such reform.To preserve and build upon the core values of theUnited Nations Charter  taking into account therealities of today  is the major task of genuine reformthat our Organization really needs. The diversity ofroutes to progress is among those core values. At thesummit  the President of the Republic of Belarusstressed that this can ensure the stability of the worldand is an enduring value of our civilization (seeA/60/PV.5). In today’s unipolar world  this value is notonly belittled but challenged as well.What is behind the calls we heard in this Hall lastweek to “help those who wish to help themselves”? Inpractice this is a selective approach which recognizesthe right to development only for those countries whichhave adopted government and economic reforms inaccordance with a strictly defined model. Let usconsider whether we need to clone this model theworld over. Does it represent the strength and the valueof our civilization? Does it represent the value of theUnited Nations? What can this one-sided world give topeople? Will it be a comfortable home for ourchildren?Today  as never before  we need to take an honestlook at our world  which would allow us to discusscritical problems in a free and transparent manner andto look together for ways to solve them.An honest look at today’s world  for instance would not allow us to overlook the problem oftrafficking in human beings. This disgrace of thetwenty-first century has overtaken all regions of theworld. The most vulnerable — women and children whose protection should be the priority task of theUnited Nations — serve as living merchandise. Forcedadolescent labour  the sexual enslavement of womenand girls and trafficking in human organs should bedecisively opposed by all States and prohibited in theirlegislation.There is much to do in this sphere. Today  afterall  fewer than half of Member States have ratified theProtocol to Prevent  Suppress and Punish Traffickingin Persons  Especially Women and Children. Just overa dozen countries have adopted national strategies oraction plans to combat trafficking in human beings.But it will be possible to turn this social evil back onlythrough a universal effort. In that respect  we considerit extremely important that all parties involved in thatcriminal trade be held responsible  including theconsumers of those human commodities. It is high timefor us to launch a decisive and organized campaign atthe United Nations against all forms of trafficking inand exploitation of human beings  and to forge a globalpartnership against slavery and trafficking in humanbeings in the twenty-first century.Looking honestly at today’s world we cannotignore the long-term effects of the Chernobyl disaster.The largest manmade disaster of the twentieth century it has negatively impacted on the lives of millions ofpeople and caused enormous economic damage. InBelarus alone  the disaster caused US$ 235 billion indamages. The Government of Belarus hasaccomplished much in the years since the disaster tominimize its effects. Now the time has come to assessthe effectiveness of international assistance in that areaand to chart the priorities for our joint work for thecoming decade. Those are the issues that will be on theagenda of the international conference on theChernobyl disaster to be held in April 2006 in Minsk.We call on Member States and all those who care aboutthe fate of the millions of Chernobyl victims to supportthe Assembly’s adoption of the draft resolution onChernobyl. Finally  we propose the convening of aspecial meeting of the General Assembly on 26 April2006 to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of theChernobyl tragedy.Belarus is a country that is used to relying onitself. We are not seeking any unfair internationaladvantages nor do we follow anyone else’s politicallead. We have confidence in the strength  talent anddiligence of our people. That is what allows us to speakand act in a principled and honest fashion in theinternational arena  without reference to the wishes ofthe powerful.It is precisely for that reason that we stand for anopen and honest dialogue at the United Nations. This isour common home. Here  the same simple unconditional and clear principle should apply for allcountries: equal among equals. The future of theUnited Nations rests on that. Belarus is ready to workwith everyone to make that future happen."
"22",876,"BLZ",60,2005,"We congratulate thePresident of the General Assembly on the assumptionof his office. His extensive experience in multilateralaffairs will undoubtedly be an invaluable asset in ourwork.The 2005 world summit has clearly demonstratedthat  in five years  we have not given povertyeradication the highest priority on our internationalagenda.It is clear that in too many countries theMillennium Development Goals will not be realized; insome  the situation is worse than five years ago. Howthen do we assure the marginalized people of our worldthat we are serious about achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals by the year 2015? The only way isby showing that there is the global political will to usethe outcome document as a platform for action.In his report “In larger freedom”  Kofi Annanstressed that the priority objectives of the UnitedNations over the coming years should be to secure forpeople “freedom from want” and “freedom from fear”.What is often not recognized is that a person who is notfree from want can only live in fear.The greatest evil — the most effective andconsuming terrorism of our age — is the terrorism ofabject poverty. It is a poverty in which millions ofpeople live in terror because they know that sooner  not10later  they might die from hunger or from preventablediseases.Every day in our region of Central America andthe Caribbean  our people face threats to their humansecurity: from AIDS  drug trafficking  trafficking inhuman persons  crushing poverty and growinginequality.A new security approach is therefore required tocontain these threats. We must promote thehumanization of security rather than embark on effortsto militarize globalization. We must focus on stoppingthe deaths that occur every day  most often frompreventable causes. Global security cannot be built ona minefield of poverty and disease.Prioritizing human security does not meanneglecting national sovereignty or State security. Aspart of our national security strategy  we remaincommitted to fostering a culture of peace and thepeaceful resolution of conflicts.In the Middle East  we are encouraged by theIsraeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. We join othersin calling upon the Government of Israel to continuethe withdrawal from all Palestinian territories. We lookforward to the implementation of its commitments inaccordance with the road map that will lead to therealization of two independent States  Palestine andIsrael  coexisting side by side in peace and security.The 23 million people on Taiwan also deserve tolive in peace and security. We therefore continue tourge the United Nations to take up the plea of Taiwanto participate in this world body. Taiwan has earned itsplace among the community of nations.Belize continues to be plagued by ananachronistic claim to its territory from our neighbourGuatemala. But  encouragingly  earlier this monthBelize and Guatemala signed a new agreement underthe auspices of the Organization of American States.Under that agreement  if we are unable to resolve thedispute through negotiations  the Secretary-General ofthe Organization of American States can thenrecommend that we submit our differences to aninternational juridical body. We therefore hope that wecan ensure the early and final resolution of this dispute so that we can cooperate more effectively to combatour common problems of poverty and underdevelopment.We all recognize that there can be no securitywithout development. The world summit outcomedocument maintains the vision of developmentelaborated in the Millennium Declaration  theMonterrey Consensus  the Johannesburg Plan ofImplementation and other outcomes  including theMauritius Strategy.If we are to make measurable progress indevelopment  we must urgently implement the globalpartnership for development. That global partnershipinvolves returning development issues to the forefrontof trade negotiations. Without a deeper commitmentfrom developed countries to trade regimes that aremore just  the future of the sugar and banana industriesin countries such as Belize hangs in the balance. Wemust therefore spare no effort to ensure that the latestDoha development round concludes on termsfavourable to developing countries like Belize.As a coastal nation with a significant populationin low-lying areas  my country emphasizes the need fornew action to ensure environmental sustainability particularly as it relates to climate change. We agreewith the Secretary-General that:“One of the greatest environmental anddevelopment challenges in the twenty-firstcentury will be that of controlling and copingwith climate change.” (A/59/2005  para. 60)The increased temperatures occasioned byclimate change are likely to lead to greater frequencyof life-threatening weather systems. The mostvulnerable to these changes will be small islanddeveloping States and coastal nations like Belize. It istherefore incumbent upon the international communityto improve the framework for action to cope withclimate change. The eleventh session of the Conferenceof the Parties to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change is an opportunity toforge wider and more inclusive cooperation to addressthat grave danger.So much of what we hope to achieve depends ona United Nations that is effective and credible. Somerecent reports point to systemic problems throughoutthe United Nations Organization. These  in our view provide evidence of an Organization that is flawed —not one that is irrelevant. Belize therefore continues toview the United Nations as an indispensableOrganization. It is the only global Organization thathas the capacity to meaningfully foster peace  securityand sustainable development for the peoples of ourworld.11But the United Nations must reinvent itself tomeet the needs of today’s geopolitics and unique globalchallenges. The General Assembly and the Economicand Social Council must be revitalized andstrengthened. Similarly  the Security Council must bereformed to make it more accountable  inclusive andrepresentative of the current membership of the UnitedNations.The establishment of the PeacebuildingCommission and of the Human Rights Council areimportant  but we must define ways in which thesebodies can reinforce the work of the other principalorgans of the United Nations.In the five years that have elapsed since the year2000  our collective lack of political will has resultedin the loss of millions of children  women and men tohunger  disease  HIV/AIDS and other preventablecauses. But we can halt and reverse that trend. We mustgive a reformed United Nations  as the ultimateexpression of multilateralism  the means to carry outits mandate  as set out in Article I of the Charter: “Toachieve international cooperation in solving internationalproblems of an economic  social  cultural orhumanitarian character”.Our world is besieged by such problems. We cancarry out this mandate by implementing all thecommitments we have made since the year 2000  or wecan ignore them and condemn many millions more tolive in misery or die in pain. The choice is ours."
"23",923,"BOL",60,2005,"Mr. President  I am pleased to greet and congratulateyou on your election  which will assure the success ofthese debates. I am also pleased to greet Secretary-General Kofi Annan  whose efforts to preserve peaceand promote solidarity among the world’s peoples arerecognized and appreciated.My country  Bolivia  located at the heart of SouthAmerica  has just overcome  with sacrifice anddeprivation  a profound political crisis. The maturityand the democratic spirit of my people led to atransition period to ensure institutional continuity andto initiate a process to legitimize  through a universalvote  the election of the country’s authorities.Furthermore  this process had as its goal to establishgovernability and to reaffirm faith in the citizens’ rightto elect their Government and the parliamentaryrepresentatives of their choice.During the electoral process that Bolivia ispresently undergoing  a new design for a pioneernation in securing its liberty and independence will bedefined. The elections to take place at the end of thisyear will bring about a new and unprecedentedpolitical scenario  a process to carry out a constituentassembly and the people’s decision to put into practiceregional autonomies that will lead to the establishmentof a new social contract oriented towards theconstruction of a more organized country  foreverdemocratic  without exclusion  as required by theMillennium Development Goals.A well-known Colombian citizen advised us thatonly with a new look to the past may we create thepossibility of another future; and only by lookingcreatively at our world may we catch a glimpse of thenew type of order we ought to build. This vision is5shared by the peoples of Latin America and  of course by Bolivians. For some time  we have been united inour effort to solve disputes by encouraging commonactions so that disputing countries may look for andnegotiate peaceful solutions to their differences.It is also true that in this America with profounddemocratic roots and ties of brotherhood and solidarityamong the peoples  there are still unresolved situations such as Bolivia’s landlocked status. At the beginning ofthe twenty-first century  the people of Bolivia andneighbouring countries should be capable of creatingspaces in which open dialogue can take place  withoutprejudice  thereby allowing for solutions that look tothe future and are not based on positions anchored inthe past. We believe that it is essential to enter intonegotiations with a view to consulting  responding toand serving mutual interests and reaching a definitivesolution that restores Bolivia’s sovereign access to thePacific coast. It is essential that we create anenvironment of trust for negotiation and agreement forthat purpose.Latin America is a region in which we dreamabout freedom  hope for progress and the integration ofour peoples  although this requires constant renewaland creativity on our part. I am convinced that we willcontinue with the necessary task of attaining theMillennium Development Goals set for 2015 and thesubsequent indicators for measuring social progress although in the case of Bolivia we may face difficultiesthat will require us to focus on inequality andexclusion  violent conflict  intolerance  unfair landdistribution  unemployment  extreme poverty andmalnutrition.The Bolivian people fully agree that we need tolay a foundation for ensuring progress with equity.Thus  a global effort is required if we are to eradicatepoverty.Although significant progress has been made withregard to such indicators for sustainability  institutionalimprovements and economic stability  the Governmentof Bolivia is concerned about the deadlines that havebeen set  and urges the international community toconsider putting in place better terms and conditions.Harmony among peoples cannot be achieved fullyin a world in which security is put to the test every dayby terrorist threats against innocent people and againstthe systems chosen by peoples who cherish theconviction that the only way of safeguarding mutualrespect and harmony in society is through the exerciseof democracy. Bolivia condemns terrorism and isactively combating that scourge afflicting humankind.Our Organization  which is committed topromoting the civilized coexistence of the peoples ofthe world  is 60 years old. Founded by 45 States  itnow has 191 Members  which support and put intopractice the guiding principles of our globalcommunity. A world without the United Nations isunthinkable in either theory or practice  for it isguiding us towards a common destiny and away fromsuch current tribulations as poverty  terrorism andviolence.Bolivia recognizes that  throughout the 60 yearsof this Organization’s life  it has benefited fromvaluable cooperation efforts. Indeed  certain problemsare shared by many countries. Thus internationalcooperation cannot be considered merely an act ofsolidarity. Cooperation must be a pillar of peace  sinceone of the threats that we are facing is increasinginequality leading to the marginalization of vast sectorsof our societies. This brings dissatisfaction  whichfrequently gives rise to dangerous social tensions.It is not merely a question of achieving apparenteconomic stability. Rather  we must significantlyimprove quality of life indices  both out of basicrespect for human rights and because of the need forequity and justice.Bolivia reaffirms its commitment to the principlesof the United Nations  to peace and to democraticinstitutions. We believe that the United Nations is thehighest forum for universal interaction amongcountries and individuals  and we also believe that itsinstitutions and entities must be adapted and reformedif it is to achieve its objectives.The interrelationship between development security and human rights within a framework ofdemocratic values is an expression of today’sinterdependent world  and of multilateralism  whichreaffirms the leading role of the United Nations andour ongoing determination to promote social progressand to improve living standards within a broaderconcept of freedom. In this context  Bolivia believesthat the recent commitment made at the world summitto adopt  in the near future  a United Nationsdeclaration on the rights of indigenous peoples willencourage social integration and peaceful nationalcoexistence.6Bolivia is sincere in its determination to achievepeace  solidarity and the well-being of all  to protectthe rule of law and to secure justice and liberty.Ultimately  we are guided by democracy — a systemthat can be improved upon  and a way of life."
"24",970,"BRA",60,2005,"I should liketo extend my warmest congratulations to you  Sir Ambassador Jan Eliasson of Sweden  on yourassumption of the presidency of the General Assemblyat its sixtieth session. I should also like to expressfraternal greetings to Secretary-General Kofi Annan whose wisdom and commitment to multilateralismhave made an immense contribution to progress here atthe United Nations. Minister Jean Ping of Gabondeserves special recognition for the competent anddedicated manner in which he presided over theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.This is a rare and historic opportunity to promotechange; let us not waste it. Peace  development democracy and respect for human rights are objectivesthat unite us. Reform must be our motto.The final document adopted yesterday at thesummit (resolution 60/1) has unquestionably fallenshort of our expectations. However  it provides us withguidelines that will enable us to carry out our work.The General Assembly must be strengthened.More than ever  we need a forum with universalrepresentation  in which the crucial issues of today’sworld can be democratically debated. The GeneralAssembly must provide leadership and politicalguidance to the Organization as a whole. In supportingthe authority of the General Assembly by enabling it toact more speedily and be more productive  we aresupporting the very essence of the United Nations.The Economic and Social Council must againbecome a dynamic and influential organ. It must helpus to come together on issues related to trade  financeand development in an environment free fromprejudice and dogma. The Economic and SocialCouncil should be a privileged  deliberative forum inour quest for reconciliation between the objectives ofsustainable economic growth and the reduction of theinequalities caused by asymmetric globalization.President Lula suggested this year  at the summit of theGroup of Eight (G-8) at Gleneagles  that we could startraising the profile of the Economic and Social Councilby organizing a high-level segment  with theparticipation of the Finance Minister of the countryholding the G-8 presidency. The Economic and SocialCouncil must also help to promote peace and stabilityin partnership with the Security Council  as providedfor in Article 65 of the Charter.The establishment of a PeacebuildingCommission will bridge an important institutional gap.It will be a link between security and development.Currently  there is no such link.The structures and mechanisms of theOrganization in the human rights field must beimproved and reinforced. We support the creation of aHuman Rights Council  based on the principles ofuniversality  dialogue and non-selectivity. Theelaboration of an annual global report on human rightsby the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights  covering allcountries and situations  will help to increase thecredibility of the United Nations human rights system.The Secretary-General has called for bettercoordination in our work to protect victims of graveand systematic violations of human rights.International cooperation in the field of human rightsand humanitarian assistance must be guided by theprinciple of collective responsibility. We havemaintained on several occasions — in our region andelsewhere — that the principle of non-intervention inthe domestic affairs of States must be associated withthe idea of “non-indifference”.We have been called upon to deal with newconcepts  such as human security and the responsibilityto protect. We agree that they merit a proper place inour system. But it is an illusion to believe that we cancombat the dysfunctional politics at the root of gravehuman rights violations by military means alone  oreven by economic sanctions  without fully utilizingdiplomacy and persuasion.Human security is mainly the result of just andequitable societies that promote and protect humanrights  strengthen democracy and respect the rule oflaw  while creating opportunities for economicdevelopment and social justice. The United Nations6was not created to disseminate the notion that ordershould be imposed by force. That extreme expedientcan be considered only when all other efforts havebeen exhausted and peaceful solutions have proved notto be viable. A judgement as to the existence of suchexceptional circumstances must always be amultilateral one.The Charter foresees two situations in which theuse of force is permissible: to restore or maintaininternational peace and security  and in the case of theright to self-defence. Mixing those two concepts wouldblur the meaning of the very tenets of thisOrganization.Security Council reform is the centrepiece of thereform process in which we are engaged. The vastmajority of Member States recognize the need to makethe Security Council more representative anddemocratic.At this historic juncture  no Security Councilreform effort will be meaningful unless it contemplatesan increase in the number of permanent and non-permanent seats  with developing countries fromAfrica  Latin America and Asia included in bothcategories. We cannot accept the perpetuation ofimbalances that run contrary to the very spirit ofmultilateralism.Above all  a more efficient Council must becapable of ensuring that its decisions are implemented.It is not reasonable to expect the Council to continue toexpand its agenda and responsibilities withoutaddressing its democracy deficit.Two years ago  President Luiz Inácio Lula daSilva declared before the Assembly that every nationthat is committed to democracy at the domestic levelmust strive for more transparent  legitimate andrepresentative decision-making processes in itsexternal relations. In the same spirit  Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan pointed out the contradictions to beovercome  stating:“We are the ones who go around the worldlecturing everybody about democracy. I think it isabout time we apply it to ourselves  and thenshow that there is effective representation”.We are still far from accomplishing the goals ofthe Millennium Declaration. This week’s summit hasstressed the importance of a renewed commitment todevelopment assistance and contributed to promotinguniversal acceptance of the target of 0.7 per cent ofgross national product devoted to official developmentassistance. At the same time  we must continue to workon innovative and additional sources of financing. Inote with satisfaction that since the Summit of WorldLeaders for Action against Hunger and Poverty convened last year by President Lula  we haveachieved significant progress. A growing number ofGovernments and non-governmental organizationshave joined in the effort to eradicate hunger andpoverty. This is the only war in which we are engaged.This is the only war we can all win.This year we witnessed yet again brutal acts ofterrorism. Innocent civilians  women and children aretoday victims of groups who stand as adversaries to thevalues we share. As a country whose identity cannot bedissociated from the notions of tolerance and diversity Brazil rejects in the strongest terms those abhorrentacts  which go against the very notion of humanity. Wewill continue to lend our support to increasedinternational cooperation in the fight against terrorismand in the struggle to eliminate its deep-rooted causes.Such efforts must be undertaken with due respectfor international law and human rights. The fightagainst terrorism cannot be viewed in terms of policerepression alone. Nor can such repression result inabsurd and indiscriminate killing like terrorism itself.Despite the fact that there is no automatic linkagebetween poverty and terrorism  communities can beexposed to extreme attitudes by fanatical groups as aresult of grave social and economic problems especially when associated with the absence of civiland political liberties. I wish to express Brazil’sreadiness to work intensively with a view to the promptconclusion of a comprehensive convention againstterrorism.We recognize the risks of the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. At the same time  wecannot disregard the importance of reducing anddismantling existing arsenals of all such weapons. Weregret that the seventh Review Conference of theParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons did not produce tangible results.Together with non-proliferation efforts  we mustcontinue to work tirelessly towards nucleardisarmament.In addition to the challenges I have just referredto  we are faced with two crises of global scope: the7pandemic explosion of HIV/AIDS and the seriousthreats posed by climate change. Brazil will continue topromote the implementation of existing multilateralinstruments to fight those scourges.Brazil is committed to reinforcing the strategicalliance with its main partner in our region —Argentina — and to the promotion of a prosperous integrated and politically stable South America building upon our experience in the Southern ConeCommon Market (MERCOSUR). We will tirelesslystrive for MERCOSUR’s advancement in the economicand political fields. The South American Communityof Nations  which was founded last year in Cuzco Peru  can be seen as a driving force for integration inLatin America and the Caribbean as a whole.Our efforts in establishing partnerships with otherdeveloping countries go beyond our immediate region.The India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum (IBSA)has brought together three large democracies fromAfrica  Asia and Latin America that are keen ondeepening the economic  political and cultural tiesbetween them and between their regions. Together withother partners  we have joined in setting up the Groupof Twenty (G-20)  which places developing countriesat the centre of agricultural trade negotiations of theWorld Trade Organization’s Doha round. Thanks to therole played by the G-20  it has been possible tocombine trade liberalization with social justice in thecontext of the multilateral trading system.Strengthening our ties with Africa has been along-standing aspiration of Brazil’s. No previousGovernment has pursued that objective with theresolve demonstrated by President Lula. Trade andcooperation between Brazil and Africa have grownsignificantly. Political dialogue has intensified. Wehave been contributing to the consolidation of peaceand democracy in countries such as Guinea-Bissau andSao Tome and Principe. We have helped to fighthunger  develop agriculture and combat the scourge ofHIV/AIDS in various brother countries of Africa.The same sense of solidarity inspires us toparticipate in United Nations peace efforts in Haiti.The Brazilian and Latin American presence in Haiti isunprecedented  in terms of both troops and politicalcommitment. We are motivated by three mainobjectives: establishing a safe environment  promotingdialogue among the various political actors with a viewto a genuine democratic transition and securingeffective international support for institutional  socialand economic reconstruction. Haiti is likely to be thefirst test case for the Peacebuilding Commission.Brazil and the Arab world are renewing their tiesof friendship  inspired by strong historical and culturalaffinities. Apart from bilateral initiatives  Brazil hasbeen strengthening its relations with regionalgroupings such as the Gulf Cooperation Council andthe Arab League. In May 2005  an unprecedentedsummit of South American and Arab States took placein Brasilia. That pioneering initiative brought togethertwo regions of the developing world in a concretedemonstration of harmony of civilizations.On several trips to the Middle East  I had theopportunity to talk to variety of people  includingleaders from Israel and Palestine. They are aware ofBrazil’s willingness to support the work of the Quartetas a partner for peace. The practice of tolerance andrespect for others  as well as the harmonious co-existence of different communities in our country constitute our comparative advantage. I believe thatconviction is shared by eminent persons and politicalleaders from both Israel and Palestine.At the beginning of this new chapter in the life ofthe United Nations  Brazil remains committed to theideals that led to the creation of the only Organizationof universal scope  the only body that can guarantee afuture of peace and prosperity — not for the few  butfor all."
"25",1014,"BRB",60,2005,"I join with otherdelegations in congratulating you  Mr. President  onyour election to preside over the sixtieth session of theUnited Nations General Assembly. The Barbadosdelegation’s appreciation is also extended to theoutgoing President  His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping Foreign Minister of Gabon  for the outstanding workhe has done in guiding the Assembly during theprevious session and particularly in the preparationsfor the High-level Plenary Meeting.Last week  heads of State and Government  in anattempt to define and articulate a global consensus adopted an outcome document representing thedetermination of the vast majority to make progresstowards full achievement of the goals and targetsinspired by the Millennium Declaration  as well as anumber of decisions on United Nations reform.Barbados  as part of the tremendous efforts made bymany  had hoped for bolder and more ambitiouscommitments  particularly regarding development.In all of the circumstances  we accept that theoutcome of the High-level Plenary Meeting providesthe platform for coordinated international action inresponse to the complex and interconnected globalchallenges confronting this and future generations.The Millennium Development Goals are nowrecognized as the world’s time-bound  quantifiabletargets for addressing poverty in its many dimensionsof hunger  disease  lack of access to health care andeducation  gender inequality and environmentaldegradation. Progress on their achievement has beenfar from uniform across the world  or for that matteracross the Goals. Unless action is taken on a muchbroader front and a much faster pace  the eminentlylaudable words of the Declaration will serve only asgrim reminders of human needs neglected and ofnumerous promises unfulfilled.The Secretary-General has stated that ourgeneration  with the combination of resources andtechnology at its disposal  must be the first to make theright of development a reality for everyone and to freethe entire human race from war.Progress towards the achievement of theMillennium Development Goals in Barbados isencouraging. Although the regional report of theUnited Nations Development Programme presents anoptimistic outlook for most Caribbean countries inrespect of the first five Goals  the region faces severechallenges and constraints to their achievement.Foremost among them  and beyond our control  is ourvulnerability to economic shocks and to every naturaldisaster known to mankind — be it hurricane  volcaniceruption  mudslide  earthquake or flood.Equally challenging is the fuller and moreeffective integration of Barbados in the globalizedeconomy  for which a successful outcome of the nextDoha development round of talks on tradeliberalization is crucial.Permit me to refer to an outstanding omissionfrom the Millennium Development Goals  that ofsexual and reproductive health and rights. Indeed  theexclusion was so stark that the Secretary-Generalhimself stated:“The Millennium Development Goals particularly the eradication of extreme poverty8and hunger  cannot be achieved if questions ofpopulation and reproductive health are notsquarely addressed. And that means strongerefforts to promote women’s rights and greaterinvestment in education and health  includingreproductive health and family planning.”We must seize the opportunity presented by thiscurrent review of the implementation of theMillennium Development Goals to mainstream sexualand reproductive health and rights by adopting auniversal access target or indicator that can be used tofacilitate the monitoring of progress in this area and tohold Governments accountable.Barbados takes the position that women arecentral to the successful implementation of theMillennium Development Goals. After all  women ofchildbearing age constitute one billion of the world’spoorest people  and for this group sexual andreproductive health issues are at the fore of problemsof ill health and loss of productivity. Women living inpoverty are not usually aware of their sexual andreproductive rights and are often ignorant about theservices to which they have a right of access. Similarly poor women  and in particular poor young women  arehighly susceptible to contracting HIV/AIDS despite theprevalence of preventive measures.I feel compelled to support the call for mobilizingnew resources for improved sexual and reproductivehealth services for women and for men worldwide.Individuals  non-governmental organizations andGovernments in developing countries are alreadycontributing more than 75 per cent to currentexpenditures in this field. It is certainly time fordeveloped countries to live up to the pledges they madeat the 1994 International Conference on Population andDevelopment.Central to the global partnership for development which is embodied in the eighth MillenniumDevelopment Goal  are the commitments bydeveloping countries to pursue sound macroeconomicpolicies  to make the most creative use of our limitedendowments  to respect human rights and to ensure thatour material development takes place within thecontext of social justice  commitments that Barbadoshas proudly upheld since becoming independent in1966.By the same token  developed countries mustfulfil their obligations made at numerous UnitedNations summits and conferences on trade  debt andfinance  and in particular their pledge to honour theoutstanding target of 0.7 per cent of gross domesticproduct for official development assistance (ODA).Increases in ODA will not be sufficient to achieve thesustained economic growth and development that weall seek. It will also be necessary for the internationalcommunity to address the indebtedness of poor andmiddle-income developing countries; promote foreigndirect investment flows to a broader range ofdeveloping countries; confront serious globalenvironmental problems such as climate change;combat HIV/AIDS; and reform multilateral tradingarrangements as well as systemic deficiencies in theglobal economic and financial system. These are thereal threats to our human security as we see it in theCaribbean.The Doha development round  launched by theWorld Trade Organization in 2001  is so calledprecisely because trade ministers deliberately sought toplace development at the centre of multilateral tradenegotiations. This decision inspired new hope indeveloping countries that we would be afforded theopportunity to participate more effectively andbeneficially in the new global economic system.Regrettably  some of our developed countrycounterparts seem to have reneged on theircommitment. We are still locked in a fierce struggle atthe World Trade Organization to persuade thesecountries to rise above their narrow self-interests andembrace positions that would allow for the creation ofa more just global economic order.Barbados fears that we could squander yetanother opportunity genuinely to involve developingcountries in the multilateral trading system. We do notbelieve that the international community can continueto ignore this fact. Furthermore  we are far fromconvinced that the High-level Plenary Meeting of lastweek fully refocused global attention on matters ofdevelopment and rescued from obscurity the globaldevelopment agenda  which has unfortunately beenovertaken by a narrowly defined anti-terrorism agenda.“It is time to put the global development agenda including that for the world’s smallest and mostvulnerable countries and societies  back on track”.Those are the words of the Prime Minister of Barbados The Right Honourable Owen Arthur.9Barbados considers that peace and collectivesecurity  human rights and the rule of law represent  inaddition to development  a strong foundation on whichthe United Nations can assist the internationalcommunity in building a stronger world. Issues ofterrorism  responsibility to protect  disarmament andnon-proliferation need also to be addressed.Terrorism affects all countries  both large andsmall  and all countries have an obligation to theinternational community to ensure that the perpetratorsof acts of terrorism do not find safe haven and succourwithin their borders. While we believe that the UnitedNations should strongly and unequivocally issue acondemnation of terrorism in all of its forms  care mustbe taken to formulate an unambiguous definition thatwould provide a basis for a comprehensive convention.This would rightly place the United Nations at the veryheart of the fight against terrorism  signalling amultilateral approach to this scourge.Closely linked to the issue of terrorism is that ofdisarmament and non-proliferation. Action taken bythe United Nations must be clear and firm  and effortsmust be redoubled to find compromises that wouldfacilitate progress. The Caribbean remains a majorroute for international narco-traffickers and suffersfrom the destabilizing effects of the parallel illegaltrade in small arms  promoted by the sametransnational criminal elements. The absence ofconcerted international action against small armstrafficking places the peace-loving societies of thesmall Caribbean States at great risk. Small armsproliferation and the violence that accompanies itimpact negatively on our development  our securityand human rights  and pose a severe threat to thepeaceful  stable and sustainable development ofCaribbean democracies.Barbados supports the call for the negotiation of anew international instrument on the marking andtracing of weapons. This is an urgent priority whichwill provide the international community with aneffective means of monitoring the movement andproliferation of small arms and taking comprehensiveinterdiction and enforcement action against illegaltraders.Barbados remains resolute in its rejection of thecontinued use of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of nuclear and radioactive waste. This high-risk practice poses grave danger to our region in theevent that there is an accident  a natural disaster or aterrorist attack.The Secretary-General has emphasized that if theUnited Nations is to be a useful instrument for itsmembers and is to successfully address the challengesfacing humanity  then it must be fully adapted to theneeds and circumstances not only of today  buttomorrow as well. Barbados shares this view. Reformshould not be seen as an end in and of itself  but as ameans towards achieving the goals we have setourselves in 2000 in the Millennium Declaration  tomake the United Nations a more effective instrumentfor pursuing the priorities of the world’s peoples.Reform should also seek to enhance the role of theUnited Nations in global affairs to create the conditionsfor more democratic and transparent decision-makingand to provide a forum for the full and equalparticipation of small States.Barbados believes that the main organs of theUnited Nations should be strengthened. This willrequire the revitalization of the General Assembly tomake it the chief deliberative and policy-making bodyof the Organization  as envisaged by the UnitedNations Charter. It will further require the reform ofthe Security Council to make it more representative ofcurrent global geopolitical realities. Small Statesshould be represented continuously in the membershipof the Council  and any arrangements for the selectionof the non-permanent members of a reformed Councilshould be so formulated.We are convinced that the Economic and SocialCouncil should play a larger role in policy-making oninternational economic and social matters and thepromotion of improved global economic governance. Arestructured Economic and Social Council should findits voice again as a vibrant forum for economic policydialogue  for promoting increased guidance andcoordination to the United Nations funds  programmesand agencies and for monitoring the implementationand follow-up of the Millennium Development Goalsand other major elements of the global developmentorder.If the United Nations is to undertake fully andeffectively the demanding responsibilities with whichit has been charged  then it must be provided with therequired level of resources  and the Secretary-Generalmust be given appropriate managerial authority. TheBarbados delegation intends to participate actively in10the delineation of these issues during this sixtiethsession.As a small State  Barbados believes that a strongmultilateral system  with the United Nations at its core is our greatest protection from the unilateral pursuits ofthe powerful. We are unwavering in our commitment tothe precepts of multilateralism and to the belief that noother international institution is better suited orequipped to meet the diverse demands for global peace security and development than this Organization. As amember of the United Nations  Barbados must beassured that its voice will continue to be heardregardless of size or economic power. This is a strugglefrom which we are not at liberty to abstain."
"26",1046,"BRN",60,2005,"I would like to offer my congratulationsto the President on his election. In doing so  I assure allour fellow members of Brunei Darussalam's continuedstrong support for the United Nations.Much of the attention at almost every greatinternational meeting for the past four years has beengiven to the inhuman acts of global terrorists.Inevitably  this has focused on specific events. That isunderstandable  of course  and we in BruneiDarussalam again add our voices to the condemnationof all such actions. We offer our deepest condolencesto the families of all who have suffered losses.Nevertheless  as we meet our respected fellowMembers of the United Nations  we again state whatwe have continuously said since the onset of thecurrent wave of global terrorism. These brutal attacksextend beyond personal grief and national13condemnation. They are symptomatic of many gravethreats the people of the world face today. As such they constitute nothing less than an attack on worldorder.For this reason  we believe it is high time theworld order asserted itself in modern terms. In otherwords  a new  revitalized United Nations is calledfor ó not for us as Heads of State  or for ourdiplomats  or for any of us who are privileged and havethe means  the education and the opportunity to live inhope and confidence. A new United Nations is neededby the ordinary citizens we are privileged to represent here.If world order is indeed under attack  that meansordinary people and their families are also underattack. In far too many ways  it is not merely an attack.It is an all-out assault. It comes not merely fromcriminal terrorists: it comes from many aspects ofglobalization  from international crime  from newtechnology  from social and cultural disruption  from arapidly degrading environment and from the gravethreats posed by the possible spread of fearful newdiseases. In real  immediate human terms  it comesfrom fear  from injustice  from a loss of absolute valuesand from sheer rage. It is revealed in feelings ofhopelessness and an almost total loss of confidence.Many of us here  especially those from smalldeveloping nations  are  therefore  convinced thatworld order must be dramatically strengthened. As Istated at the High-level Plenary Meeting two days ago(see A/60/PV.6)  there is no greater way to begin thisprocess than for each of us to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). For this reason  we inBrunei Darussalam will do whatever we can to achievethem in our own country and to help our neighbours dolikewise.In setting the Millennium Goals  we recognizedthat  in order to re-establish world order  the rootcauses of anger  despair  injustice and hatred must beaddressed. I would  therefore  once more like tocommend the Secretary-General and his staff and theUnited Nations agencies  both professional andvolunteer  for all they have done in the field to deepenour understanding of those causes. The causes havebecome clearly defined in all their urgency. They arepolitical  social  cultural and economic. In each case we do not believe that solutions can be imposed. Whenthe international community is so gravely divided onmatters such as nuclear development  armsproliferation  globalization  the environment and socialinjustice  this body must be the judge of whetherinternational conduct is acceptable. Solutions tointernational problems must come from truly unitednations acting in concert. In other words  the UnitedNations must be an efficient world organizationcommitted to tackling root causes and insisting ondialogue and negotiation as the sole means of settlingdisputes  no matter how long it takes and no matterhow frustrating the process may be.The global crisis arising from the search for thebest way to deal with modern  technology-fuelledterrorism highlights that need. For many years  wehave maintained that understanding root causes mustbe a very important part of any long-term approach totackling terrorist activities.Of course  every possible form of bilateral andmultilateral cooperation is needed to deal with thecriminals involved. But condemnation is not enough and legislation is never sufficient. All attempts tojustify acts of terrorism must be resolutely countered not by exchanges of opposing definitions of evil but bydetermination to eradicate all possible root causes which some may wrongly see as justifying such acts.That is very difficult. It requires consensus hereat the United Nations on what constitutes injustice especially historical injustice  and on what constitutesunfairness. That  in turn  demands a new  reformedUnited Nations.We are a small nation. Our interest lies inworking closely with all other Members. For thatreason  we shall offer whatever help we can to buildingthe broadest possible consensus on all the many far-reaching decisions that the Organization is currentlycalled upon to make.The most important of those decisions at presentconcerns the question of United Nations reform. Likemany of our fellow Members  we have long given ourstrong support to reform. In recent months  we haveheld discussions with many colleagues that go farbeyond matters of principle; they have dealt withspecific proposals. Most of them aim at redesigning thestructure of the Organization  including the SecurityCouncil. Our response has been the one we havealways offered. We will listen with respect. We willacknowledge the good faith of all our fellow Members and we will help in any way we can to achieve thebroadest possible consensus. That  we think  is not a14way of avoiding the hard decisions that have to bemade. On the contrary  we believe it serves torecognize how hard those decisions are and howimportant this body is to the world.The consensus that was reached 60 years ago wasa strong one. It served the world well for manydecades. It now appears very clear that  although thestructure of the United Nations remains in place  theworld has changed enormously. A new consensus isbeing sought. Unlike the consensus reached at the endof the Second World War  it is not directed at themeans to maintain peace; it is aimed at creating theconditions for lasting peace. We see that as the onlyway for the United Nations to block all forces ofviolence and inhumanity by means of a strong and justworld order.When it is time for the Assembly to decide  we inBrunei Darussalam will consider all proposals in that light."
"27",1087,"BTN",60,2005,"Allow me to begin byextending my delegation’s warmest congratulations tothe President upon his assumption of the office of thepresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtiethsession. We have full confidence in his ability to guideour deliberations to a successful conclusion. I also paytribute to his predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  for skilfullyconducting the work of the fifty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly and for his efforts in preparing theHigh-level Plenary Meeting  held from 14 to16 September 2005.It is appropriate that the theme for the sixtiethsession of the General Assembly is “For a stronger andmore effective United Nations: the follow-up andimplementation of the High-level Plenary Meeting inSeptember 2005”.Indeed  this session has the responsibility toimplement the decisions of the High-level PlenaryMeeting. Our leaders have clearly pronounced that thegoals and objectives of the Millennium Summit andother United Nations conferences and summitsrepresent the minimum required to deal with the issuesand challenges of our time. Their message is that 2005should be a year for concrete action to deliver on thosegoals and objectives. We must  therefore  summonpolitical will and assume moral responsibility to worktruly for the benefit of our peoples on whose behalf wegather at the United Nations year after year.In the report “In larger freedom: towardsdevelopment  security and human rights for all”(A/59/2005)  the Secretary-General argues that theprinciples and purposes of the United Nationscontained in the Charter remain as valid and relevanttoday as they were in 1945 and that what is nowrequired is for practice and organization to move withthe times. My delegation fully agrees with that view.Our work must always be guided by the Charter  butour approach must adapt to changing circumstancesand challenges. In doing so  we must move beyondnarrow national perspectives and interests and treat allissues in a balanced and holistic manner.As I stated at the High-level Plenary Meeting lastweek  my delegation supports all initiatives tostrengthen the United Nations and its institutions. Of17significant interest to my delegation is thestrengthening of this Assembly  which is the onlyuniversal body in the United Nations. There is a clearconsensus within the membership on the need forurgent and wide-ranging reform of the United Nations although differences remain on the nature and extent ofreform. The 2005 World Summit Outcome hasentrusted the sixtieth session with implementation ofcertain reform decisions and at the same time withcarrying out further discussions and negotiations inareas where consensus has not been reached. We mustcontinue with our efforts to find consensus in thoseareas.Among the issues that are unresolved is thereform of the Security Council. We have debated thisissue for well over a decade  but have not yet reached adecision. My country continues to call for early actionto enlarge the permanent and non-permanentmembership of the Security Council and to improve itsworking methods. In this context  we reiterate oursupport to include Brazil  Germany  India and Japan aspermanent members. Those countries havedemonstrated their capacity and will to contribute toworld peace and security. We also believe that Africashould be adequately represented by permanentmembership on the Council.Development is the most immediate and pressingissue for the vast majority of Member States. No otherissue can be as central as development when millionslive in deprivation and despair; and global peace andsecurity cannot be truly achieved without advancingdevelopment. In fact  partnership in other areas cannotbe sustained without genuine international cooperationin development.The shortfalls in our commitments to theMillennium Summit and other major United Nationsconferences and summits are all too clear. More needsto be done urgently to address the hurdles ofdevelopment  which range from finance to debt  trade global governance and systemic issues  theenvironment and science and technology.Adequate and predictable sources of financing arecrucial for the success of development efforts. Wetherefore welcome ideas for innovative sources offunding and calls for increased official developmentassistance (ODA). In this regard  my delegation wouldlike to commend those countries that have achieved orexceeded the ODA target of 0.7 per cent of grossnational product (GNP). We welcome the timetableestablished by some countries to achieve the ODAtarget by 2015 and urge others to do so expeditiously.We also urge that 0.2 per cent of GNP be allocated toleast developed countries to enable them to achieve thegoals and objectives of the Brussels Programme ofAction and the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs). The recent decision of the Group of 8 (G-8)to cancel the external debt of 18 highly indebted poorcountries  including 13 least developed countries  is awelcome move. My delegation is hopeful that the sameconsideration will be given to all least developedcountries.As a small  least developed and landlockedcountry  Bhutan sees official development assistance asits primary source of financing for development. In thisregard  my delegation would like to place on record itsdeep appreciation of the bilateral and multilateralpartners that are actively supporting our developmentefforts. Despite a significant increase in its ownresources  my country will have to rely on ODA forsome time in its efforts to realize the MDGs as well asfor overall development.The continued support of the internationalcommunity for our development efforts is crucial at thepresent juncture. Decades of gradual but deliberatechange in the system of governance of the country spearheaded by His Majesty King Jigme SingyeWangchuck  are entering a critical phase. A draftconstitution for the country is currently underdiscussion. Its adoption in the near future willtransform the country into a parliamentary democracy.For this system of governance to succeed  it isimperative that the country be able to maintain thecurrent level of progress in the social  economic andother fields.My country attaches great importance to theconservation and protection of the environment  ashuman life is fundamentally dependent on naturalsystems and resources. There cannot be sustainabledevelopment without environmental sustainability. Wemust commit ourselves to meeting the goals of  interalia  the World Summit on Sustainable Development Agenda 21 and the Kyoto Protocol. In Bhutan  we havemade serious efforts to integrate the principles andpractices of environmental sustainability into ourdevelopment policies and programmes. As a result ofour conservation efforts  Bhutan has successfullymaintained 72.5 per cent of its land area under forest18cover. Our modest achievement in this area was dulyrecognized by the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme (UNEP) in April 2005 when it awarded toHis Majesty the King and the people of Bhutan aUNEP Champions of the Earth 2005 award.My country fully supports the establishment of aworldwide early warning system for all naturalhazards. Situated in a very fragile mountain ecosystem Bhutan is prone to glacial floods and other naturaldisasters  including earthquakes. The solidarity that theinternational community demonstrated last year whenmany countries in the Indian Ocean rim weredevastated by the tsunami was exemplary and is worthreplicating in other areas.Terrorism is a pernicious threat to peace andsecurity. It cannot be justified under anycircumstances. It is imperative for the internationalcommunity to act resolutely to root out this menace.We condemn terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations. Bhutan supports all efforts to concludea comprehensive convention on international terrorismand other initiatives. Small and poor developingcountries are particularly vulnerable and are in need ofinternational support to fight terrorism. They are alsovulnerable to transnational crime and need assistanceto deal with it.International migration is on the increase today.Migration offers opportunities and at the same timepresents serious challenges to both source and recipientcountries. Associated with it is the problem of illegalimmigration  which presents serious challenges particularly to small countries such as my own. It istherefore important for a high-level dialogue oninternational migration and development to be held bythe General Assembly in 2006 to address all issuesassociated with migration.My delegation supports the Secretary-General’scontinuing efforts to organize annual multilateral treatyevents in conjunction with General Assembly sessions.In this context  we are pleased to report to theAssembly that Bhutan acceded to the following treatieslast week: the United Nations Convention againstCorruption; the Optional Protocol to the Convention onthe Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Childrenin Armed Conflict; and the Optional Protocol to theConvention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale ofChildren  Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.Bhutan  as a responsible Member State  fullyupholds all relevant international treaties andconventions. However  our desire to accede to them isconsistently constrained by lack of capacity to dealwith the range of issues they contain and by thedifficulties of meeting reporting and other obligations.This is a serious hurdle faced by many small countries especially least developed countries. There is a genuineneed to look at ways to simplify reporting and otherobligations and to provide technical and financialassistance to countries in need.We must heed the call of the Secretary-Generalwho has said “Our action must be as urgent as the need and on the same scale. ... Only by actingdecisively now can we both confront the pressingsecurity challenges and win a decisive victory inthe global battle against poverty by 2015”.(A/59/2005  para. 23)We believe that the time to act is now. We must not letthe opportunity slip. I wish the General Assemblycontinued success at this session."
"28",1171,"CAF",60,2005,"I should like first of all to express13heartfelt congratulations to you  Sir  on behalf of mydelegation and on my own behalf  on your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixtiethsession. We wish you every success in the discharge ofyour important functions. Your election to thepresidency is  of course a reflection of your greatpersonal qualities and experience. But it is also atribute to your country  Sweden  which has alwaysbeen committed to United Nations activities  inparticular development assistance.I would like to take this opportunity to express toyour predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  Minister for ForeignAffairs of Gabon  my deep admiration for hisoutstanding work as President  including theconsiderable efforts that he made throughout his termof office with a view to ensuring the success of theHigh-level Plenary Meeting  which took place from14 to 16 September. As an African and as arepresentative of a country member of the EconomicCommunity of Central African States  I cannot but feelgreat pride in his achievements.Just a few days ago  a major event took placehere at the United Nations — an event comparable tothe Millennium Summit  in which leaders from all overthe world took part.I am sure that we all remember how the Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth sessioninvited us to focus our discussion on the theme  “Astronger and more effective Organization: follow-up toand implementation of the High-level Plenary Meetingin September 2005”.On Friday  16 September  late in the evening  acompromise document was adopted  which wasacceptable to my delegation  even though it did notrespond to all the concerns expressed in the courageousreport of the Secretary-General  to whom  once again my country would like to pay a well-deserved tribute.Some of the bold proposals that he made  in particularthose relating to the need to reform the Organization seem to us still to be entirely relevant  since theywould make the United Nations stronger and moreeffective by adapting it to the challenges of twenty-firstcentury.The delegation of the Central African Republicbelieves that the debate on the reform of theOrganization  in particular the reform of the SecurityCouncil  is far from over. This is not simply a matter ofjustice for all those who were not present in SanFrancisco 60 years ago when the Organization wascreated. The African continent  which really began tomake itself heard internationally from 1960 onwards rightly claims its place within the Security Council onan equitable basis. We can rest assured that the youngpeople of Africa are paying attention to the activities ofthe United Nations and to our discussions here  andthey find it increasingly difficult to understand why ourcontinent is the only one not to have a permanent seatin that body  which is responsible for taking the mostimportant decisions affecting peace and securitythroughout the world  including in Africa.In a statement made from this rostrum onThursday  15 September 2005  during the debate in theHigh-level Plenary Meeting  His ExcellencyMr. François Bozizé  President of the Central AfricanRepublic  underlined the extent to which we  the smalldeveloping countries  in particular those that have gonethrough or that are currently going through majorconflicts or political crises  need a strong and effectiveUnited Nations.The recent history of our country makes clear theextent to which international solidarity  coordinated bythe United Nations and its specialized agencies succeeded in helping us to get back on our feet. Afteralmost a decade of chaos  on 15 March 2003 anupsurge of patriotism enabled us to make a consensus-based transition  and we have benefited from thesupport  advice and expertise  as well as the financialand material assistance  of all of our external partners.For two years  we were assisted by the UnitedNations Peacebuilding Support Office in the CentralAfrican Republic  the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme and other specialized agencies  and by ourbilateral and multilateral partners  including France China  the United States of America  the EuropeanUnion  the International Organization of laFrancophonie and  of course  our high-ranking Africancolleagues  among them the countries of the CentralAfrican Economic and Monetary Community  underthe chairmanship of El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba President of Gabon.Therefore  the success of our consensus-basedtransition is to a large extent the success ofinternational solidarity as mobilized by the UnitedNations. Of course  the national will  expressed firstand foremost by the citizens of the Central AfricanRepublic at all levels — who are weary of violence and14chaos and yearn for peace — and supported by ourpolitical elite as reflected in governmental actions byPresident Bozizé himself  this national will has beenthe prime factor enabling us to bring our transitionalperiod and electoral process to a successful conclusion.In this sense  and rightly so  the internationalcommunity has paid unanimous tribute to the wisdomof the Central Africans  who have chosen to return topeace and national concord.But international solidarity was a necessarycondition that led us successfully to a consensus-basedtransition and a successful electoral process. That iswhy  on behalf of President François Bozizé and theCentral African Government and people  I should liketo reiterate to all of our partners an expression of ourgratitude.As the head of State said in his statement onThursday  15 September 2005  the Central AfricanRepublic is starting on a second stage in its process ofreturn to peace and security  and that is the stage ofreconstruction. This is a tremendous challenge in acountry that was ruined and subject to chaos for manyyears. As Central Africans  we are well aware of ourprime responsibility  of our collective responsibility asa nation  for the disaster that our country lived through.If only for that reason  the bulk of the efforts andsacrifices to be made in the reconstruction must fall tous. We are fully convinced of that. But we musthonestly admit that in the face of the enormity andcomplexity of the tasks involved in reconstruction  theneed for solidarity is still great. In saying that  we wishsimply to recall precedents where the internationalcommunity understood that the best way to avoid astep backwards was to support reconstruction in astrong way. The real victory over violence and disorderis achieved when extreme poverty  which is the primecause of the frustrations that lead to confrontation  isrolled back. Successful elections and democraticinstitutions that begin to function and cope with thecountry’s problems are certainly an important advancealong the lengthy and difficult path toward peace andstability. But all this remains basically precarious  aslong as the legitimate expectations of the populationare not satisfied and their hope to benefit from thedividends of peace is not realized. How can this bedone in a country that has been bled white  that doesnot even have the minimum required for life  and onwhich donors impose the same conditions as they do oncountries that are functioning normally? How  when acountry is painfully emerging from a long period ofchaos  can it find the resources to repay the debt so thatit can hope to benefit from additional economicassistance?These issues and others face the internationalcommunity as part of its responsibility for managingthe emergence from crisis. This raises the question ofthe ways and means of consolidating peace to emergefrom a period of chaos in order to avoid the risk of areturn to square one. The Secretary-General veryrightly underlined this in his report. The outcomedocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting alsomentions that. The creation of a Peace-buildingCommission is  therefore  very timely. This is a signthat there is uncertainty in conflict management  as todischarge a sick person when convalescence is onlyjust beginning often leads to a relapse. It would be agood thing if this uncertainty could be removed. Themoving appeal made by the President of theTransitional Government of Somalia strengthens us inour belief that the best way to avoid relapses  whichare very difficult and costly to manage  is to providestrong support for reconstruction.Whenever a country that has plunged into theabyss starts to raise its head again  it is a victory for thewhole of humanity  and humanity cannot stand bywhile one of its members drowns  however small it is.Emergence from a crisis stands  therefore  as a newchallenge for the United Nations. It is a matter ofcreating the conditions under which a country that isstarting on the return to peace and stability can avoidtumbling back into a state of chaos. The solutioninvolves  in our opinion  an additional demonstrationof solidarity and generosity from its developmentpartners to support the efforts of the convalescingsociety.Our country is convinced that a lasting return topeace involves the participation of people at all levelsof Central African society. The quest for peace andstability is not only the concern of professionalpoliticians. Of course  it is important that politicianswork tirelessly to develop arrangements that are inkeeping with the national interest and that they avoidany radicalization of their political positions in order togive peace a chance. This is the behaviour CentralAfrican politicians have exhibited and it explains to alarge extent the peaceful outcome of the consensus-based transitional process and the successful electoralprocess.15But this is not enough to consolidate peace.Those who pay the highest price for the failures ofpolitics must also have their say. Young people women  peasants  urban employees  privateentrepreneurs and the media all have a great interest inbeing closely involved in efforts and actions aimed atpeacebuilding and we should therefore pay tribute tothe model of cooperation initiated by the UnitedNations in the Great Lakes region of Africa. Thiscooperation  which regularly brings together the headsof State and their ministers as well as various segmentsof civil society  ensures that discussions related to thequest for peace involve non-politicians as well. Thisinitiative  moreover  has the merit of bringing to thetable other countries  either closely or less closelyinvolved in the Great Lakes problems. In fact  no crisisis limited to just one country  there are direct orindirect effects on neighbours. That is why thetremendous work done by Professor Ibrahima Fallshould be encouraged and supported.As far as the Central African Republic isconcerned  the priorities of the Government ofNational Reconciliation formed after the election wereclearly identified in the Declaration of General Policypresented to the National Assembly in early August byPrime Minister Elie Dote. There are three focal pointsfor the short and medium term. First  the re-establishment of security throughout the wholecountry; secondly  the control and stabilization ofpublic finances; and thirdly  the rehabilitation andrelaunching of various sectors of the national economy such as the mining industries  lumber  agriculture andlivestock.With regard to the first point  it goes withoutsaying that no progress is possible without eradicatingthe endemic insecurity caused by armed bands especially those who set up roadblocks. Reconstructionof the security and defence forces  which has alreadybegun  and the re-equipment of those forces are mattersthat the Government is working to resolve. Subregionalcooperation is also an important asset  with the activepresence of the multinational force of the Economicand Monetary Community of Central Africa andoperations carried out by forces from the CentralAfrican Republic  Cameroon and Chad along theirshared borders. In this connection we should paytribute to the initiative taken by the United NationsPeacebuilding Support Office in Bangui  whichorganized a meeting of subregional diplomats anddefence experts in Yaoundé  from 26 to 27 August. Weshould also pay tribute to the contribution of France which is providing the multinational force of theEconomic and Monetary Community of Central Africawith valuable logistical support.Beyond short-term considerations  the majorlong-term challenges facing the Central AfricanRepublic are those of health and education. Educationand health care are among the principal objectives ofthe Millennium Development Goals. The CentralAfrican Republic hopes to achieve those Goals by2015. We know that lasting development cannot beestablished without strengthening our nationalcapacities.Having suffered in various ways in recent years the people of the Central African Republic sincerelyaspire to peace and stability. They are determined tostrive and sacrifice in order to leave the painful pastbehind. They need the understanding and support oftheir partners  chief among which is the UnitedNations."
"29",1218,"CAN",60,2005,"Thesixtieth anniversary of the United Nations is cause forinspiration  concern and action. It is a source ofinspiration because 60 years of collective action forpeace and development is an anniversary to celebrate.And what better time to do so than on the InternationalDay of Peace? It is a cause for concern because thechallenges  far from diminishing  have continued togrow  and we have not reached a consensus on a wholerange of essential reforms. Some importantcomponents are missing. It is a call for action becauseall of us here have recognized that the United Nationsremains an indispensable instrument and becausechange is still needed. We have no choice: we mustmove forward.But we have come a long way. Two years ago  theUnited Nations was in a sorry state indeed; thesituation in Iraq not only had divided the membershipbut had left deep scars within our institution. That iswhy I pay tribute to the Secretary-General for havingestablished the High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change  whose report (A/59/565) hastruly revolutionized how all of us think about theOrganization’s future.Jeffrey Sachs and his colleagues also delivered tous a remarkable document on “Investing inDevelopment” — development that Canada has doneso much to promote ever since the era of LesterPearson. In “In larger freedom” (A/59/2005)  theSecretary-General summarized that work with clarityand discernment and set out an ambitious plan for us.We have not adopted all of his recommendations — farfrom it. We could have  and should have  done better.The summit is by no means the end of the debate. Tothe contrary  we have a mandate to continue our effortsand to make this sixtieth-anniversary year a year ofreform.We are all aware of the risks of unilateralism orpiecemeal multilateralism. But we are not sufficientlyaware that humanity’s future lies in accepting theinextricable links among security  development andhuman rights.To predict the future is to understand the past  soit behoves us all to look back over the 60 years of ourOrganization. The contribution of the United Nationsto the progress of humanity is indisputable. TheOrganization’s successes  more than its failures  showus the path to take so that we can meet current andfuture challenges.Let us not forget that in 1945 the whole worldwas rising from ruins and States were determined thatthat would never happen again. So it is not surprisingthat the first objective expressed in the Charter of theUnited Nations centred on security so as to “savesucceeding generations from the scourge of war  whichtwice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow tomankind”.We have known the horrors of war over the past60 years  but we have avoided descending into the hellof a third world war. How did we do that? At theUnited Nations  the super-Powers had no choice. Underthe aegis of the Organization  they concluded majordisarmament and arms control agreements. In sum  therole played by the United Nations in ending the standoff between East and West is one of the greatestsuccesses of the past century.(spoke in English)Sixty years ago  the nations meeting in SanFrancisco set the second objective: to reaffirm faith infundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth ofthe human person  in the equal rights of men andwomen and of nations large and small. The founders ofthe United Nations foresaw that if we were to avoid theconflicts of the past  the world of tomorrow needed tobe more human. With that in mind  Canada’s JohnHumphrey worked hard to help draft the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights.14We have become ever more demanding about theprotection of human rights — including women’srights — as well we should be. We are duty-bound toprevent or combat flagrant violations  which stillplague the world. The Commission on Human Rightshas played a key role in that respect  but its seriousshortcomings unfortunately eclipse its valuablecontributions  necessitating its replacement.Mr. Mwakwere (Kenya)  Vice-President  took theChair.History shows that democracy and human rightsgo hand in hand. The United Nations has entrenchedhuman rights through a series of legal instruments thatGovernments concluded under the Organization’s aegisand has extended a range of protections  such asconventions on eliminating discrimination againstwomen  on children’s rights and against torture.The United Nations remains a key forum fordebating human rights failures around the world. Andit is in that area that the Organization has played aleading role in changing global culture  fostering theacceptance of new standards and setting criteria forjudging Governments’ actions. That is anotherremarkable success for the United Nations.The third objective of the Charter called onMembers to establish conditions under which justiceand respect for the obligations arising from treaties andother sources of international law can be maintained.For 60 years  the United Nations has been at the heartof a vast network of bilateral and regional treatiescovering nearly the gamut of international relations. Inso doing  the Organization has helped to bring about aninfinitely more integrated world where interactionsamong peoples take place in a predictable fashion andwithin a defined regulatory framework. This globallegal framework is the foundation of peace. Where theframework has not yet taken shape  conflicts multiply.The world needs the United Nations to perfect thistremendous asset.The fourth objective of the Charter touched at theheart of our debate today on the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  calling on members to promotesocial progress and better standards of life in largerfreedom. That message was prophetic at the time. Thefounders of the United Nations already foresaw thatbeyond the massive destruction of 1939 to 1945  afundamental poverty afflicted almost every country andregion in the world — a poverty that had to be foughtunwaveringly.Today  we salute their hope and their desire tocreate a better  safer and more prosperous world.Among the surest ways in which to create that type ofworld are the growing participation of women ineconomic  civil and political life and the emergence ofa middle class  both of which justify hope for realprogress on the road to growth. Those promising trendsneed to be accelerated.The United Nations has played a fundamentalrole on that front. Its specialized agencies and affiliateshave helped set development objectives and havedelivered the bulk of international aid. Thanks to thoseefforts  the world is a better place to live in today. Andtoday  five years after the Millennium DevelopmentGoals were adopted  the United Nations is where theworld’s nations recall their common commitment todevelopment  with a keener understanding  since theMonterrey summit  of the obligations that we all mustbear.With respect to the four major objectives of theCharter  comparing ideals against reality inevitablybrings disappointment. For each major step forward there have been many failures  in particular the absenceof a collective will to adapt our institution to currentneeds.Where are we now  and what do we need to do tobetter respond to our hopes? The starting point isclearly the document (resolution 60/1) approved byheads of State or Government last week. Thatdocument is a foundation on which  with a great dealof political will on the part of all Members  we canthink of renewing the United Nations. In any case  wehave a working framework for the years to come.I am especially pleased that the documentincludes strong references to development and to thevalues and principles that inspire us. The declarationalso provides clear  important directions on UnitedNations management  transparency and accountability.But we need to go much further in that direction.I would now like to address some of the pointsraised in the declaration. First is the “responsibility toprotect”. In recognizing that responsibility  this bodyhas taken a step that goes beyond utterances of “Neveragain” — a step that brings us closer to making15genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanitythings of the past. We now need to implement it.Secondly  with respect to the Human RightsCouncil  Canada is disappointed that members did notshow greater courage. We have not established theCouncil; we have only the mandate to work on thatissue this year. We need such a Council because it willhelp us take an in-depth look at situations of concern tous  such as that in Iran. Canada’s position is clear: theCouncil must be a permanent body  with memberselected by a two-thirds majority  on the basis ofspecific criteria  and it must provide for a system ofpeer review  starting with the countries that will sit onthe Council. I am pleased  however  that the HighCommissioner for Human Rights will have a biggerbudget.(spoke in French)Thirdly  let me turn to the PeacebuildingCommission. Here again  our work is unfinished. Areference to a sequential relationship between theSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Councilcould have been a solution to the question of relationsbetween the Commission and existing bodies.The fourth point is global health. The UnitedNations must make every effort to protect threatenedpopulations. HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria stillplague the world  to our collective shame. We have ashared responsibility to eliminate those diseases; wecan and must do better. We need to prepare forpandemics  including avian flu  on which Canadarecently hosted an international meeting of healthministers.Fifthly  with respect to terrorism  the attacks thattook place this past summer in London  in Egypt andelsewhere make it more necessary than ever that therebe a global convention in the war on terror.But we must also bear in mind that the overallglobal security architecture must be strengthened  fromlight weapons to weapons of mass destruction including the whole range of disarmament and armscontrol measures. We can certainly be heartened by theprogress that is being made in the Middle East  Haiti the Sudan and Afghanistan  high-priority regions forCanada and where United Nations action is oftenexemplary. But that success remains fragile  and thecommitment of the United Nations must continue.Sixthly  concerning the environment  if we wantto leave future generations a planet that is a healthyplace to live  we need jointly to manage itsenvironment. In less than two months  Montreal willplay host to a climate-change conference that shouldrepresent a milestone in terms of our common thinkingand action in the face of that phenomenon. We will bediscussing the progress made in implementing theKyoto Protocol and new possibilities for action in thedecades to come.Let me conclude with a few thoughts on what thefinal document does not say  or at least does not saywell.First  on disarmament  it is deplorable that aUnited Nations outcome document could contain notone paragraph on disarmament and non-proliferation ata time when we are debating Iran’s and North Korea’snuclear programmes.Secondly  on women’s rights  it is deeplyregrettable that the document could not even reiterateas forcefully the commitments made 10 years ago inBeijing or Cairo on women’s rights and genderequality  despite the fact that they lie at the very heartof the Millennium Development Goals. All MemberStates need to implement their provisions and movefrom promises to action.Thirdly  on the International Criminal Court Canada regrets the absence of any reference in thedocument to the International Criminal Court  as wellas its silence on commitments to end impunity. It isimperative that the United Nations address the issue ofimpunity. Two years ago  when the Rome Statute cameinto force  the Secretary- General clearly stated that“the time is at last coming when humanity no longerhas to bear impotent witness to the worst atrocities because those tempted to commit such crimes willknow that justice awaits them”.We urge all States to sign and ratify the RomeStatute. Together  we will break the cycle of impunity and justice will be done for the victims of such crimes.We are meeting in New York today to help solvehumanity’s problems. But while this Hall has witnessedtoo many unresolved debates and far too much costlyinaction  the challenges and problems we discuss lie farafield. Over the years we have confronted gravechallenges in the Sudan  Haiti  Kosovo and Rwanda and in many other places. In some cases  we can hold16our heads high; in others  we need to recognize  andlearn from  our mistakes and failures. I think we havecharted the course  but we still have far to travel."
"30",1233,"CHE",60,2005,"I would like to congratulate you Mr. Eliasson  on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly and to assure you of my country'sfull support during this sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly.Reform will be a central theme at the Assembly'ssixtieth session. Allow me to focus on four institutionalreforms  by which Switzerland sets great store. Theyare  first of all  the creation of a Human RightsCouncil; secondly  reform of the Security Council;thirdly  the Peacebuilding Commission; and  fourthly internal management of the United Nations.The creation of a Human Rights Council iscrucial. The Commission on Human Rights in itspresent form suffers from various defects. We deploreits weak capacity to respond to grave human rightsviolations. We also regret its overly selective characterand the application of double standards  whichundermine its authority.Switzerland welcomes the decision made by theMember States at the summit to replace theCommission on Human Rights with a Human RightsCouncil. However  we regret that it has not beenpossible  even at this stage  to establish some of theworking methods on which there was wide agreement.For Switzerland  this Human Rights Councilshould be a principal organ of the United Nations orshould at least be directly subordinate to the GeneralAssembly. It should convene periodically  be based inGeneva and should work in close cooperation with theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights. It should be of a size that guaranteesboth its legitimacy and the capacity to work effectively.Finally  to ensure real added value  it should incorporatethose instruments that constitute the strength of thepresent Commission without reproducing its defects.The profile and working methods of the HumanRights Council should be established promptly. Wehave given ourselves until the end of the sixtiethsession of the General Assembly to do this  but theideal solution would be to complete the work beforethe next session of the Commission on Human Rights which starts next March.We now need a clearer picture of the processwhich the President of the General Assembly intends toconduct. We assure him of our strong support in thistask. Switzerland hopes that the future Human RightsCouncil can start its work soon  and it invites all Statesto strive towards this goal.Switzerland has also been actively involved in thereform of the Security Council  an organ that embodiesboth the strengths and the weaknesses of the UnitedNations. No one can deny that the composition of theSecurity Council should better reflect contemporarygeopolitical realities. Enlargement of the SecurityCouncil will make it more representative and willstrengthen the authority of its decisions. However enlargement of the Security Council  which has beenthe subject of intensive debate over the past fewmonths  is only one aspect of the reform that needs tobe made. It should not overshadow anotherindispensable part of the reform: the need to improvethe Council’s working methods.For most countries  opportunities to sit on theSecurity Council are few and limited in time. A seriousreform of the Council's working methods would havean immediate and beneficial effect for all MemberStates. New and more detailed rules should be adoptedin a General Assembly resolution and then written intothe Security Council's rules of procedure.Reform of the Security Council’s workingmethods must achieve several goals: it should increasethe possibilities for participation by States that are notmembers of the Council; it should ensure greateraccountability of the Council to all the Member Statesof the United Nations; and  finally  it should improvetransparency and find new ways for the Council to hearother points of view.Efficiency is a fourth criterion that needs to betaken into account. Improvements in the working methodsof the Security Council must be geared towardsstrengthening its capacity to efficiently exercise itsresponsibilities for international peacekeeping andsecurity.In May Switzerland presented a series of specificrecommendations that were well received by manyMember States. I would like to focus on three specificproposals.First  in accordance with the principle of theresponsibility to protect  the right of veto must not be18exercised in cases of genocide  ethnic cleansing orother grave and large-scale violations of internationalhumanitarian law or human rights. I believe that thatprinciple is sufficiently clear not to require furtherelaboration.Secondly  the Security Council should refrain  asfar as possible  from exercising legislative functions.The task of codifying and developing international lawshould remain the primary responsibility of the GeneralAssembly  which includes all Member States. TheCouncil is authorized by the United Nations Charter totake emergency measures to maintain internationalpeace and security. However  that authorization cannotbe interpreted as including the power to imposelegislative obligations  that is  obligations that aregeneral in scope  abstract and have no time limits.Thirdly  on the subject of Security Councilsanctions  the procedures for establishing and revisingthe lists of targeted individuals and entities must beimproved. It is unacceptable that people who aresubject to sanctions that affect their basic rights aredenied all right of appeal. In particular  it is importantto ensure the right to be heard  which is a fundamentalhuman right.Switzerland  together with other countries intends to present a draft resolution on improving theworking methods of the Security Council.Another important institutional reform decided atthe summit is the creation of a PeacebuildingCommission. Switzerland has contributed its ideas tothat project over the past few months. It welcomes thecreation of that body  which will address a key area ofUnited Nations activities and fill a clear institutionalgap.Once a conflict has ended  the main players -institutions  States and civil society - must worktogether to rebuild the country. The principal missionof the Peacebuilding Commission will be to bring thoseplayers from the fields of peacekeeping  humanitarianaid  and development together to define joint strategiesfor future action.The Commission will include representatives ofthe Security Council and the Economic and SocialCouncil  as well as representatives of the principalfinancial donors and troop contributors. Switzerlandbelieves that the main United Nations institutionsconcerned should also take part in the deliberations.For instance  it would be useful to include theChairman of the United Nations Development Group the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairsand the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Itwould also be useful to bring on board  as needed experts from civil society  the academic world or theprivate sector.Furthermore  in the composition of theCommission  we need to ensure gender parity.Peacekeeping  humanitarian action anddevelopment are parallel activities and should not berigidly divided into successive phases. In drafting itsmandate  we should ensure that the Commission hasthe ability to advise all the institutional actorsconcerned at any step of the peace and reconstructionprocess.We cannot speak of improving the efficiency ofthe Security Council without discussing theimprovements that have to be made in the internalmanagement of the United Nations. The SummitOutcome document sets out the most urgently neededmeasures. They must be implemented without delay.In that context  the three following factors mustbe taken into account: first  the political competenceand responsibility to decide the budget belong to theGeneral Assembly; secondly  the Secretary-General'smanagement authority must be extended; and  thirdly the internal oversight bodies must be strengthened.The scandals that have tarnished the image of theUnited Nations in recent months underscore the urgentneed to strengthen the means as well as the financialand operational independence of the Office of InternalOversight Services. Furthermore  given the increasingcomplexity of their task  we must strengthencooperation between the various oversight bodies which are spread across the United Nations system. Weinvite the Member States to support the enlargement ofthe mandate of the Office of Internal OversightServices  so that it is able to respond to requests forassistance from the specialized agencies.Especially close to my heart is the importance ofcombating cases of abuse and sexual exploitationcommitted in the context of United Nations peaceoperations. Such abuses are a grave violation of humanrights and of the values that the Organization espouses.They damage the credibility of the Organization andhinder the accomplishment of its missions on the19ground. Switzerland advocates zero tolerance on thisquestion. We strongly support the measures that haverecently been taken  in particular an increase in thenumber of resident investigators deployed on theground under the authority of the Office of InternalOversight Services.Last autumn  we embarked together on a majorundertaking: adapting the multilateral system so that itcan address the new problems and challenges of thetwenty-first century  with a strengthened and moreefficient United Nations at its centre. All reformrequires a subtle mix of ambition  realism and patience.We have come part of the way. The basic itinerary wasset at the summit. We must now pursue the path ofreform  give shape to our early decisions  and resolvepersisting differences. That has to be one of the mainobjectives of the sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly  which has just begun."
"31",1279,"CHL",60,2005,"I ampleased to commend the President  and the other29members of the Bureau on their election. We assurethem of our full willingness to cooperate in the tasksfacing us.We arrived at this session of the GeneralAssembly with the same conviction and resolve that wehad 60 years ago. We still believe that this is the placewhere we can collectively promote human rights development  solidarity and peace. The politicalagreement reached last week  although it did not meetall our expectations  enables us to embark on the pathtowards comprehensive and balanced renewal of theUnited Nations system. We have the necessarymandates to begin renewal during this session. Thatmust be possible  because our interest is the interest ofhumanity.We have here an exceptional opportunity tostrengthen multilateralism and to build it within thegenuine framework of international coexistence.Multilateralism is the very cornerstone of our foreignpolicy. In the multilateral system  negotiation andconsensus are the tools to create international regimesthat promote globalization in a legitimate and effectivemanner. The United Nations is a unique forum in thatprocess  and we must strengthen it in order to achievethose goals. Hence  the urgent need to implementUnited Nations reform.We believe that multilateralism can furnish usboth with more and better instruments to allow everycountry  large or small  to participate in the elaborationof rules and in the allocation of the benefits ofglobalization. We are convinced that globalization ismore of an opportunity than a threat. For that reasonwe must assure the management of globalization which can be achieved only through institutions thatconform to clear  stable and equitable rules of the gamewithin the context of international law. Economicforces do not act in a political vacuum  which is whywe need both a new architecture and new workingmethods in the United Nations system.It is in that spirit that Chile has taken an activepart in various meetings concerned with therevitalization of the United Nations  promotingcomprehensive reform in the major areas ofdevelopment  security  democracy and human rights. Iwould like to touch briefly on each of those areas.Protection of human rights is  in our opinion  thecentral issue of globalization and a continuingpreoccupation in the recent history of Chile and LatinAmerica. That history has been written by the citizensand their struggles to restore respect for the dignity andrights of the individual.Indeed  human rights are a legitimate concern ofthe international community. Examination of humanrights issues by the United Nations does not constituteundue interference. On the contrary  it is the exerciseof a shared responsibility  from a standpoint ofcooperation and not of confrontation. When States areunable or unwilling to act  the Organization cannotremain indifferent in the face of genocide  ethniccleansing  war crimes and crimes against humanity.The responsibility to protect is an international moralobligation that we cannot shirk.For Chile  the decision to establish the HumanRights Council is a significant step towards universalprotection of human rights. We hope that before theend of the session  its characteristics  including itsstatus as a permanent organ  will have been defined.The election of its members by a two-thirds majority ofthe Assembly  as we propose  will strengthen thatorgan’s legitimacy.Comprehensive reporting by the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner would alsoenhance the credibility of the multilateral human rightssystem. In order to avoid the politicization andselectivity that are harming United Nations humanrights work  a peer review system would promotegreater cooperation  with all countries subject toobjective evaluations — particularly for those thataspire to seats on the Human Rights Council.Democratic values are cross-cutting: they applyto the citizens who participate in the life of acommunity  they underlie the organization ofgovernment and public institutions  and they are alsothe linchpin of international coexistence. Democraticvalues are a priority on the multilateral agenda andshould be reflected in the active commitment ofMember States to promote and defend democracy. Itwas that interest that has motivated Chile’s effortswithin the Community of Democracies.While some peoples and regions are part ofglobal society and participate in decision-making andin the distribution of global output  others aremarginalized and lack access to those benefits. Thatsituation raises important questions about democraticparticipation. It is therefore essential  if we wish toconsolidate democracy in the world  to move30decisively to eliminate inequality and to abolishexclusion. A better quality of democracy is linked tosocial integration and poverty relief.In that connection  the Millennium DevelopmentGoals represent a global commitment to fundamentalrights  with social underpinnings  that must beachieved in order to effectively consolidate democracyand uproot moral indifference towards the unprotectedof the world.The deepening of democracy must aim atinstitutional capacity-building in order to meet thedemands of society in an effective and transparentmanner. We have been working along those lines in theOrganization of American States  in particular throughthe Inter-American Democratic Charter  seekingformulas and instruments to improve democraticgovernance. Chile believes that that is an area in whichthere should be close cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional organizations.The reaffirmation of democracy as a universalvalue by heads of State and Government in theoutcome document represents concrete progress in theconsolidation of a new international regime for thepromotion and protection of democracy and the rule oflaw.The creation of the United Nations DemocracyFund gives us a new forum for cooperation to helpstrengthen and consolidate democracy around theworld. In April  108 countries from all continentsagreed on the “Santiago commitment: Cooperating forDemocracy”  which contains guidelines for action.We have fully endorsed the concept ofmultidimensional security in order to meet old and newthreats. Indeed  the incorporation of the concept ofhuman security at the United Nations is an importantcontribution to the process of renewal. The definitionto be formulated by the General Assembly shouldincorporate the progress achieved by the HumanSecurity Network  in which Chile has activelyparticipated from the outset.We were greatly discouraged that no agreementwas reached to include the topic of disarmament andnon-proliferation in the reform process. That is a topicthat must not be dropped from the United Nationsagenda. We therefore supported the Norwegianinitiative  which succeeded in bridging the gapbetween opposing positions. Unfortunately  despitereceiving the support of nearly 80 countries  theinitiative did not find a place in the outcome document.We will continue to work for its adoption.In addition  we are convinced that terrorism mustbe tackled through a global and sustained strategy  withthe cooperation of all States and international andregional organizations  in accordance with the Charterof the United Nations and international law and withfull respect for human rights. We must thereforechannel our strong condemnation of terrorism in all itsforms and manifestations into the political will toconclude an international convention against terrorismbefore the end of the session.The decision to establish a PeacebuildingCommission is one of the major successes of thereform agenda  as it will enable the Organization toprovide an institutional and integrated response inpost-conflict situations. United Nations activitiesshould not cease as soon as a crisis ends but — to builda durable peace — should continue until institutionsare rebuilt and peaceful coexistence is restored.As Latin Americans  and aware of our globalresponsibilities  we are actively participating in theUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. We areconvinced that that joint commitment  which isstrongly regional in nature in Latin America and theCaribbean  has been helpful in enabling Haiti torecover its ability to control its own destiny. This willundoubtedly require the continuing presence of theinternational community. The elections are animportant step  which Haiti should take on schedule.Voting  however  is only the basis for self-determination: we must continue helping to create theprerequisites for a worthier future for the Haitianpeople. Moreover  Haiti could be the first trial run forthe Peacebuilding Commission.Overcoming poverty  hunger and social inequalityis the great challenge facing our peoples today.Economic development with equity is essential in orderto achieve a world truly at peace and to guaranteeindividual rights and stable democracies.A few days ago  heads of State or Governmentreviewed the implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs)  adopted in 2000. Ourcountry met over one third of the Goals and hope toachieve them all by 2015.31In order to achieve economic development withequity  each country has a responsibility to be assumeddomestically and tasks to be performed internationally.In this connection  it is essential to work to implementthe Monterrey Consensus on financing fordevelopment  so that in its domestic efforts eachcountry can enjoy the benefits of an internationaleconomic environment facilitating poverty relief andpermitting sustained development.We were among the sponsors of the Actionagainst Hunger and Poverty  which seeks to deviseinnovative financing arrangements to combat thisproblem within the framework of the internationalcommunity’s endeavours to attain the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. We need responses now  and theAction is a definite option recognized in the SummitOutcome.Chile considers it essential to bolster overallefforts to liberalize international trade for the exportsof developing countries and to achieve stable financialflows to their economies. We urge the speedyconclusion of the Doha round  to which we arecommitted  and a remodelling of the internationalfinancial architecture to promote internationalconditions favourable to the sustained growth of thedeveloping countries and to the elimination of poverty.Development  security and human rights for all arethree interdependent concepts that dominate ourexistence as societies and that must be adequatelyreflected in a comprehensive reform process. We haveembarked on the decisive stage of the road to renewal;we are all responsible for reaching the end.We must make progress towards consensus onSecurity Council reform so that that organ can moredemocratically represent the new realities of thetwenty-first century.It is also essential to renew the Secretariat’smanagerial capacity to administer effective andresponsibly the resources that we all contribute in orderto achieve the purposes of the United Nations. Overand above the legitimate differences that are part of therichness of our diversity  we must build universalagreements reflecting common concerns to ensure thedignity of peoples and the right to live in a more secureworld.Let me conclude by saying that this session of theGeneral Assembly is a historic opportunity to promotechange. If we do not implement the agreementsachieved  hiding behind national interests or narrowcultural visions  we shall be failing to respond to thefeelings and expectations of millions of human beingswho aspire to understanding among civilizations  aglobal alliance for development and a reaffirmation ofthe underlying values of the United Nations. Let us notmiss this opportunity. If we do not act collectivelytoday  tomorrow may be too late."
"32",1325,"CHN",60,2005,"May I begin by extending my congratulations on yourelection as the President of the General Assembly at itssixtieth session. I am confident that under yourguidance this session will achieve fruitful results. I alsowish to take this opportunity to express my sincererespects to Mr. Jean Ping  President at the previoussession  and to the Secretary-General.This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of theend of the world war against fascism and the foundingof the United Nations. Just a few days ago in this Hall world leaders solemnly adopted the outcome documentof the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1).Now  it falls to us to fulfil the important and pressingtask of working towards a harmonious world of lastingpeace and common prosperity by translating thatdocument into action and turning fine words intoreality. This session should serve to promote peace harmony and common development.We want peaceful development. Progress ofmankind needs a peaceful environment. Stability andsecurity of one country cannot be built on theturbulence or crisis of another. Only a new securityconcept featuring mutual trust  mutual benefit  equalityand coordination will enable us to develop in peace andsafeguard peace through development.We want harmonious development. To build abetter future is the long-cherished dream of mankind.Any development strategy should be guided by a long-term and holistic perspective instead of immediate andsectoral benefits. Therefore  we should work togetherfor more democratic and law-based internationalrelations and a harmonious environment in whichcountries respect one another  treat one another asequals  and in which different cultures can emulate andinterchange with each other.18We want common development. No model ofdevelopment that benefits only a few countries or asmall group of people is acceptable or sustainable.Countries should cooperate with each other moreclosely so that economic globalization may yieldsuccessful results  benefit-sharing and commonprosperity.This session should serve to push forwardreforms of the United Nations and strengthen its role.Having weathered 60 years of vicissitudes  the UnitedNations needs multifaceted and multidimensionalreforms so as to be able to make a greater contributionto mankind’s noble cause of peace and development.The position of the United Nations as the core ofthe world collective security mechanism must bestrengthened so that it can perform its duty ofsafeguarding peace in a more effective way. Chinasupports the efforts to enhance the Organization’scapacity on conflict prevention  mediation and goodoffices. We also favour a greater role by the Secretary-General in this respect and the fostering of a preventiveculture.We support the efforts to strengthen UnitedNations peacekeeping operations  particularly withregard to rapid deployment capacity and strategicpreparedness  as well as the capacity to fully mobilizeregional organizations and their resources under theleadership of the Security Council.China supports the establishment of aPeacebuilding Commission to more effectivelycoordinate United Nations efforts in the areas ofpeacekeeping  post-conflict rehabilitation anddevelopment. In that respect  the Economic and SocialCouncil and other development assistance agenciesshould have an important role to play in theCommission.It has been our consistent position to oppose theuse or threat of force in international relations. We donot support the reinterpretation or revision of theprovisions in the Charter of the United Nations relatedto the right of self-defence. Should an occasion arisethat calls for the use of force  it is the Security Councilthat should make sound judgements and take prudentdecisions as to the merits of the situation.The international community should continue topress ahead with the international process on armscontrol  disarmament and non-proliferation; safeguardand enhance the authority and effectiveness of existingmultilateral treaties; give full scope to the role of theUnited Nations and other international organizations inthe area of non-proliferation; and seek solutions torelated issues by political and diplomatic means.The United Nations should be able to cope moreeffectively with non-traditional security threats. Wewelcome the comprehensive strategy on counter-terrorism proposed by the Secretary-General  and wehope to see the early conclusion of a comprehensiveconvention on international terrorism  taking fullaccount of the concerns of various parties  particularlydeveloping countries.In the effort to reduce and prevent large-scalehumanitarian crises  the international communityshould strictly observe the United Nations Charter respect the opinions of the countries or organizationsconcerned and  with the Security Council’sauthorization  explore  to the greatest extent possible peaceful settlement within the United Nationsframework. We oppose any rash intervention carriedout on the basis of the claim that a nation is unable orunwilling to protect its own citizens.Development should be a main focus of UnitedNations reform. Although China is a low-incomedeveloping country  it is prepared to contribute asmuch as it can to international cooperation fordevelopment. As President Hu Jintao announced at thesummit  China will take substantive steps in five areas.We will join hands with all Members to advancereforms in the area of development so as to facilitatethe resolution of development issues. The UnitedNations should put in place a fair and rationalMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) reviewframework to assess progress made in variouscountries and to monitor follow-up of internationalcooperation and aid commitments. We support thecoordinating role of the Economic and Social Councilin development-related areas.The Doha Round should embody development inits focus  paying more attention and taking actions toaddress the concerns of developing countries particularly with regard to agricultural produce andspecial and differential treatment. China has decided togrant zero-tariff treatment to some commodities from39 least developed countries  which will cover themajority of China’s imports from those countries.19China is in favour of incorporating the preventionand treatment of HIV/AIDS and the building of thepublic health sector into the development programmesand activities of various countries and of the UnitedNations. We will be submitting at the current session adraft resolution on strengthening global capacity-building in the area of public health. In the next threeyears  we plan to provide more aid and medicine todeveloping countries for preventing and treatingmalaria and other communicable diseases and to helpthem establish and reform their public health systemsand train medical personnel.The international community — particularlydeveloped countries — should take substantive steps tohelp developing countries break the vicious circle ofdebt. Such steps include substantial debt reduction andthe streamlining of debt relief procedures andrequirements. In the next two years  China will writeoff or otherwise cancel the overdue portions  as of theend of 2004  of interest-free or low-interestGovernment loans owed by all heavily indebted poorcountries having diplomatic relations with China.We call on the United Nations to give priority tohelping developing countries to strengthen theircapacity-building. China will help developingcountries train 30 000 people for various professions inthe next three years.My country also favours setting a timetable fordeveloped countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of theirgross national income to official developmentassistance. New fund-raising methods should beexplored so as to put more funds into development.China pledges $10 billion in concessional loansto developing countries in the next three years withinthe framework of South-South cooperation.The Charter of the United Nations grants theSecurity Council the primary responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security. Ahighly efficient  responsible and representative Councilserves the long-term interests of the United Nationsand the common interests of all its Member States.China supports reform of the Security Councilaimed at strengthening its authority and efficiency andimproving its working methods. The representation ofdeveloping countries  particularly African countries should be increased so that small and medium-sizedcountries would have more say in the Council’sdecision-making. No reform proposal can work thataddresses only the concerns of a few countries disregarding the interests of the majority of countries and treats developing countries in Africa and in otherparts of the world unfairly.China supports the principle of cooperation basedon democratic consultation. As reform will affect thefuture of the United Nations and the interests ofvarious parties  there should be no artificial timeframesor attempts to force decisions through a vote. Instead Member States should seek consensus through dialogueand consultation and in accordance with the principleof democratic international relations.China embraces the spirit of unity andcooperation. The United Nations family has 191Members. Unity is the source of strength. We wantunity  not division. As long as Member States respectone another’s interests  accommodate one another’sconcerns and show pragmatism and flexibility  we willbe able to find a reform path that is acceptable to all.The current session should focus on Africa.African countries make up a quarter of the UnitedNations membership  and their populations account for13 per cent of the world’s total population. If there isno stability in Africa  the world will have no peace. IfAfrica remains poor  there will be no development forthe world. The outcome document of the summit callsfor efforts to meet the special needs of Africa. I believethat that is correct and necessary.Despite the gratifying progress made in Africa inrecent years  conflicts in some of its regions havepersisted. The Security Council should pay specialattention to African problems and give them priority onits agenda. That means not only devoting more Councilmeetings to African issues  but also  and moreimportant  taking concrete actions to heed Africa’svoice  respect its views and accommodate its concerns.China applauds the mediation and good offices ofthe African Union and other regional organizationsaimed at conflict settlement in Africa. We supportclose cooperation between the Security Council andthose organizations by providing them with funds logistics and technical assistance to strengthen theirpeacekeeping and post-conflict reconstructioncapacities.African countries face difficulties in the area ofdevelopment  particularly in attaining the MDGs. More20than 300 million people are still living under thepoverty line. One third of all children aremalnourished. More than 30 million people aresuffering from HIV/AIDS. With less than 2 per cent ofthe world’s economic aggregate  Africa is weigheddown by debts amounting to $300 billion. All of thatposes a challenge to the conscience of mankind.The international community should reach aglobal consensus on African development and help thecontinent to achieve the MDGs on schedule byimplementing the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment. Those who provide assistance must doso in all sincerity and respect the right of Africancountries to make their own decisions. Assistance mustalso have a clear aim: to meet the basic and long-termneeds of the African people. Assistance is by no meanscharity or a gift; it is a response to the call for mutualbenefit and common development. Furthermore  it isour moral duty to help the needy and redress injustices.In the twentieth century  Africa shook offcolonial rule and achieved national liberation. That wasan epoch-making event. The twenty-first century willbring peace and development to Africa — it ishistorically inevitable. The Chinese people willcontinue to stand beside their African brothers andsisters on that journey of historic significance.The recently concluded Six-Party Talks in Beijingon the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue have reached animportant consensus and issued a joint declaration marking an important step forward in the Talks and acrystallization of the political will and diligence of theparties concerned. It also reflects the commonaspiration of the international community. Because itwas so hard-won  this result needs to be especiallyprized. We hope that the parties will continue to worktogether to promote further progress in the Six-PartyTalks  resolve the nuclear issue on the Peninsulathrough dialogue and by peaceful means  ensure lastingpeace and stability in the region and realize itscommon goals for development and prosperity. TheChinese Government will continue to make a positivecontribution in that regard."
"33",1359,"CIV",60,2005,"On behalf of my delegation  I wish to express mysincere congratulations on your election as President ofthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly. May Iwish you and the members of the Bureau full successand assure you of my delegation’s full support andcooperation.I would like to pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Jean Ping  who during his mandate substantiallycontributed greatly to reviving discussion of UnitedNations reform and activities for development andinternational cooperation. I would also like tocongratulate warmly the Secretary-General for hiscourageous initiatives to give our Organization newmomentum and further the fundamental ideals andprinciples of the United Nations.Mr. Hachani (Tunisia)  Vice-President  took theChair.This session is of special importance for theMember States and the Organization itself because ittakes place at a time when States are asked to speakabout thorough-going reforms of the Organization inorder to permit it to deal with the triple challenge ofdevelopment  peace and security and the promotionand defence of human rights. The summit just held onprogress in achieving the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs) was not as successful as we had hopedit would be. We can be gratified  however  that wewere able  despite the difficulties  to adopt a finaldocument reaffirming the Goals and the MonterreyConsensus on Financing for Development  adopted in2002. For the first time  we were also able to condemnall acts of terrorism  regardless of motive  of whocommits them and of where they are committed. Mydelegation hopes that we will  during this sixtiethsession  be able to adopt a general  comprehensiveconvention on international terrorism and set up aHuman Rights Council.Efforts to achieve greater justice in internationaleconomic relations have not been as successful as wehad hoped. The gap between the developed anddeveloping countries is widening. The economies ofthe developing countries are deteriorating and  in somecases  their citizens are becoming pauperized on abroad scale. The countries of the third world are beingthwarted in their efforts to develop  labouring under theweight of indebtedness  the volatility in commodityprices  barriers to access to the markets of developedcountries  inadequate official development assistanceand scarce financial resources  not to mention theconflicts and various pandemics afflicting ourpopulations. I would like to point out that indebtednessis a form of bondage and indebted economies areeconomies that function under constraints. Finding adurable  innovative and daring solution to this problemis one of the prerequisites for any resumption ofgrowth  not only in heavily indebted countries  but inmost developing countries. This is why my delegationwelcomes the recent decision to cancel the debt of 18developing countries  while we deplore  as otherdelegations have  the limited scope of that decision. Wewould like it to be extended to all African countries.5The effective liberalization of international tradecan generate sufficient resources for Africaneconomies and thus fund various education  health andinfrastructure programmes. Unfortunately  customs andtrade barriers that bear down on African exports  aswell as subsidies to agriculture in the Westerncountries  cancel out the development efforts of theAfrican countries that are already labouring under theburden of debt. Debt alone consumes four times morebudget resources than those we need for education andhealth. That is why I would like to associate mycountry’s voice with the call for justice and equity inseeking sustainable solutions to problems arising fromthe multilateral trade system. Here  I draw particularattention to access for our products to developedmarkets and the subsidies and other forms of domesticsupport granted by the wealthy countries to theirfarmers  which impair the competitiveness of ourproducts on world markets.The great challenges facing the world cannot bemet unless we do it in the overall context of sustainedsolidarity. That is why Côte d’Ivoire is glad to see newinitiatives put forward by Member States to mobilizeadditional funds or increase funds aimed at fosteringdevelopment in poor countries. We congratulate theproponents of those initiatives. We would like  interalia  to mention the allocation of special drawing rightsand coordinated measures to encourage voluntaryprivate contributions  the international financial facilitypresented by the British Government  which has beensupported by some developed countries  and areduction in the price of transferring funds frommigrants to their countries of origin. In some States those remittances constitute 65 per cent of alldevelopment assistance. We would also like to mentionthe contribution of a solidarity surcharge on air ticketsin favour of sustained development  a proposalpresented by Germany  Brazil  Chile and France inSeptember 2004 that seeks to combat hunger  povertyand fund sustainable development  in particular asregards combating HIV/AIDS and other pandemics.We hope that such new sources of financing alongwith  and as a complement to  traditional financingresources will effectively contribute to combatingpoverty in the world and bring us closer to attaining theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).Attaining the MDGs is a source of hope for theCôte d’Ivoire  which has for some years now beentrying to emerge from the socio-political crisis that hasravaged our country. In the first national Ivorian reporton the MDGs  which was issued in 2003 based on thedata provided in regard to each of the eightdevelopment goals  it clearly appears that the Goalswill be difficult to achieve by 2015 if the internationalcommunity does not continue to provide financialsupport  including the cancelling of our considerableforeign debt. So  I would like to reiterate the appeal ofthe Government of National Reconciliation to theUnited Nations and to development partners  bothbilateral and multilateral  to help us more in facing thenew challenges of rebuilding the country  in particular reintegrating internally displaced persons andrehabilitating our infrastructure  be they educational health-related  cultural  or environmental.No country can develop and protect its populationfrom need  if it cannot take effective measures againstthe diseases devastating it  such as malaria tuberculosis  HIV/AIDS and other contagious diseases which pose a serious threat to the entire world particularly the poor countries  and which representobstacles to the realization of development goals. Thatis why my delegation feels that the internationalcommunity should intensify and coordinate its effortsaimed at providing access to generic medicines forpatients in developing countries  includingantiretrovirals. When the time comes  Côte d’Ivoirewill fully support the world initiative to be launched in2006 aimed at strengthening the health systems indeveloping countries by 2010.As regards human rights  my delegation isgratified by efforts made by the United Nations tobring about respect for the human person and tocombat impunity in Côte d’Ivoire. We particularlyappreciate the visit by the High Commissioner forHuman Rights last July  the visits by variouscommissions to investigate the situation and the visitsby Special Rapporteurs. The Government is stillwaiting to hear the results of the latest internationalinvestigation  carried out by the United Nations fromJuly through September 2004  covering importantissues such as impunity  serious violations of humanrights  international humanitarian law and mercenaries.Trafficking in children has become an increasingproblem in Africa and particularly in the countries ofWest Africa. West African leaders are aware that onlyby fighting together against this shameful traffickingwill they be able to overcome it. That is why  inaddition to the bilateral agreements already established6and at the initiative of Côte d’Ivoire  nine West AfricanStates  meeting on 27 July 2005 in Abidjan  adopted amultilateral cooperation agreement to combattrafficking in children in West Africa. This multilaterallegal instrument contains binding obligations on all theStates Parties and specific obligations for countries oforigin and destination of children who are the victimsof child trafficking.As regards the resolution of conflicts on theAfrican continent  there has been notable progressthroughout the year. We are encouraged by positivedevelopments in Sudan  Burundi  Liberia  Sierra Leoneand the Democratic Republic of the Congo  whichincludes  in some cases  the satisfactory holding ofelections. Nevertheless  despite progress in conflictsettlement  we must remain aware of the fact that thesituations  generally speaking  remain fragile. Theinternational community must therefore act moreresolutely to help countries in conflict tackle thegenuine causes of the conflict  while combatingpoverty  consolidating democratic institutions andpromoting those countries’ economic and socialdevelopment.While we can legitimately rejoice at theresolution of certain conflicts  we must note that deplorably  certain situations are still far from settled.This is the case in my country  which has not yet foundthe road to peace  despite the many efforts made by theinternational community through various initiativesover the past three years  in particular the Linas-Marcoussis  Accra and Pretoria Agreements. TheUnited Nations  through the Security Council  hasinvested a great deal of energy in strengthening thepeace and reconciliation process in my country. Wewelcome all the measures taken thus far by theSecurity Council and are particularly encouraged bythe fact that more blue helmets have been sent and thatMr. Antonio Monteiro has been appointed as theUnited Nations High Representative for the elections inCôte d’Ivoire.I would like to avail myself of this opportunity tothank the international community  in particularPresident Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and otherregional and subregional heads of State andorganizations  for their readiness to help and for theiruntiring efforts to bring about a peaceful solution to theIvorian crisis. As I stand here before you  the processis practically at a deadlock and the presidential electionplanned for 30 October will not be held on that date.Holding free  fair and transparent elections withina reasonable time frame remains the main objective tobe attained if we are to have sustainable peace in Côted’Ivoire. Nevertheless  the following priority tasksmust first be carried out: disarming and dismantling ofmilitias throughout the country; the disarmament demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants following an initial pre-assembly; the restoration ofState administration throughout the national territory;the identification of electors and the establishment ofelectoral rolls — and  in that connection  the soon-to-be-operational Independent Electoral Commission is abright note; and the provision of funds fordisarmament  demobilization and reintegration and theelectoral process.Despite the current stagnation in the peace andreconciliation process  the Ivorian Governmentimplores the international community not to beovercome by disappointment  discouragement orirritation. We invite it to participate more intensivelyand resolutely in finding solutions to the fundamentalproblems of the crisis  which  alone  can guarantee thereturn of a lasting and stable peace in my country andreconcile all our sons and daughters.In that regard  the Security Council must remainactively seized of the case of Côte d’Ivoire  whichmust be kept on its agenda. In the same connection  theUnited Nations should  in my delegation’s opinion seriously consider imposing sanctions on all personswho are guilty of serious human rights violations inciting hatred and violence  obstructing the peaceprocess or violating the arms embargo throughout thecountry.The Ivorian people need peace. We realize thatthis is primarily the responsibility of the Ivorian peoplethemselves. Nevertheless  without the steadfast supportof the international community  peace will be difficultto achieve. Therefore  I call upon our commonOrganization to shoulder its responsibilities andbecome even more involved and more active in ournational peace and reconciliation process. That is itsmandate and the goal of its commitment under ChapterVII of the Charter."
"34",1402,"CMR",60,2005,"I am particularly pleased to express to you Sir  Cameroon’s heartfelt congratulations on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits sixtieth session. I wish you every success incarrying out your noble mandate and assure you of mydelegation’s full cooperation. I pay a warm tribute toyour predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping Minister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs Cooperation and Francophonie of the GaboneseRepublic. His great talent  consummate negotiatingskill and competence contributed decisively to thesuccess of the work of the fifty-ninth session. To theSecretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  Ionce again express Cameroon’s full appreciation forhis tireless efforts and dedication in the service of theOrganization and its ideals.At your wise suggestion  Mr. President  the maintheme of our debate is the implementation and follow-up of the outcome document (resolution 60/1) of theHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly.That reflects the great importance of this debate —importance clearly shown by the strong participation init. My country is pleased to add its voice to those of therepresentatives of 184 other countries  who havealready spoken during this exercise.Cameroon fully supports the outcome documentadopted at the end of that historic summit. Some wouldhave preferred that it be stronger  others that it be moreproactive. Cameroon believes it is a balanced andrealistic document with regard to all the major globalconcerns now considered to be priorities. Furthermore it is a document that reflects a new consensus on therole of the United Nations and its place in today’sinternational system.Our heads of State or Government took stock ofthe main challenges of our time and of the priorityactions that we must take together to build a genuineglobal partnership for development and to ensurelasting collective peace and security. They also set outguidelines to be followed over the next decade tocomplete the whole United Nations renewal processand the effective achievement of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The time has come tomove from words to action. Indeed  it is only byimplementing those commitments that we can measuretheir value  force and relevance.It is indisputable that the world has madeconsiderable progress in implementing some of theMDGs. But there is another undeniable fact that is farless encouraging: the situation in Africa. Africa is theworld’s only region that  with 10 years until thedeadline  is alarmingly behind in implementing theMDGs. If it does not receive substantial externalassistance very soon  most of the Goals will not beattained by 2015. Most of them may remain a miragefor a long time.We are aware that the current economic growthrate in our countries averages approximately 3 per cent. That is not sufficient to create the macroeconomicconditions necessary to achieve the MDGs. Today —particularly in sub-Saharan Africa — without large-scale job creation  revenue creation  a massive inflowof private capital or official development assistance  aneffective global and sustainable solution to the naggingissue of debt  and equitable participation in worldtrade  our efforts will be doomed to failure.For their part  the Governments of Africancountries  who have the primary responsibility for theirown development  are implementing national poverty34reduction strategies in keeping with the need to achievethe MDGs. With specific regard to Cameroon  theGovernment is tackling that with determination.Furthermore  the implementation of its PovertyReduction Strategy Paper is supported by the donorcommunity.My country has begun to review its strategy toensure that it is fully in line with the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. It is also implementing  with thesame determination  its national programme ofgovernance. Thus  the Government of Cameroon hasstepped up its efforts to combat corruption and hascommitted itself to a more transparent and effectivemanagement of public finances.My country would have liked to see moreambitious and courageous commitments adoptedtogether with a specific timetable for the developmentof Africa. Nevertheless  if the commitments made byworld leaders in the outcome document are speedilyimplemented  Africa would make considerableprogress in implementing most of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and could even — depending onthe adequate mobilization of national and externalresources and the political will to take action —achieve all those goals by the agreed date.During a recent crisis  the United Nations wasnearly shaken to its very foundations. During thoseevents  our sometimes differing views about oursystem of peace and collective security became openlyapparent. Fortunately  given the need to overcome allthe global threats that weigh on our collective security the summit reached a healthy consensus on theessential nature of joint actions that we need to take forthe peaceful settlement of disputes  counteractingterrorism and the maintenance and consolidation ofpeace.Nonetheless  the process of revitalizing theOrganization will remain incomplete until we are ableto agree on the enlargement of the Security Council.May I recall that  as the President of Cameroon  HisExcellence Mr. Paul Biya  declared on 14 September Cameroon remains faithful to the African position onreform of the Security Council. This reform isnecessary and must take place soon  bringing nationstogether rather than dividing them. This is the firmconviction of Cameroon  and my country will continue however long it takes  to work with other States toovercome our differences and forge a solid consensusin order to achieve this very important reform.Recourse to law for the peaceful settlement ofdisputes has  necessarily  as a corollary  the obligationto implement fully  willingly and in good faith thedecisions of the International Court of Justice. This ishow we understand the reference made in the outcomedocument concerning “the obligation of States to settletheir disputes by peaceful means in accordance withChapter VI of the Charter  including  when appropriate by the use of the International Court of Justice”(resolution 60/1  para. 73).Implementation of a decision of a court throughpositive negotiations is based first and foremost on apeaceful course of action  specifically on the basis of adeep commitment to the values and principlesenshrined in the Charter. In no case may that beinterpreted as an open possibility to renounce evenpartially the fundamental elements of that decision.Very much to the contrary.The outcome document of the High-level PlenaryMeeting allows for coordinating the activities of theprincipal bodies of the Organization within theframework of their mandate under the Charter for theprevention of armed conflicts and settlement ofdisputes. Cameroon therefore believes it desirable thatwe should find ways to ensure that Member States through the Security Council and in the GeneralAssembly  are informed formally of the status ofimplementation of judgements handed down by theInternational Court of Justice  as they are of theCourt’s annual activities.The Secretary-General could thus inform theSecurity Council regularly and in detail and report toMember States as is done in his report to the GeneralAssembly on the activities of the Organization.Good practices in this area would take root andinspire us all. In that way  we would be able to identifypotential sources of conflict at a very early stagethrough difficulties identified and to make timelyrecommendations to prevent them.Cameroon  which looks forward to the rapidcreation of the Peacebuilding Commission and theHuman Rights Council  counts on your wisdom toensure that the negotiating process that will lead totheir creation will be open  transparent and inclusive.35During the present session  which coincides withthe Organization’s sixtieth anniversary  we should beinspired by the visionary dynamism provided by theheads of State and Government. This is a newopportunity  perhaps one of the best opportunities along with the Millennium Summit  to make a decisivecontribution to improving the human condition andachieving an ideal world where all women  men andchildren live free from fear  hunger and disease.It is our responsibility here and now to fulfil thegenerous promises made by our leaders to humanity aweek ago. Let us do so without making excuses without seeking loopholes. Let us do it now."
"35",1446,"COD",60,2005,"It is a pleasure to joinpreceding speakers in congratulating Mr. Jan Eliassonon his election as President at the sixtieth session ofthe General Assembly. In particular  I welcome the factthat the international community has given him thehonour of being elected President of the GeneralAssembly  at its present session at which we arecommemorating the sixtieth anniversary of theOrganization. Moreover  at the present session weshall  above all  work to implement the commitmentsundertaken by the heads of State or Government tostrengthen United Nations reform and adapt theOrganization to the changes on the international stageso that it can remain the forum for coordination anddebate  an irreplaceable instrument for conflictprevention and management and the body forupholding international law and the integrity of States.I also congratulate the President at the fifty-ninthsession  Mr. Jean Ping  Minister of State and Ministerfor Foreign Affairs  Cooperation and la Francophonieof the Gabonese Republic. With his great humanqualities and his skill as a statesman  he carried out hismission with tact and personal engagement.Finally  allow me to convey to Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan the encouragement and the gratitude ofMr. Joseph Kabila  President of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  for his commitment to findinga solution to the crisis in the Great Lakes region andfor the importance that he attaches to the protection ofthe values of human dignity.Mr. Eliasson is presiding over the GeneralAssembly at a pivotal moment for our Organization. Itwould be hard not to make a connection between thehistory of my country  the President’s mandate and thedestiny of an eminent citizen of his country  Sweden who gained fame in my country for his commitment tothe cause of peace. I am referring to Mr. DagHammarskjöld  the second Secretary-General of theUnited Nations.As the President has assumed his functions inSeptember  it should be recalled that on 20 September1960  my country became a Member of the UnitedNations. And on 18 September 1961  the lateSecretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld gave his life forhis commitment to the Democratic Republic of theCongo. I pay tribute to the memory and the courage ofthat hero  as well as to the civilian and militarymembers of the United Nations Operation in the Congowho lost their lives alongside our soldiers whiledefending the sovereignty and the integrity of ourterritory.A comparison of the United Nations involvementin the Congo in 1960 and that of the present reveals anumber of similarities  including the tireless dedicationto the cause of peace demonstrated by the BlueHelmets. My country has twice benefited from peaceoperations  and we know the price paid by UnitedNations forces to save us from disaster. Our first-hand31experience of United Nations intervention strengthensour belief that now  more than ever  the world needs astrong  reformed United Nations.As discussions on Security Council reform havereached a crucial stage  it is time for us to acknowledgethat  in spite of its limitations  the United Nations —the forum of nations — has become the conscience ofhumanity. Its present and future role can be addressedonly when one reflects on recent changes in the worldand on the Organization’s capacity to adapt to the newchallenges posed by development  the debt crisis  thespecific needs of the least developed countries terrorism and the issues of human rights  peace andcollective security.In that context  it is desirable for the UnitedNations to modify its structure in order to be betterable to face new and old challenges and promote thevalues of our civilization  founded on the principles offreedom and democracy.The desired enlargement of the Security Council as envisaged  is now a requirement of the greatestdemocratic importance. But while it is necessary  it isnot in itself sufficient to ensure the harmonious andefficient functioning of the United Nations system. Wemust go further  beyond mere expansion  to realize theambitions that Member States have for the UnitedNations. Security Council reform should notovershadow the need to review the other UnitedNations organs  in particular the Economic and SocialCouncil  the Secretariat and the General Assembly with a view to strengthening their mandates  andenabling the President of the General Assembly to playa primary role in seeking solutions to internationalproblems.Also in the context of reform  my country looksforward to the establishment of the new PeacebuildingCommission and to the creation of multi-year standingfunds. That would enable countries emerging fromconflict to receive real  substantial contributions insupport of rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts andwould help those countries lay the foundations forsustainable development.The international community has invested heavilyin the work of rebuilding State structures in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and has providedsignificant support through the United NationsOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo (MONUC). I convey the deep gratitude ofthe Congolese people.In the context of the holding of transparentmultiparty elections to put an end to the crisis oflegitimacy and the endless loop of transitions  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo is taking giant stepstowards concluding the transition process. I would liketo assure the Assembly of the determination of theGovernment of National Unity to carry out thetransition in accordance with the constitutionaltimetable.The adoption by referendum of a draftconstitution by the end of the year will make theprocess irreversible. The elections must take place.And it is certain that they will take place  because ofthe great determination of the Congolese people andthe great commitment of the Government of NationalUnity. The harmonious progress in the process  despitesome logistic constraints related to the immense size ofthe national territory and the complexity of the voterregistration process  leads us to predict with confidencethat the various electoral deadlines will be met. Todate  nearly 12 million voters have been registered bearing out the enthusiasm that has been in evidencesince the start of the registration process.It is now urgent to quickly stabilize the securitysituation  including  in particular  through the promptresolution of the worrisome issue of the disarmamentof foreign armed groups  which threaten to disturb even compromise  the proper holding of elections.It should be recalled that it is urgent to supportthe efforts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo toput an end to the presence of armed groups in theeastern part of the national territory and ensure theirrepatriation  in accordance with the relevantresolutions of the Security Council  the African Unionand the Economic Community of Central AfricanStates. Adequate support for the training and equippingof our restructured and integrated armed forces  as wellas the firm engagement of MONUC  will lead thosegroups to disarm. However  the Democratic Republicof the Congo has never preferred the military option orever felt that it was the only possible way to ensure therepatriation of the foreign armed elements that haveproliferated in the North and South Kivus. Thereforewe have maintained contacts  through variousintermediaries  with representatives of the Frontdémocratique pour la libération du Rwanda  which has32kept open the possibility of sustained voluntarydisarmament followed by the voluntary repatriation ofRwandese armed elements. Two sets of consultationswere held — in March and in September 2005 — butso far they have not led to the hoped-for results. If theyfail  we will have to reconsider the option of forceddisarmament  no matter what the cost for theCongolese armed forces  to whom it will fall to enforceit.The Democratic Republic of the Congo isgrateful to the Security Council for having authorizedMONUC to take action under Chapter VII of theCharter of the United Nations  whose application hashad real results in Ituri. Recourse to Chapter VII inother areas  however  in particular in the North andSouth Kivus  has not yet had the full deterrent effectanticipated. Therefore  is it not time to consider  as theSecurity Council has wished  what assistance toprovide to the Forces armées de la Républiquedémocratique du Congo to realize the forceddisarmament of the militias? Naturally  the successfuloutcome of such an operation will also depend on thedetermination of the Democratic Republic of theCongo and of MONUC  and  above all  on the sincerecommitment of our neighbours. The latter must refrainfrom any form of negative interference that wouldcompromise efforts to neutralize the militias and otherarmed groups.Beyond our security and strictly politicalconcerns  we must also meet the legitimate needs of apopulation that for years has been deprived of its basicsubsistence requirements. The economic and socialpolicy of the Transitional Government seeks  in theshort term  to meet the requirements to combat poverty as well as to restructure the legal and financial sectorsand to help restart productive activities — areas wherea certain degree of success has been achieved. TheState budget has increased substantially  the exchangerate has been stabilized  inflation is under control and for the past three years  growth rates have ranged from6 to 7 per cent. Those favourable economic developmentshave enabled us to launch a number of recovery plansin the areas of basic infrastructure and education  aswell as in the field of health  by combating majorepidemics and pandemics.But the pace of progress in the social sphere isslow: very slow  in view of the people’s numerousexpectations. In order to consolidate the gains we havemade  we will need to pick up the pace of our activitiesand rapidly institute social initiatives that will have avisible impact. We therefore welcome thecommitments made by our bilateral and multilateralpartners to assist us in that direction.The Government of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo is well aware of the importance of regionalcooperation and of good-neighbourliness. For thatreason  we support the Secretary-General’s initiative —in conjunction with the Group of Friends of the GreatLakes Region — to organize in Nairobi anInternational Conference on Peace  Security Democracy and Development in the region.My country has been the main battleground of anarmed conflict  with a toll of over 3 million dead massive infringements of human rights and ofinternational humanitarian law  the destruction ofhospitals  schools  roads and bridges and the looting ofnatural resources and other forms of wealth. For thatreason  my country hopes to be one of the mainbeneficiaries of the special reconstruction fund that hasbeen set up within the framework of the InternationalConference on the Great Lakes region  and a priorityzone in the subregion for rehabilitation anddevelopment.The trials experienced by the Congolese people and by all the peoples of the Great Lakes region enable us to understand the aspirations for peacevoiced by other peoples. We therefore support thepeace process in the Middle East. The DemocraticRepublic of the Congo welcomes the withdrawal ofIsraeli troops from the Gaza Strip. We believe that thatinitiative is an important step forward  one that shouldbe consolidated in order to ensure peace and to put anend to the cycle of violence in that region. Thesensitivity and the complexity of that situation furtheremphasize the commitment made by the State of Israeland by the Palestinian Authority to reach a negotiatedsolution to the crisis in the Middle East.I also wish to commend the United Nations andthe African Union for their efforts to bring theelections in Burundi and the Central African Republicto a successful conclusion. The positive outcome of thereconciliation processes in those two countries  as wellas the prospects for positive developments in thesituation in the Congo  bode well for the emergence ofa new period of stability  democracy and prosperity forCentral Africa.33In view of new threats  I wish to reaffirm thecommitment of the Democratic Republic of the Congoto the principles upon which our collective security isbased. The coming years will be a time of increasedcompetition among nations in the areas of trade financial markets and research  including nuclearresearch; rapid globalization  made possible throughinformation and communication technologies  hasgiven rise at times to sometimes uncontrolledliberalization and bitter competition. It is thus ourhistoric responsibility to equip the United Nations withthe resources and structures not only to keep thepeace wherever necessary and to guarantee ourcollective security wherever it is threatened  but also tobetter address issues of economic and socialdevelopment  to establish more equitable rules of thegame for international trade  to fight collectively andeffectively against illiteracy  ignorance  intolerance epidemics  disease and natural disasters  and  naturally against terrorism  violence and injustice in all theirforms so that we can build a more brotherly  peaceful humane and just world."
"36",1493,"COG",60,2005,"I shouldlike at the outset to sincerely congratulate you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at the present session. That election is a signof confidence in your qualities as a statesman and arecognition of your country  Sweden  which reminds usof its illustrious son Dag Hammarskjld  the secondSecretary-General of the Organization  who sacrificedhis life for the cause of humanity. I should also like toexpress to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. JeanPing  Minister of State  Minister for Foreign Affairs ofthe Gabonese Republic  our heartfelt congratulationson the skill and wisdom with which he guided the workof the fifty-ninth session and successfully led thedifficult negotiations that produced the documentrecently adopted at the World Summit (resolution60/1). Finally  we commend the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his courageous and tirelessinitiatives to renew and revitalize the United Nationssystem.The sixtieth session of the General Assembly istaking place in an international situation characterizednot only by recurrent wars but also by the resurgenceof terrorist acts that spare no region in the world andby natural disasters that have plunged many familiesinto mourning. We wish to express to the Governmentand the people of the United States of America oursincerest condolences following Hurricane Katrina.Combating terrorism  like preserving ourenvironment  calls for greater solidarity. The UnitedNations  whose sixtieth anniversary we are celebrating remains the essential tool for expressing that solidarity.It is only the United Nations that will enable us to facethe formidable challenges of the future.The Congo therefore welcomes the adoption ofthe outcome document of the High-level PlenaryMeeting  which sets out the main course of action to betaken. The outcome document gives us reasons forhope about ways in which to meet the challengesfacing our world. At the same time  it gives rise tosome questions.The Congo welcomes the clear reaffirmation byall heads of State or Government of their commitmentto continue to discuss and seek solutions to the worldísmain concerns: issues of development  collective peaceand security  human rights and the rule of law  andstrengthening the United Nations.We welcome the consensus regarding the need tocreate a Peacebuilding Commission and a HumanRights Council. A Human Rights Council would together with the International Criminal Court  enhancethe effectiveness of mechanisms to promote and defendhuman rights.Institutional reform of the United Nations -encompassing  of course  all its principal organs including the General Assembly  the Security Council the Economic and Social Council and theSecretariat - like reform of the internal managementof our Organization  is both a political and a moralimperative that would enable the United Nations tomove with the times and to prepare more effectively toface the coming decades.The Congo regrets  however  that the seriousissue of disarmament was not even mentioned in theoutcome document because of a lack of consensus even though nuclear weapons  weapons of massdestruction and the illicit trade in small arms and lightweapons are the greatest threats to humanity. TheCongo reaffirms its full support for the objective ofgeneral and complete disarmament and the totalelimination of weapons of mass destruction.Africa has always been a source of concern forthe United Nations  and the Security Council with goodreason spends most of its time on Africa. We havereason to be pleased that some degree of progress hasbeen made in several countries.In Burundi  we welcome the efforts of theinternational community  which a month ago led to thesuccessful completion of the electoral process in thatcountry. We welcome the Central African Republicísreturn to constitutional order after several years ofcrisis and instability. These countries deserve increasedsupport from the international community so as toconsolidate situations that are still fragile.13In the Sudan  we welcome the reconciliationbetween the Sudan People's Liberation Movement(SPLM)  the central Government and the newGovernment of national unity  which has just beenestablished. But the reconciliation between the northand the south in Sudan should not lead us to forget thetragedy that has for two years been affecting anothersegment of the population in the west of the country namely  Darfur. We call for greater mobilization on thepart of the international community in support of theAfrican Union's efforts to bring an immediate end tothat political and humanitarian crisis.In Cote d'Ivoire  because of the differencesbetween the parties to the conflict and despite thetireless efforts on the part of the United Nations andthe African Union  the holding of elections  initially setfor October 2005  has now been brought into question.We urge our Ivorian brothers to rise above theirdifferences in the higher interest of their country and ofpeace and stability in the subregion.Peace and stability in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo determine the stability and development ofthe whole of Central Africa and the Great Lakesregion. We applaud the efforts by the internationalcommunity in support of the electoral process leadingto a successful transition in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo.Our subregion was very much involved in thoseefforts. As current chairman of the EconomicCommunity of Central African States  the President ofthe Republic of the Congo  Mr. Denis Sassou-Nguesso was assigned by his peers  following the twelfthConference of Heads of State and Government held inJune 2005 at Brazzaville  the task of promotingsuccessful transition. Pursuant to that mandate together with my colleagues from Angola  Gabon andthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  we met withthe international partners of the Democratic Republicof the Congo  namely Belgium  the European Unionand  of course  the United Nations.Concerning the Great Lakes region  the firstsummit meeting of the International Conference on theGreat Lakes  which was held in November 2004 atDar es Salaam  aroused great hopes for a return topeace  stability and development in that subregion.In a few months  the second summit meeting ofthe International Conference will be held at Nairobiand will adopt a security  stability and developmentpact  under which our countries intend to implementaction programmes and protocols in order to make areality of their desire for a shared future of peace security and development.The International Conference on the Great LakesRegion is a unique experience of regionalpeacebuilding. We very much hope that this subregionwill be the first to implement the reforms proposed bythe Secretary-General concerning peacebuilding.We would like to take this opportunity to reiteratethe appeal made by the President of the Republic of theCongo to the international community in general and tothe development partners in particular to make theGreat Lakes region a special development area.Nine of the eleven countries that make up oursubregion of Central Africa are now in a post-conflictsituation. This subject was discussed at length at thetwenty-third meeting of the United Nations StandingAdvisory Committee on Security Questions in CentralAfrica  which was held at Brazzaville from 29 Augustto 2 September 2005.We welcome the existence and work of thatcommittee  of which my country is now chair  and atthe same time we ask the United Nations to act on theoutcome of the committeeís multidisciplinary missionto Central Africa in June 2003.In the Middle East  notwithstanding thepersistence of the Israel-Palestine conflict  we welcomeand encourage the efforts made over the past severalmonths by the Prime Minister of Israel  Mr. ArielSharon  and the President of the Palestinian Authority Mr. Mahmoud Abbas  which reflect a common desireto bring about a fair and lasting solution.Consolidation of peace  restoration ofmacroeconomic balances and combating pandemicssuch as HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases  theseare the top priorities of my Government.Our Government intends to expand its activitiesto deal with other scourges. We organized inBrazzaville in June 2005 a conference ontrypanosomiasis  during which a resolution declaringtrypanosomiasis the number-one priority for publichealth  like HIV/AIDS and malaria  was adopted. Werequest that special attention be given to this disease.Concerned about preserving the environment  theCongo and other countries of the subregion entered14into a partnership agreement with the internationalcommunity in 2002 within the framework of the CongoRiver Basin Initiative.The second summit meeting of heads of State andGovernment on conservation and sustainablemanagement of forest ecosystems in Central Africawas held at Brazzaville in February 2005  and adopteda long-term strategy for the preservation of the forest fauna and biodiversity in the greater Congo basin.I wish to thank the European Union  the UnitedStates of America  France and Germany for theirsupport of this initiative.In conclusion  I wish to thank the African Groupfor having endorsed the candidacy of the Congo for anon-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2006 to2007. I would like to reassure you that we are fullydetermined to work resolutely for peace  freedom andjustice throughout the world."
"37",1540,"COL",60,2005,"Wecongratulate you  Sir  on your election and wish youevery possible success in the ongoing reform process.The celebration of the sixtieth anniversary is anideal moment to reiterate my country’s commitment tothe goals and principles of the United Nations. Weexpress our support for the task of reforming theOrganization.Colombia’s adherence to multilateralism is basedon its active participation throughout the UnitedNations process  from the signing of the Charter in SanFrancisco on the June 26 1945 to today  with many ofits agencies present in my country supporting ournational policies to solve the problems we face.It is a source of pride that many Colombians haveleft their mark on the Organization. It is worthmentioning  among others  former President AlbertoLleras Camargo  one of the first and most fierce andefficient defenders of the principle of legal equalitybetween States. He was also a champion of commondefence  which compels democratic States to come toone another’s defence should one of them be the victimof aggression.Colombia had the privilege of presiding  throughEduardo Zuleta  over the opening of the first session ofthe General Assembly. His vision of the Organizationis as valid today as it was 60 years ago  as you  Sir recently acknowledged in your speech to the Assembly.The diversity and evolution of thought are humangifts. To exercise those faculties  it is necessary forStates to guarantee democratic opportunities that alloweach individual to contribute to and compete in thequest for the collective good. There can be no room forany form of ideological stasis  which would discourageemulation  fail to recognize intelligence  and paralysecreativity in the search for solutions to people’sproblems.Recognizing diversity and the evolution ofthought is the source of our vocation for pluralism. Itguides the struggle against terrorism that we havecarried out with democratic conviction for three longyears. Now that dictatorships are expressions of thepast and democracy is an indestructible paradigm  it istime to review certain concepts that are becomingobsolete and must be replaced with more useful andcontemporary ones.The mindset that characterizes Governments asbeing of the left or of the right is a simplistic view thatproduces a polarized political atmosphere. It hastriggered irreconcilable emotions and sensitivities thatare inconsistent with the actions of our Governmentsand threaten the unity of our countries.I dare suggest that  in their place  we use fiveparameters to qualify our democracies. They aresecurity with a democratic scope; the effectiveprotection of public freedoms; transparency as a factorof confidence; social cohesion as a principle ofdemocratic sustainability; and the independence ofinstitutions. With these parameters  we can define ademocracy as institutional or only skin-deep; asgoverned by judicial order or by personal whim; asprogressive or backward  inclusive or exclusive.Colombia is working on a concept of democraticsecurity  enshrined in global security. We call itdemocratic because it differs from the doctrine ofnational security that was applied in the continent andused to suppress freedoms  punish democracy stigmatize the opposition and frustrate dissent. Oursecurity is aimed at deepening democracy. We havegone to great lengths to ensure that this process of re-establishing security is recognized as a democraticvalue by all schools of thought. We are determined thatsecurity shall be provided on equal terms  efficientlyand transparently  to those closest to the Government as well as to its most hardened opponents.In Colombia  the security problem has been theproduct of the weakness of the State in facingcriminals. We wish to reconfigure the equation and tofinally have a State that is strong enough to guaranteeColombians the effectiveness of their freedoms andprotect them from all threats. Given a democracy thatis deep-rooted and without ambiguities  no violentaction can enjoy a veneer of legitimacy; on thecontrary  it must be disqualified and branded asterrorist. We therefore express our solidarity with thosewho have suffered from the actions of terror.For three consecutive years  the number ofhomicides  kidnappings and other terrorist crimes hasfallen in Colombia. We have not yet won the struggleagainst terrorism  but we are winning it. That victory22will bring peace and progress to our country and  withillicit drugs uprooted from our soil  the world will feelgreat relief. To that end  we need the participation andsupport of the international community.The opposition in Colombia has always hadsafeguards  but today those guarantees are trulyeffective thanks to democratic security. Colombia hasalways embraced the cause of human rights  but thoseare now enjoying more tangible respect thanks todemocratic security.While strengthening citizen’s confidence in theirinstitutions  the concept of security that we profess andpractice requires those who opt for violence to ceasehostilities and prepare to negotiate a lasting peace. Thedecisive and firm action to thwart those who practiceterror  along with a generous policy for those whochoose to abandon armed intimidation  have allowedthe demobilization and reintegration of 20 000 out ofsome 50 000 terrorists. The Government’s doorremains open to negotiation so long as the agreementon cessation of hostilities remains accepted.We need the world to support our plans forreintegration. I ask members to imagine the magnitudeof the challenge. We have 20 000 formercombatants — a number that could double in comingyears — individuals who have hitherto lived by the gunand are accustomed to killing. What better contributioncould there be to peace than the definitive rejection ofillegality? To that end  we need the world’s help inproviding new opportunities for rehabilitation andsocial integration.We are implementing a law on justice and peace which is applicable to all terrorist groups. Bycomparison with earlier Colombian laws and those ofother countries  our law raises the bar in terms ofjustice and reparations for victims.We have increased fumigation to rid our countryof the illicit drugs that finance terrorism  and we areoptimistic with regard to manual eradication. By theend of 2005  some 30 000 hectares of illegal cropsshould be destroyed. We require greater support fromthe international community in order to provide ourpeasants with alternative opportunities.Democratic security has allowed investors toregain their confidence  and we have begun to see earlysigns of declining unemployment. In that way  we willfind the resources to face yet another challenge — thatof overcoming poverty and building a nation based ontotal social cohesion. Our social policy is framed by along-term vision and short-term goals under constantreview  in keeping with the Millennium DevelopmentGoals  the fulfilment of which we reaffirmed yesterdayin this Hall.I wish to cite three of the seven chapters of oursocial policy. The educational revolution is an axis ofsocial cohesion and the road towards equality  theredistribution of income  and the opening of newchannels for social mobility  without which democracywill remain incomplete.Promoting a country of owners emphasizes thefinancing of medium  small and micro enterprises inorder to overcome the barrier of access to credit  ahateful form of discrimination that hinders democracy.Comprehensive social protection  which in threeyears’ time will provide health insurance to all peopleliving in poverty  has allowed us to register progress inthe provision of child nutrition  to ensure access toeducation and to improve the well-being of the elderly.This year  500 000 families will be involved inColombia’s programme — poor families that receive aState subsidy to feed and educate their children. In thenear future  that number will rise to 1 million  inaddition to the increase budgetary efforts undertakenunder the aegis of the educational revolution. In 2006 10 million children will benefit from our nutritionprogrammes  and 570 000 elderly citizens will receivestipends to cover their most pressing needs.Our social policy also comprises ongoing effortsto strengthen alternative development programmes inorder to allow us definitively to overcome the problemof illicit drugs. Through such programmes  theinternational community has a unique opportunity tocontribute to and implement the principle of sharedresponsibility.The “forest-keeper families” programme involving some 33 000 families committed tomaintaining their areas free from drugs and tosupervising the recovery of the tropical forest  as wellas a programme to provide care to the displaced andreintegrated  will cost Colombia some $300 milliondollars next year.We stand firm in the fight against terrorism and inour conviction that a sustained and permanent victorydepends upon the success of each individual country in23the struggle for social cohesion. In projecting oursecurity policy as a mainstay of the State  we believe itto be intrinsically linked to the ongoing improvementof the social conditions of our people. The distinctionbetween authority and social policy is erroneous. Peacestems from authority  but lasting peace will require usto weave a social fabric of equity.Let this be an opportunity to draw attention to thethreat of rising oil prices and the lack of energyalternatives for poor countries that are net importers.There are already signs of disturbance that could leadto grave disruptions of institutional stability. Ignoringthat problem could raise greater obstacles in our fightagainst poverty and prevent us from achieving theMillennium Development Goals. Many countries including brotherly countries in Central America andthe Caribbean  require immediate action to helpfinance the supply of fuel and the development of newfuel sources.I would like to reiterate the gratitude of theColombian people for the effective presence andsolidarity of the United Nations in our country.We hope that the debate on the issue of reformwill further strengthen multilateralism. We also hopethat the Organization will emerge strengthened fromthat debate  in order that it may effectively promoteinstitutional democracy governed by progressive andinclusive legal processes in every country comprisingthe community of nations.Led by the United Nations  contemporarydiplomacy must become more austere in its spendingand rely more upon the Internet and moderncommunications than on travel  in order to avoidbecoming a heavy and debilitating burden uponcountries and to ensure that the resources saved onorganizations  expenditures and contractors can trulyreach communities in need. I wish to reiterate that theissue of austerity vis-à-vis world diplomacy is absentin our approach to United Nations reform  and weshould include it.Every country  as well as the United Nations  asour universal Organization  can contribute to makingthese hopes a reality and to bringing peace  securityand comprehensive development to our peoples thereby reaching the goals we set for ourselves for theearly years of this century.Our warm regards go out to the people of theUnited States  which has been battered by HurricaneKatrina. We wish to express our resolute solidaritywith those who have been its victims. It is our hopethat  in a few days  relief and rescue experts fromColombia will be on the ground in affectedcommunities in the United States.We are all committed to one task  namely meeting the social goals of the millennium."
"38",1580,"COM",60,2005,"Takingthe floor for the first time before this Assembly  it ismy genuine pleasure warmly to congratulate you  Sir on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its sixtieth session. Your election was apersonal honour to you and a recognition of thediplomatic skills that we all acknowledge. It alsoenhances the prestigious image of your country. Pleaserest assured of the support of the Union of theComoros as you complete your exalted mission.Your predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  deserves our fulladmiration and congratulations on the effectiveness anddevotion with which he led the work of the fifty-ninthsession.I also wish to reiterate our confidence inSecretary-General Kofi Annan and above all to expressour gratitude for his tireless commitment to establishinga more just  peaceful and prosperous world.Our world faces challenges and threats thatjeopardize our security and prosperity. And yet  wehave also seen unprecedented technological andscientific development. That disparity highlights thestark reversal of our human values and of the basicprinciples of promoting peace  respect for humandignity and international solidarity.Is there any need to list the modern scourges thathave engulfed every region of the world: extremism terrorism  ethnic cleansing and others? In addition tothat stark assessment of the state of the world — aresult of the failure of the human conscience — wehave also been struck by natural disasters  includingfloods  hurricanes  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions tidal waves and  sadly  many others.To cite just the most recent example  HurricaneKatrina  which devastated Louisiana  is a strikingillustration of that phenomenon. Through me  theGovernment of the Union of the Comoros offers itsdeep sympathy to the United States of Americaauthorities and the entire American people.Like the victims of natural disasters  the victimsof violence and human injustice have no recourse otherthan this Organization  entrusted with the most noblemission of defending and preserving their dignity. Butthe Organization will need a new impetus to spurinternational action worthy of the expectations of ourpeoples.We must therefore redefine our vision of worldsecurity. We must keep the human being at the heart ofour considerations and take every parameter of humansecurity into account. Indeed  there can be no lastingpeace while poverty  disease  despair  war andoppression persist. In a word  there can be no peace ifwe are insecure about our daily lives and the future.There is an ineluctable link between peace and thedevelopment to which we all aspire. We must thereforeset ourselves a code of good behaviour and create a lifein which the law reigns supreme.We must reinvigorate and re-energize the UnitedNations in order effectively to prepare it to face theproblems of the modern world. At the same time  thecomposition of its bodies should be as representative aspossible so as to enshrine and embody its universalityand safeguard the sovereign equality of States especially the smallest among them. As the supremeglobal institution  the United Nations should alsooperate on the basis of rules and norms recognized andapproved by all  which will strengthen its credibility.Only thus will we will truly be able to solve theproblems of terrorism  addressing them at their roots and express our sympathy for and solidarity with thosewho have devoted their entire lives to fightingexclusion and injustice.At this very moment  I have a deeply consideredthought for all those who have fought for noble causesthroughout the world. The brotherly people ofPalestine offers a perfect illustration thereof. Indeed the aspirations of the Palestinian people are those of anation reclaiming its dignity and security. In theinterests of all the peoples of the Middle East  thepeace process must continue  because building andmaintaining peace is essential to our world. It is criticalthat a Palestinian State be established and allowed tolive in peace  security and stability with the State ofIsrael and its other neighbours.19My country welcomes Israel’s withdrawal fromthe Gaza Strip  a decisive step in the quest for a timely just and equitable solution to that long drawn-outproblem. We are convinced that this gesture augurswell for the region and peoples concerned.As for Iraq  adequate conditions must beestablished to promote genuine progress towardspeace  which will guarantee the stability necessary tothe country’s socio-economic development.The situation in Asia also deserves the focusedattention of the international community. The stalematein the issue of the Chinese province of Taiwan  to citejust one instance  is not conducive to the promotion ofstability in that part of the world. That is why  in itsconcern for the ongoing prevalence of law ininternational relations  and in order to guaranteerespect for the national unity of countries  the Union ofthe Comoros urges the General Assembly to heed thelegitimate claims of the Government of the People’sRepublic of China over the Chinese province ofTaiwan.With regard to Africa  we welcome the imminentsettlement of certain crises  including in the Republicof the Sudan  where current developments are openingthe prospects for effective national reconciliation. TheGovernment of the Union of the Comoros encouragesthe Sudanese parties to persevere along that path.As to other crises that remain unresolved  weurge the international community to play a lead role infinding solutions. Indeed  stability remains aparamount condition for the success of Africa’seconomic development efforts through the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development and otherregional and international initiatives seeking the samegoal. Likewise  those efforts will remain inconclusiveso long as HIV/AIDS  malaria  drepanocytosis andother diseases continue to rage in our countries. Otherthreats include drought  famine  locust infestations extreme poverty and the debt burden stifling theeconomies of our countries. We therefore commend theinitiative of convening a summit to assess theMillennium Development Goals  which should allowfor the adoption of new arrangements for theachievement of the Goals by 2015.Environmental problems affect all States and area source of genuine concern to us all. Unbridledpollution  the destruction of the ozone layer deforestation  rising sea levels — in a word  theceaseless deterioration of the environment — requireus all to heighten our awareness of those global threats.And yet  while such problems may affect anynumber of States  we should recall that some — thesmall island developing States in particular — havespecific characteristics that must be taken intoconsideration and addressed with greater attention. TheUnion of the Comoros itself recently suffered avolcanic eruption that severely damaged ourenvironment. Such continuous threats to our countriescall for the timely establishment of mechanisms toprevent and manage natural disasters.We welcome regional initiatives  including thoseundertaken by the Indian Ocean Commission  to bettermanage such situations and we urge the internationalcommunity also to provide us with its invaluableassistance. I take this opportunity to thank theGovernment of France  the United NationsDevelopment Programme  and all other friendlycountries and specialized agencies of the UnitedNations that have greatly helped us to grapple with andmanage that disaster.I spoke earlier of the inequalities prevalent in ourworld. They are manifest at many levels  to be sure  butthe socio-economic aspect is the most glaring. Longmarginalized in world decision-making  our countriesof the South continue to suffer the consequences of oureconomic fragility. The rules of the game in worldtrade exclude us de facto from the playing field.Moreover  the paucity of new information andcommunications technologies in the South is a strikingreminder of the vast abyss in that field between ourcountries and those of the North.Debt continues to burden many countries of theSouth  despite the fact that  thanks to a sudden surge ofgenerosity and  above all  responsibility on the part ofthe wealthy countries  some saw their situationrevisited and improved by the cancellation of theirdebt. That only highlights the urgency of the need toassess the economic and financial situation of thecountries of the South in order for them to begenuinely integrated into the dynamic of globalization.If the disparities in and slow pace of theachievement of the Millennium Development Goals ingeneral are to be redressed  a world partnership isneeded. In that context  special attention must be paidto the least privileged social strata  including by20providing access to financial services through thepromotion of microfinancing and microcredit.Furthermore  we must address and objectivelyanalyse the issue of debt. We must prioritize thecancellation of the public debt of the heavily indebtedpoor countries  the least developed countries  and thelow- and medium-income developing countries.Finally  international action should promote a fair regulated  open and non-discriminatory trading system notably by facilitating the developing countries’accession to the World Trade Organization.The United Nations is an irreplaceable forum. Asthe crucible of our warning cries and our hopes for abetter world  it remains the perfect framework fordiscussing the world situation and for opening awindow on the situation in each of our countries.With respect to the Union of the Comoros  I ampleased to announce from this rostrum that we havecompleted our establishment of new institutions  whichare now operational. We thank everyone for theirimportant contributions to that end. We now have thetwo-fold duty to consolidate the valuable achievementsof national reconciliation and to promote our country’ssocio-economic development.With our development partners  we are thereforestriving to reinvigorate our cooperation and redirect ittowards the well-being of our people. In the same vein the achievement of the Millennium Development Goalsis a priority of the Government of the Union of theComoros.Furthermore  my country completed a staff-monitored programme of the International MonetaryFund in January 2005 and is working to streamline itspublic finances with a view to concluding a Facility forPoverty Reduction and Growth programme with theBretton Woods institutions so as to mobilize thefinancial resources necessary to implementing itsdevelopment priorities.In that respect  the Comoros authorities are alsoattempting to implement a recommendation from theinternational community to convene a donorsconference on our behalf. I therefore have the pleasureof informing the Assembly that such a meeting  criticalto my country’s economic and social future  will beheld on 8 December in the Republic of Mauritius underthe auspices of the African Union. On behalf of mycountry  I call on the international community to helpus to ensure the gathering’s success.I also take this pleasant opportunity warmly tothank the Republic of Mauritius for its generous offerto host that important conference. In particular  we thankMauritian Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam forhis readiness to co-preside the conference.In the same vein  on behalf of the Government ofthe Union of the Comoros  I pay a well-deservedtribute to the Republic of South Africa for its ongoingsupport for the Comoros and for having successfullycoordinated the efforts of the African Union and ofregional countries to achieve national reconciliation inmy country. The people of the Comoros sincerely andhappily welcome the tireless interest of Mr. ThaboMbeki  President of the Republic of South Africa  inthe future of our country and his willingness to co-preside the donors conference.I cannot conclude without raising here the issueof the Comorian island of Mayotte. Following a seriesof consultations held between French and Comorianauthorities in their common concern to find a solutionthat will preserve the friendship and cooperationbetween the two countries  safeguard the interests ofboth States and satisfy the aspirations of the entirepopulation of the archipelago  a new process has beenlaunched. It will promote direct dialogue between thetwo parties with a view to finding a solution thatprotects everyone’s interests in accordance with thelaw.The Comorian Government has invested a greatdeal of hope in the new dynamic. It believes that it cantrust the French Republic to strive for a joint andhonourable resolution of the situation. I therefore takethis opportunity to reaffirm my sincere thanks to all thefriends of the Comoros  who have never failed in theirsupport  their encouragement and their solidarity withmy country in the quest for a solution to the issue inline with the law. I also wish to assure them  on behalfof the Government of the Union of the Comoros  thatthey will always be kept up-to-date on developments inthe issue and  whenever necessary  involved in theprocess.Working for peace means fighting all that fuelsextremism and every source of frustration. Working forpeace also means investing all necessary resources indevelopment  without which humankind has no dignity.The health of our world depends on our Organization.21Let us strive for its renewal  for more peace  forhappiness and for greater human dignity. Let us strivefor equal opportunity for all."
"39",1619,"CPV",60,2005,"I would like to expresscongratulations and support to the President of theGeneral Assembly for having chosen as the theme ofour debate  “For a stronger and more effective UnitedNations: follow-up to and implementation of decisionsmade in the High-level Plenary Meeting of September2005”.Ten years before the target date  we are still facedwith doubts and questions about the actualachievement of the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs)  particularly in Africa. There are twointerconnected elements at the heart of this matter:States’ development policies; and the effectivefulfilment of the commitments entered into by theinternational community. I have no intention ofevaluating national policies  but it is clear that theachievement of the MDGs will require far-reachingadjustments in our national policies and increasedefforts to reorganize and manage our budgets.Furthermore  the emergence of a new Africanleadership  which is bringing us together again in ourcommitment to promoting development  democracy peace and political stability  is an opportunity for theinternational community to provide more consistentsupport for the achievement of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.Unfortunately  despite a great deal of discussionabout the MDGs  we are still falling short with regardto the commitments undertaken  to the clear distress ofthe populations afflicted by pandemics such as malaria tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS  which is spreading at analarming rate.As the head of State of Cape Verde said whenaddressing the Assembly during the High-level PlenaryMeeting last week (see A/60/PV.5)  achieving theMillennium Goals and building a freer world based onhigher levels of well-being  tolerance  peace andsecurity are within reach for humankind.In order to achieve our goal  we need politicalwill  not just statements about political will or piousexpressions of hope for development. It is theresponsibility of the General Assembly at this sessionto ensure that the summit outcome (resolution 60/1) iseffectively implemented. However  there can be nodoubt that the implementation of the outcome will be atest of the policies that have been set out  as well as ofthe negotiating skills of Member States  as we strive toachieve a better balance on international relations further the democratization of international governanceand strengthen peace and security at the regional andnational levels. We must redouble our efforts this year.In the context of the reforms proposed by theSecretary-General  Cape Verde has been chosen to hostthe joint office initiative  with the participation ofUnited Nations programmes and agencies in the field.May I once again reiterate my Government’s supportfor this initiative  while at the same time emphasizingthe absolute need for there to be adequate preparationfor this experiment  as well as internal adjustmentsconsistent with the option of joint representation. Weare convinced that the joint office initiative will makeit possible to concentrate resources more effectively onpriority challenges and the substantive aspects ofdevelopment.On 5 July 2005  the Republic of Cape Verdecelebrated the thirtieth anniversary of its independence;these 30 years have been marked by considerablesacrifice and effort in a country without naturalresources. Throughout this period  fortunately  all the27development indicators have shown upward movement.Under a resolution adopted by the General Assembly inDecember 2004  Cape Verde has made sufficientprogress to be no longer included in the list of leastdeveloped countries. This “graduation” is an explicitrecognition of the work done by the people of CapeVerde; and  undoubtedly  it is also the result of theinternational aid provided by various partners.Therefore  I should like to take this opportunity toexpress to all of Cape Verde’s development partners both present and absent in this Hall  our profoundgratitude for the solidarity thus extended to us.At the risk of repeating myself  I should like torecall the following points. The “graduation” of CapeVerde is a result of the fact that the country satisfiedtwo of the three established criteria. I am referring tothe per capita income per inhabitant and the humandevelopment index. The failure to identify the thirdcriterion  that of economic vulnerability  which is byfar the most important one  illustrates the kind offragile situations that can be experienced by a smallisland country that is permanently afflicted by droughtand external shocks  of which the increase in oil pricesis a very illustrative example.For success to be meaningful over the mediumand long term  “graduation” should be accompanied bythe appropriate measures needed to ensure continuityof the development process. It is of fundamentalimportance to define the goals  their duration and thepractical modalities for this transition  and it should bedone as quickly as possible. What has been achievedby Cape Verde  thanks to the judicious management offoreign aid  cannot obscure major structuralvulnerabilities. Parenthetically  I would like to reiterateonce again an appeal to the international community togive particular attention to the specific problems ofdevelopment in small island States.We are convinced that  when Cape Verde leavesthe group of least developed countries in January 2008 we will have agreed upon a common frame ofreference  together with our development partners  onethat is based on General Assembly resolution 59/209and is in step with the spirit of smooth transition where emphasis will be placed on questions of trade financing for development  including modalities andmore effective and innovative instruments that fit theneeds for accelerated economic growth of a“graduated” but vulnerable country.We continue to be convinced that thedevelopment target we share with our partners must notlead to our being penalized for good governance and apositive development dynamic. For our part  we willcontinue to rely on the solidarity of our partners including the United Nations.Regarding financing for development and theurgent need to adjust the practices and instruments ofaid to the requirements of achieving the MDGs  Ishould like to comment on the decision taken by theGroup of 8 to eliminate external debt. The Governmentof Cape Verde is delighted at the Gleneagles decisionto forgive the external debt of 18 countries  mostlyAfrican ones. This is a shot of oxygen for thedevelopment process of the recipient countries.That having been said  however  the Governmentof Cape Verde believes that we will need to analyse theproblem further in order to ensure that solutions areintegrated effectively into the international agenda. Onthe one hand  the situation of poor countries  which aredeeply indebted  requires an increase in solidarity. Onthe other hand  we also believe that some gestureshould be made towards the medium-income countries particularly those that are bereft of natural resourcesand only slightly indebted and who  at the same time honour their debt servicing in a structural frameworkthat is marked by budgetary constraints. Otherwise  themessage underlying the decision to pardon the debtwill be extremely ambiguous and could lend itself tovarious interpretations.I would like to end with what one normally startswith  and that is by congratulating the President on hiselection to lead the sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly. My congratulations are equally extended toSweden  his country  which has always giveninvaluable assistance promoting the self-determinationof peoples  world peace and development. I would alsolike to express my gratitude to his predecessor Minister of State Jean Ping  for the competent and wisedischarge of his functions during a period of intenseand difficult negotiations.May I finally address our gratitude encouragement and confidence to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. His vision of the future ofthe world and of the United Nations deserves to besupported by us all  so that our Organization  whichbelongs to all of us  can respond to the growing andcomplex challenges of the current world."
"40",1665,"CRI",60,2005,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate thePresident on his well-deserved election to preside overthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly. Thesession that he is chairing is special because of itsscope and the importance of its issues  particularly inview of the unfinished mandates and unfulfilled hopesof the 2005 summit.We cannot conceal our dissatisfaction with thesummit’s outcome. In some areas  such as developmentand human rights  the outcome document reflects lessthan the international community’s least commondenominator. In others  such as disarmament andimpunity  the final document is a real step back.Nevertheless  this does not mean that we shouldneglect our commitment to the reform of the UnitedNations.We must avoid past mistakes in order to ensurethe success of the next round of negotiations. TheGeneral Assembly must set realistic goals  avoidingexpectations that cannot be met or accepting artificialdeadlines that create undue pressure on thenegotiations and must not be distracted by secondaryissues. The negotiation process must be open  inclusiveand transparent  so that all States may be free toparticipate and contribute actively. We must not yieldto the temptation of creating closed negotiating groupsthat can make private and non-transparentarrangements. We must prevent small groups of Statesfrom imposing their own national ambitions uponothers. The Secretariat must remain totally impartial.And finally  we must see to it that decisions are madeby democratic means in conformity with the rules ofprocedure.Such principles must be borne in mindparticularly when we consider the possible reform ofthe Security Council. In the last few months  wedevoted a disproportionate amount of time and effort tothe question of Security Council reform  to thedetriment of other equally important issues. During thepresent Assembly session  we must give equalemphasis to the Human Rights Council  thePeacebuilding Commission and the negotiation of thecomprehensive convention on terrorism  in addition tothe reform of the Security Council. We deem itnecessary to revitalize the Working Group on thereform of the Security Council so that we may worktogether towards a consensus solution.We reaffirm our commitment to Security Councilreform in order to make it more democratic and moretransparent and effective  on the basis of the principlesof sovereign equality among States  rotation  periodicelections and accountability. Therefore  we cannotaccept having new permanent members which  due totheir permanent status  cannot he held to account andwhich cannot be replaced if their performance is foundwanting. We would only favour an increase in thenumber of non-permanent members of the Council with a possibility of re-election.At the same time  we support reforming theSecurity Council’s working methods so that it may bemore responsive to the requirements and needs of thegreat majority of Member States. It is indispensable tolimit the undemocratic instrument of the veto  whicherodes the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Council.The veto is unacceptable  especially in cases ofgenocide  war crimes  crimes against humanity andmassive violations of human rights. Regrettably  theproposal to eliminate the veto in such cases was notincluded in the summit’s outcome. This question willhave to be reconsidered in the coming months in thecontext of Security Council reform.We should focus also on the accountability of theSecurity Council to the broader membership. Insofar asthe Council acts on behalf of all Member States  itshould submit special reports to the General Assembly pursuant to Article 24  paragraph 3  of the Charter every time that it establishes or substantially modifiesthe mandate of a peacekeeping mission  every time thatit imposes sanctions or other measures of generalapplication under Chapter VII of the Charter  and everytime that a draft resolution is vetoed. The GeneralAssembly should consider such reports with a view tofurther action when necessary.17Furthermore  the Security Council must adoptmeasures to ensure full respect for human rights and  inparticular  the right to due process of persons includedon lists of sanctions committees. The work of theSecurity Council must serve as an example of thehighest standards of human rights and due process atthe international level.My delegation wholeheartedly supports all effortsto strengthen the international mechanisms for thepromotion and protection of human rights. We fullysupport the idea of transforming the Commission onHuman Rights into a Human Rights Council. We hadhoped that the outcome document would containspecific provisions on the structure and mandate of thenew Council. In their absence  we should devote thenext few months to designing this new institution. Weparticularly deem it necessary to ensure that thecomposition of the new Council reflects an equitablegeographical distribution and that its mandate mayfavour expert consideration of issues  avoidingunnecessary politicization. It is also necessary to drawa distinction between the mandate of the new Counciland the work of the General Assembly’s ThirdCommittee.We support the idea to increase substantially thebudget of the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights. We are greatlyinterested in the idea of submitting a single report to allof the monitoring mechanisms established under thevarious human rights treaties. In order to protectpersons with disabilities  we believe it necessary toconclude as soon as possible the convention onprotection and promotion of the rights and dignity ofpersons with disabilities.In the next few months  this General Assemblyshould also devote itself to the establishment of thePeacebuilding Commission. In our view  this newCommission should be a subsidiary body of theGeneral Assembly  maintaining an appropriatefunctional relationship with the Security Council. Itsmembers  we believe  should be elected  and the bodyshould be open to all States that are making aneffective contribution to peace. Therefore  we areopposed to having permanent members of the SecurityCouncil automatically become members of the newCommission. Such an unjustifiable privilege would beone more example of the cascade effect. Similarly  weare opposed to extending the right of veto to the workof the new Commission. We believe that in itsdecision-making the Commission should apply therules of procedure of the General Assembly.We are convinced that the United Nations shouldplay a key role in the efforts to fight internationalterrorism. Pursuant to the summit’s outcome document in the coming months the General Assembly shoulddesign a comprehensive strategy against terrorism andadopt concrete measures to strengthen and enhancecoordination in the Organization on this matter. In thiscontext  we would like to repeat the proposal made lastyear by the President of Costa Rica  His ExcellencyMr. Abel Pacheco de la Espriella  to create a UnitedNations High Commissioner on Terrorism  as anindependent  professional and permanent mechanism atthe heart of the Secretariat to ensure greatercoordination and better use of the resources availableat the global level to fight terrorism.We also support the conclusion of thecomprehensive convention on international terrorismby the end of this year. That draft convention alreadycontains a technical and precise definition of the crimeof terrorism  which will enhance judicial and policecooperation on the basis of the principle of “prosecuteor extradite”.We highlight the importance of law and justice ininternational relations  and thus we reaffirm ourconfidence in the International Court of Justice as thebest mechanism for the peaceful settlement of disputes.Thus  we urge all nations to accept  without anyconditions  the jurisdiction of the Court. We call uponStates that may have entered reservations in theirdeclarations of acceptance of the jurisdiction of theCourt to withdraw them.We reaffirm our support for the InternationalCriminal Court as an indispensable mechanism toprevent and punish the most serious crimes againstmankind. We are particularly pleased at the fact thatthe delegation of Costa Rica will in the next fewmonths preside over the Assembly of States Parties tothe Rome Statute.This year’s negotiations on disarmament and non-proliferation have yielded unsatisfactory results. Inparticular  we believe that the General Assemblyshould begin preparations for the review conference ofthe United Nations Programme of Action to Action toPrevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade inSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects which will be held in mid-2006. That conference18should incorporate  in the implementation of itsProgramme of Action  a human rights perspective andthe six global principles of the draft frameworkconvention on international arms transfers.Regarding development  we reiterate our appealto implement the Millennium Development Goals andurge developed countries to fulfil their commitments toallocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product todevelopment assistance and to do away with allbarriers and subsidies that have a negative impact onthe exports of developing countries.Specific measures must be adopted to enhanceprevention and assistance in case of natural disasters.In this context  I would like to recall that the Sachsreport identified Central America and the Caribbean asthe region with the highest vulnerability indices tonatural disasters. Similarly  it is indispensable to bearin mind the importance of economically sustainabledevelopment. In this context  I would like to highlightthe initiative of creating a “Rainforest Coalition”  ledby Costa Rica and Papua New Guinea  with a view toprotecting all forests and ensuring payment for theenvironmental services that they provide. We mustrecall that tropical forests benefit mankind as a wholeby sequestering the carbon dioxide produced byindustry. Unfortunately  the Kyoto Protocol does notprovide incentives to developing countries to protectprimary tropical forests. We believe that this omissionin the Kyoto Protocol must be remedied.Regarding management  and with a view tosafeguarding the unique legitimacy of thisOrganization  we deem it indispensable to strengthenthe United Nations monitoring and inspectionmechanisms  and we request that the General Assemblyconsider in depth the recommendations of the Volckerreport. It is indispensable to face with absolutetransparency the cases of mismanagement and allegedcorruption that have surfaced within the Organizationin recent months.We believe that the General Assembly shouldseriously consider the question of the representation ofthe Republic of China on Taiwan in the UnitedNations. There is no doubt that the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan could contribute to the work of theOrganization. Incorporating the Republic of China onTaiwan into the community of nations is also necessaryso that it may fully assume the rights and duties thatarise from the various legal regimes of globalgovernance in areas as varied as collective security development assistance  the fight against terrorism sustainable development and the various internationalhealth mechanisms.I would like to conclude by reiterating CostaRica’s unconditional commitment to the principles andpurposes of the Organization  reaffirming our faith inthe United Nations as the principle instrument of theinternational community to maintain peace  andrenewing our full confidence in the Organization’scapability to promote human rights and the well-beingof all peoples."
"41",1734,"CUB",60,2005,"Actually  we have no reason to celebrate the sixtiethanniversary of the United Nations. The chaotic unequal and insecure world in which we are now livingis not much of a tribute to those who gathered on26 June 1945 in San Francisco to found the UnitedNations.From the conclusion of the Millennium Summitin 2000 until today  more of the world’s children havedied of preventable diseases than all of the victims ofthe Second World War put together.The aggression against Iraq was launched  notjust without regard to  but even counter to the opinionof the international community. That happened just twoand a half years after having solemnly proclaimed atthe Millennium Summit that “We are determined toestablish a just and lasting peace all over the world inaccordance with the purposes and principles of theCharter” (resolution 55/2  para. 4). The GeneralAssembly could not even meet to discuss it. TheSecurity Council was ignored and then had to undergothe humiliation of docilely accepting a predatory warthat had earlier been opposed by a majority of itsmembers.There is a clear explanation for the current stateof affairs  which is that the order enshrined in theCharter pertained to a bipolar world and to a balance ofpower that no longer exists today. “We  the peoples” —as the Charter says — must bear the burden of aunipolar world  in which a single super-Power imposesits whims and selfish interests on the United Nationsand the international community.Therefore  trying to get the United Nations tofunction in conformity with the principles and purposesenshrined in the Charter is make-believe. It is notpossible. And it will not be possible as long as thirdworld countries  which make up the majority of theworld  fail to unite and fight together for their rights.Were the United States Government to complywith Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)  adoptedon 28 September 2001  and to the internationalconventions on terrorism  it would extradite theterrorist Luis Posada Carriles to Venezuela and releasethe five young Cuban anti-terrorist fighters who havebeen subjected to cruel and unjust imprisonment forseven years.Had the United States Government allowed theUnited Nations to act in accordance with the Charter the Iraqi people would not have been invaded so thatthey could be robbed of their petroleum  the Palestinian21people would exercise sovereignty over their territoryand Cuba would not continue to be blockaded. Norwould there be billions of illiterate people or 900million starving human beings in the world.That explains the failure of last week’s summit which was convened to assess compliance with themodest commitments entered into to fulfil theMillennium Development Goals and which ended as apitiful imitation of what should have been a serious andcommitted debate concerning the grave problemscurrently besetting humankind. It was a complete farce.It was of no interest to the powerful. Their selfish andhegemonic interests run counter to the aspiration for amore just and better world for all.The scandalous pressures and blackmail broughtto bear on Member States  after the United StatesAmbassador brandished the stick and attempted toimpose 750 amendments on the outcome document will go down in history as the most eloquent evidencethat a new world and a new United Nations must bebuilt  with respect for and recognition of the right topeace  sovereignty and development for all  withoutgenocidal wars  blockades or injustice. The finalnegotiations  from which most United NationsMembers were excluded  and the outcome documentthat was adopted  in which issues of vital interest forour peoples have been omitted  is a vivid illustration ofwhat we are talking about.While we await the day in which that new worldand the new United Nations can become a reality  we the peoples  will continue to fight and  through ourresistance  win once again the rights currently deniedto us.The powerful only talk about interventions andpreventive wars  about imposing draconian conditionsor the most efficient ways to control the UnitedNations  while attempting to legitimize concepts suchas the so-called responsibility to protect  which couldbe used one day to justify acts of aggression againstour countries. Let us spell this out clearly: today thereis no right to peace for the small.We as Cubans understand this very well  and werely on the solidarity of peoples  on our united frontand on our weapons  which have never been usedexcept to defend just causes. Our brothers and sisters inAfrica know this well.We are not pessimists; we are revolutionaries. Wedo not surrender or conform. Today  more resolutelythan ever  we affirm that “we  the peoples” willovercome."
"42",1780,"CYP",60,2005,"Before proceeding with my remarks  I wish to begin by indicating that my delegation fully subscribes to the statement delivered by the presidency of the European Union.   At the outset  Sir  let me express my sincere congratulations to you on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly and my sincere gratitude to Mr. Jean Ping  President at the fifty-ninth session  for his tireless efforts during a very crucial year for the United Nations.  With the end of the summit  we have entered a far more crucial phase  that of the follow-up and implementation of its outcome and the furtherance of the progress achieved  especially in terms of those targets which have been subject to an enforcement road   05-51226 11  map since the Millennium Summit. The realization of the content of the summit outcome document (resolution 60/1) in conjunction with reforming the United Nations  may very well decide the Organization’s relevance and standing in decades to come and with it the fate of our attempts to render effective multilateralism the cornerstone of international order. Beyond the wide spectrum of issues covered in the summit’s outcome document  we must not lose sight of those realities on which the United Nations must — and is expected to — remain primarily focused. For these  we must go back to the genesis of the Organization. In the wake of the Second World War  a vision emerged to establish a system of collective security and institutionalized mechanisms that would ensure the maximization of conflict prevention and the minimization of the duration and impact of a conflict.   Not only has the new century inherited many of the challenges and problems of the previous one  but new scourges have emerged that jeopardize the legitimacy and the very existence of our system of collective security. These require an urgent response from the international community through an action-oriented strategy encompassing the appropriate institutional framework  appropriate decision-making mechanisms and the efficient implementation of our commitments. Fulfilling our pledges in a timely manner is not a responsibility applicable only to traditional security threats. Terrorism  transnational crime and many other security deficits require our full attention in the form of elaborating result-oriented action plans. Regarding  for instance  weapons of mass destruction  although we are aware of the inextricable link between disarmament and non-proliferation  we have not yet been able to strike the kind of balance that would allow us to pursue them equally and simultaneously. And while we have identified underdevelopment and poverty as key enemies of stability  this realization is not yet adequately reflected in our actions.   The assessment of the current state of the world through the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization  which we have before us in document A/60/1  leads to the conclusion that long-standing conflicts  with all their ramifications  remain a primary source of concern for the international community. Africa is a prime example of this. Today more than ever  and rightly so  it remains at the core of our mobilization. Our endeavour to make a difference there in terms of conflict resolution  peacekeeping and peacebuilding and fighting poverty  underdevelopment and deadly diseases will be the litmus test of the effectiveness of our commitment to meet the Millennium Goals.  The Middle East is another test case. In recent weeks it has been proven that reciprocal gestures have the capacity to construct common ground  even where that does not seem on the surface to exist. Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza and parts of the northern West Bank is an important development that should lead to the implementation of the Quartet’s road map. Israel’s paradigm of removing settlers is one to be followed by other occupying Powers using settlers as a means of warfare. Even though the security situation is still fragile  and even though the political negotiation might not always be moving forward  the parties are offered a closed course in the form of the road map  which has the potential to steadily lead to progress. Furthermore  we firmly believe that the gathering momentum would be aided by strict adherence to international law and international humanitarian law  including the 4 July 2004 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the construction of the barrier.  Let me now turn to the Cyprus problem. Almost 18 months have elapsed since the April 2004 referenda on the Annan plan. Let me stress once more that in rejecting that plan the Greek Cypriots rejected neither finding a solution that would reunify Cyprus nor the urgency of achieving this. They rejected that particular plan because it did not provide for and could not bring about the reunification of the country  its society  its economy and its institutions. During this time we have not remained idle. Our priority has been to revisit the content  product and shortcomings of the last negotiation process which led to the referenda. Simultaneously  emphasis was placed on dispelling certain misconceptions that were solidified as a result of the last negotiation process.  One such misconception was that our constant and keen pursuit of peace and of achieving the reunification of our country has been diminished or that we have come to terms with the unacceptable division of our country which was imposed in 1974 by the invasion and occupation of 37 per cent of our land. The second misconception concerns the role of the United Nations in offering and continuing its good offices mission mandated to the Secretary-General by    12 05-51226  the Security Council. The Secretary-General’s mandate for the good offices mission has not come to an end but has entered a new phase with the end of the referenda. Regardless of its level of activation at different times  this mission is an ongoing and sustained process. Through it we expect the Organization to broker a negotiated settlement without any arbitration. The active contribution of the European Union in this regard would be catalytic. Only an agreed settlement endorsed by the leadership of the two communities can be put to referenda. The timetable for seeking a solution should genuinely and exclusively be determined by the parameters of the Cyprus problem  and as such there should be no deadlines embedded in the process that are dictated by exogenous elements. We remain committed to holding negotiations under the umbrella of the United Nations and to working for the creation of those conditions that will render fruitful negotiations feasible. In this context we have been implementing substantial practical measures on the ground with the aim of building confidence and promoting the economic development of the Turkish Cypriots. We hope that enhancing cooperation between Greek and Turkish Cypriots will be conducive to making progress on different aspects of the Cyprus problem  especially the elements composing its humanitarian dimension such as the fate of missing persons and the welfare of those in enclaves.  The divisive character of the most recent plan  which essentially led to its rejection  epitomized its remoteness from the essence of the problem. Another source of great concern is the apparent willingness of actors involved in the process to concede a disproportionately large number of politically driven demands at the expense of those principles that should govern the solution. It should be clarified that a settlement should be formulated on the basis of the concerns and expectations of the people of Cyprus as a whole and should not aim at accommodating the interests of foreign Powers on the island. The Cyprus problem is at a critical juncture. Time may not be working in favour of reaching a settlement  but we must keep in mind that we cannot afford any more failed attempts. We should be particularly cautious but resolute. Revival of the talks requires thorough preparation and an honest assessment that the prospect of success is at least credible. This in turn requires confirmation that the Turkish political aims have now changed and that Turkey has reconciled itself to the fact that achieving a settlement is synonymous with the concept of a single  reunified State.  We have always hoped that Turkey’s accession course to the European Union would radically shift its mentality  a prospect that would mark the single biggest development in the Cyprus problem in decades. The fulfilment of Turkey’s obligations emanating from its accession course to the European Union will ipso jure rid the Cyprus problem of some of its most intractable components and facilitate a settlement. Simultaneously  the existence of the United Nations negotiating framework cannot serve as a pretext for postponing or refusing to fulfil these obligations.   For our part  we remain committed to a bizonal  bicommunal federal Cyprus in line with what we consider to be the pillars of the survival of this model of settlement — the high-level agreements  United Nations resolutions  international law and the acquis communautaire. We anticipate that these will safeguard the right of all Cypriots to preserve their fundamental interests while simultaneously taking into account their most basic concerns.  Aside from procedure  the time has come to go back to basics and realize that as long as the basic aspects of the problem are not truly tackled  progress will be difficult. Without dealing with the core components of the problem by putting an end to the military occupation  the massive violations of human rights and the plight of the refugees and by effectively addressing the question of settlers deliberately and illegally transported to the occupied part of the island  there can be no solution. At the same time  for progress to be realized on the ground all secessionist attempts on Cyprus must be terminated immediately  in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions  and a single vision based on the unification of the island must prevail.   Unfortunately  however  we have not been moving closer to these imperatives. Instead we have been witnessing for well over a year a tendency to entrench the faits accomplis on Cyprus  particularly through an outburst of illegal exploitation of Greek-Cypriot-owned property in its occupied part.  In establishing the new constitutional and institutional set-up we should avoid artificial structures that will require an abnormally long transitional period to be absorbed by the people and the institutions at a great socio-economic cost. We visualize that seeking a   05-51226 13  settlement will increasingly centre on and fall under the establishment of a functional  working democracy that does not require exceptionally taxing efforts for basic governance. We also visualize that with Cyprus’s membership of the European Union taking solid root  a settlement would encompass an integration of the currently occupied area to the characteristics of a European society and the standards of the acquis communautaire in full harmony with the rest of the island  and leading to a process of osmosis there.

"43",1804,"CZE",60,2005,"Let me begin bycongratulating Mr. Eliasson on his election to the21presidency. He is at the steering wheel of one of themost challenging sessions of the General Assembly inhistory — not only because it is the sixtiethanniversary of our Organization but mainly because ofour agenda and the gravity of problems awaitingresolution. While thanking his able and devotedpredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  I would like to wish thePresident every success in the coming months of hardand hopefully rewarding work.The European Union invested a huge effort in thepreparations for both the High-level Plenary Meetingand our current session  and the Czech Republic was anintegral and active part of this process. We heard thestatement of the European Union presidency a fewdays ago  and I have no intention of repeating it.Rather  let me present here several ideas and commentsof a more general nature.Millions of our fellow human beings in Africaand elsewhere are trapped in absolute poverty  withlittle or no access to education  medical and otherservices  and are deprived of a dignified existence. Intheir regions or in other parts of the world  fascinatingtechnical achievements and thriving economies enablelarge numbers of people to enjoy an unprecedentedlyhigh quality of life. Some may simply conclude thatthere are several distinct worlds on our planet. Butwhile the gaps may still be widening  let us be sure thatwe all live in only one increasingly interconnectedworld. There is no way to separate the rich from thepoor or to separate different ethnic groups. And theresponsibility for our future is equally indivisible.Moreover  we are repeatedly reminded thatdespite many advancements this world is still veryfragile and vulnerable. What is the common feature ofthe 9/11  Bali  Madrid  Beslan  Baghdad or Londonterrorist attacks; floods in China or in Central Europein 2002 and again in 2005; drought in parts of Africa;the Indian Ocean tsunami; and devastating hurricanesin the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico? They allexpose in their own way the vulnerability and fragilityof our civilization.Developed or developing  big or small  wecontinue to be vulnerable to the forces of nature as wellas the forces of evil. Fortunately  the worst ofsituations tends to awaken the best in human character:after any such disaster or terrorist attack we have seenraising waves of solidarity on a global scale  we haveseen renewed determination to fight the evil.It is our duty to tap this positive energy. Althoughno one will ever achieve 100 per cent security  muchcan be done by deepening our cooperation strengthening preventive measures  stepping up ourefforts in combating terrorism  enhancing themechanisms of development and humanitarian aid and in the long run  simply fulfilling the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. If reformed and mandated  theUnited Nations can play a central role in this process.Last year  many of us spoke of reform  andreform has indeed been one of the most frequently usedwords since then. There was much expectation in theair  much sincere effort to bring about change  as wellas many brilliant contributions to the debate: the reportof the High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges  andChange  the final report of the United NationsMillennium Project “Investing in Development” (theSachs report) and the Secretary-General’s report “InLarger Freedom”.After several rounds of discussion  we could saywe knew the diagnosis and could prescribe thenecessary medication  hoping that the summit wouldadd the most needed ingredients: the political will andthe means of delivery.So  was the summit a success or a failure? I tendto view its results  the outcome document  with soberoptimism. The challenge was enormous: to bringtogether development  security and human rights and tocraft a new delicate balance among the elements thatconstitute our global agenda. In my view  the summitmanaged — and this could be its major achievement —to set the tone  to set at least rough parameters of a newequation  the fine-tuning of the details being left forthe coming months. We have guidance for further talkson assistance and relief for developing countries. Wehave a prospect of increasing development aid including from the Czech Republic.At the summit  we agreed that the human rightsmachinery needed strengthening and redesigning.Indeed  it was probably the first time at such a majorevent that human rights was placed on an equal footingwith issues such as development and security. Butmany pieces of the puzzle have yet to be put in place.In shaping the future Human Rights Council  wehave to make sure that the progressive features andexperience of the Human Rights Commission are notlost  while avoiding its weaknesses and whatspecifically did not work  securing cooperation from22countries such as Belarus  Cuba  Myanmar  Zimbabweand others which repeatedly failed to respondadequately to the international community’s concernsabout human rights.Moreover  the summit reinforced ourcommitment to join forces in fighting terrorism  madethe groundbreaking decision to create thePeacebuilding Commission and endorsed the twinconcepts of responsibility to protect and humansecurity — all of which bring new hope to those facinglawlessness and oppression and which extend existingstandards of peace and security.But there are also areas where the summit failed:among others  disarmament and non-proliferation and most notably  the expansion of the Security Council.Our reform mission remains unfinished  but mustcontinue.If it is to face up to new challenges and tasks  theSecretariat must be strong and healthy. It has toundergo profound reform. The need for such a reformis further underlined by the recent findings of theVolcker report. I welcome the emphasis that thesummit put on United Nations management and its callfor efficiency  effectiveness and accountability.All in all  the summit took many steps in the rightdirection  shaping our vision and sharpening our tools.But there is another  hidden part of the story. Do all ofus really want the United Nations to grow stronger andmore efficient? Will a better  reformed — and trulyuniversal — United Nations be able to spare the worldall of its troubles? Will it be able to find solutions toevery conflict and bring lasting peace to everynotorious hot spot  including the Balkans  the MiddleEast  Iraq  Afghanistan and a number of places inAfrica? Will it be able to prevent millions of peoplefrom dying from hunger and diseases such asHIV/AIDS? Will it be strong enough to guarantee andpromote democracy and human rights?There is hope  and there is a chance — but theanswer depends on us. I can assure the Assembly thatthe Czech Republic is ready to carry out its part of theassignment  including in the Security Council if electedfor the period 2008-2009."

I wouldalso like to express my sincere thanks to the outgoingPresident for his dedicated work at the fifty-ninthsession. I endorse the statement of the European Union(EU) presidency.The debate at last week’s summit highlighted oneimportant point  namely  that peace  development security and human rights are inseparably linked. Onecannot address human rights and security without alsoaddressing development. All of those issues are at thevery heart of our policies.People are waiting for our solutions to thepressing problems of development. We must achievethe Millennium Development Goals. Of that we areacutely aware  both in Germany and in Europe. The EUplan to reach the 0.7 per cent official developmentassistance goal by 2015  and the Group of Eight (G-8)commitments made at Gleneagles  substantiallystrengthen the financial basis of our work.We are also willing to forge new paths by makinguse of innovative financing mechanisms.At the same time  frameworks establishing fairconditions for international trade are a prerequisite ifpoorer States are to share the benefits of globalization.The EU is leading the way with its “Everything ButArms” initiative  which grants the least developedcountries duty-free and quota-free market access. Inthat context  we must do all we can to make theMinisterial Conference of the World TradeOrganization  to be held in Hong Kong in December  asuccess. Only in that way can we bring the Doha roundnegotiations to a successful conclusion.We also know that excessive indebtedness curbsgrowth and development. The realignment of theHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) DebtInitiative after 1999 has considerably reduced theindebtedness of some 27 States. Germany has to dateforgiven €6.5 billion of debt and has earmarked afurther €4 billion for the continuation of the HIPCinitiative.Debt relief is  however  dependent on all creditorsspreading the burden fairly among themselves. We arealarmed by the fact that commercial and State creditorsoutside the Paris Club are doing less and less to live upto their responsibilities. I would like to seize thisopportunity to call for your support at the forthcomingannual meeting of the Bretton Woods institutions  forthe G-8 proposal and for an extensive cancellation ofdebts — including multilateral debts — for thecountries concerned.All of the foregoing emphasizes the greatimportance we attach to the global partnership for33development. That partnership is not  however  a one-way street. It also requires a commitment by partnerStates to put in place the conditions fordevelopment — that is  democracy  good governance respect for human rights and anti-corruption measures.Climate protection and development are alsoclosely intertwined. Of course  everyone must haveaccess to energy. Nevertheless  all States must do theirpart to prevent the ominous advance of climate change.In late November the parties to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change and theKyoto Protocol will meet in Montreal. There  we willhave the opportunity to adopt effective mechanisms toreduce emissions of greenhouse gases beyond 2012.That is precisely the policy pursued by the KyotoProtocol  and it is a policy we will adhere to.This year two natural catastrophes — the tsunamiin the Indian Ocean and Hurricane Katrina in theUnited States of America — have clearly demonstratedjust how vulnerable our societies are to naturaldisasters. We have all learned just how importantdisaster prevention is. As host to the ThirdInternational Conference on Early Warning  which willbe held in Bonn in March 2006  Germany hopes tocontribute to making better use of and improving earlywarning mechanisms and thereby limiting the scale ofthe damage caused by such disasters. Here I would liketo take this opportunity to reiterate our invitation to allMember States to join us in making the BonnConference a success.For years  United Nations engagement has beenhailed all over the world as a welcome sign ofprotection and assistance  of peace and reconstruction.Last Sunday saw the first free parliamentary electionsin Afghanistan under the new Constitution. TheGovernment of Afghanistan  with a full complement ofdemocratically legitimated institutions  is nowprepared to assume responsibility for the furtherreconstruction of the country. By going to the polls millions of women and men in Afghanistan haveproved that they have opted for democracy. Our thanksgo to the United Nations  which worked hard to makethose elections possible.In his latest report on Afghanistan (A/60/224) theSecretary-General announced that the United Nationswill remain committed to assisting the country after theelections. I heartily endorse that commitment; suchhelp is indispensable. For even if the Bonn process launched four years ago  has now been brought to asuccessful conclusion  the international communitywill still need to stand by Afghanistan. Germany  too will continue to do its utmost to support the country.The President returned to the Chair.Ten years after the conclusion of the DaytonAgreement  and six years after the end of the Kosovoconflict  the situation in the Western Balkans hasimproved tangibly. Nonetheless  major progress is stillrequired in the political  legal and economic fields. Thepeople of that region must genuinely come to termswith their past  and the parties to the conflict must bereconciled. In that connection  we call for fullcooperation with the International Criminal Tribunalfor the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.The Middle East still faces great challenges. Asits neighbours  we in Europe have a strategic interest inpeace and stability in the region. We are convinced thatonly through reform  the strengthening of democracyand the rule of law can lasting stability be guaranteed.The free and fair parliamentary elections in Palestineand Lebanon are encouraging signs of change.The Middle East peace process has also gainednew momentum over past months. We emphaticallywelcome the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Stripand the northern part of the West Bank. Now it is vitalthat Israelis  Palestinians and the internationalcommunity do all they can to lay the foundations forpolitical and economic stability in the Gaza Strip.Efforts should be focused on a two-State solution basedon the road map. The objective remains a viablePalestinian State  living side by side with Israel withinsecure and recognized borders.The international community is united in itsdetermination to help Iraq establish democracy and therule of law. We want all Iraqis to be able to live freefrom fear and material hardship. The forces of terrorand violence must not and shall not be permitted to winthe upper hand. The Middle East needs a stable prosperous Iraq.Here  too  the United Nations is making itscontribution towards the process of political transitionand reconstruction. That is why we have providedconsiderable financial assistance for the protectionforce whose presence allows the United Nations towork in Iraq. It is also why Germany has  at Iraq’srequest  advised that country on constitutional issues.34The Iranian nuclear programme continues to be amajor cause of concern. Past violations of internationalobligations  a lack of transparency in its actions  andinsufficient cooperation with subsequent investigationshave destroyed any confidence that the programme isfor exclusively peaceful purposes. With support fromthe EU High Representative  Germany  France and theUnited Kingdom have worked with Iran on finding away to restore confidence. Those efforts have receivedbroad support from the international community.Tehran’s continued disregard of International AtomicEnergy Agency decisions  however  is furtherweakening that confidence and the gains made to dateare being put at risk for no good reason. We shouldemphasize that our concerns do not relate to Iran’sright to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.This has never been and will not be put inquestion. Our concerns do not relate to Iran’s right touse nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. That hasnever been and will not be called into question.We remain prepared to work on solutions whichinclude objective guarantees that the Iranian nuclearprogramme can serve only peaceful ends. I appeal toIran to refrain from taking unilateral measures and toreturn to the negotiating table.There is general agreement that the proliferationof weapons of mass destruction is now more than evera life-threatening risk to us all. It is thus all the moreregrettable that no consensus could be reached on theinclusion in the outcome document of a chapter onnon-proliferation and disarmament. If we want toprevent the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  in particular of nuclear weapons  all Statesmust fulfil their obligations. At the same time  newmomentum must be brought to the process of nucleardisarmament.In that context  I welcome the latest progress madeby the six-party talks towards resolving the nuclearcrisis on the Korean peninsula. It is a vital first step.Africa is in many ways a touchstone for and anexample of an effective multilateral system. The closecooperation of the United Nations with the AfricanUnion  as well as with the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS)  has had a beneficialimpact in Sierra Leone  Liberia  Côte d’Ivoire and recently  in Burundi. The United Nations is alsoplaying an equally important role in efforts to stabilizethe Great Lakes region.Following the death of John Garang  the peaceprocess in the Sudan requires an even greatercommitment by all parties to implement the historicNairobi peace agreement. The United Nations Missionin the Sudan (UNMIS)  to which Germany hascontributed personnel  is making a major contribution.However  we must not neglect other crisis areas  inparticular Darfur. The African Union mission in Darfurhas helped to stabilize the security situation in the areawhere it is stationed.The variety of problems facing us — poverty  socialpolarization  global population growth  inadequate watersupplies and global climate change  to name only themost pressing — serves to highlight the need forconcerted action. We must prepare the United Nationsfor the challenges of the twenty-first century.Over the past 12 months  reform of the UnitedNations has been intensively debated. Member States the High-level Panel and the Secretary-General himselfhave provided valuable input. Some of their proposalsare contained in the outcome document adopted at lastweek’s world summit.However  only when we have managed toimplement those proposals will we be able to speak oftrue achievement. To be a success  the process requiresthe active participation of all Member States.The tasks that the summit has set the GeneralAssembly must be tackled with speed and focus. Atthis session  the General Assembly must make abreakthrough towards the adoption of thecomprehensive convention on international terrorism.It must also work on the creation of a PeacebuildingCommission.Sustainable peace requires more than merelyrestoring security. The post-conflict peacebuildingphase is particularly crucial. The sooner reconstructioncan begin  and the better coordinated the peacemakingand post-conflict recovery efforts are  the better thechances of lasting stabilization. The summit took avital step in that direction by deciding to establish thePeacebuilding Commission by the end of the year.Secretary-General Kofi Annan  in his reportentitled “In larger freedom”  states that:“No security agenda and no drive fordevelopment will be successful unless they arebased on … respect for human dignity”.(A/59/2005  para. 128)35If we wish to lend greater weight to theprotection and promotion of human rights  we mustalso strengthen the relevant United Nations bodies andmechanisms.Germany therefore welcomes the decision takenby the summit to create a Human Rights Council whichwill replace the Commission on Human Rights. TheGeneral Assembly must now move fast to define themandate and structures of the Human Rights Council.It must ensure that the new body enjoys greaterlegitimacy than its predecessor and that its workingmethods are more effective  especially when it comesto responding to acute crises.Allow me a last word. A glance at the troublespots around the world makes it clear that we  theinternational community  face far more conflicts in theSouth than we do in the North. Key decisions onsettling those conflicts are taken in the SecurityCouncil which  under the Charter of the UnitedNations  has primary responsibility for the maintenanceof peace. Its composition  however  still reflects theworld of 1945 and not that of the twenty-first century.Adjusting and expanding the membership of theSecurity Council by adding both permanent and non-permanent members thus remains essential. Any reformof the United Nations that does not include reform of theSecurity Council is not worthy of the name.The Security Council is in danger of losing itsauthority and legitimacy as long as entire continentsand major contributors are not adequately represented.Germany and its partners Brazil  India and Japantherefore have submitted a proposal on reform of theCouncil. It is the only proposal that includes acomprehensive reform of the Security Council and itsworking methods. We are convinced that it is the onlyproposal capable of obtaining the necessary two-thirdsmajority in the General Assembly.Reform of the Security Council is anindispensable part of the overhaul of the UnitedNations. In last week’s summit document  we allpledged to swiftly advance those reforms. We do notneed only progress; we need results. The time is ripefor radical reform. Let us use this session of theGeneral Assembly to finally resolve this issue  which isso vital to the future of the United Nations."
"45",1925,"DMA",60,2005,"Mr. President  pleaseallow me  on behalf of the Government of theCommonwealth of Dominica  to extend ourcongratulations to you on your assumption of thepresidency at the sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly. My delegation is confident that  with yourexperience and diplomatic skills  you will preside overthe Assembly with the effectiveness and the dedicationrequired to take us through the agenda of the sixtiethsession. We extend to your predecessor  Mr. Jean Pingof Gabon  our sincere appreciation for his stewardshipof the fifty-ninth session and for his tireless efforts toguide the preparation of the outcome document. Ourwarm tribute is also due to the Secretary-General forhis unqualified dedication to this institution.Allow me at the outset to convey our deepestsympathies and condolences to the Government and thepeople of the United States of America in the wake ofthe deaths and widespread destruction caused byHurricane Katrina. We remain concerned about thepotential devastation that Hurricane Rita is likely tounleash in coming days.One week ago  world leaders gathered here at thehistoric High-level Plenary Meeting and demonstratedtheir collective political will to overcome the manychallenges facing the world. They charted a cleardirection for a future of peace and prosperity for allhumankind. They reaffirmed their commitment toachieving the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs)  underscored the continuing relevance of theUnited Nations and its indispensable role in thecollective management of the many problems faced bythe global community  and provided clearrecommendations for the reform of the Organization.The outcome document  while falling short of ourexpectations  presents a platform for multilateralsolutions to the broad range of global problems relatedto development  peace and security  human rights  therule of law and the reinvigoration of the UnitedNations. The Commonwealth of Dominica iscommitted to the Millennium Development Goals andembraces the renewed pledge to save humanity fromthe scourge of war  disease  famine and poverty. Wewill work with all Member States to ensure a futurebased on hope and prosperity instead of one of despairfor the poor and the marginalized of this world. Wenow have before us the monumental task of ensuringimplementation and tangible outcomes.Fulfilling that task  which our esteemed leadershave accorded to us  requires the determined will of allMember States. It will also require a commitment tothe collective will and a retreat from preoccupationwith self-interest and narrow national agendas. Ifnothing else  the sixtieth session should go down inhistory as the session at which we  the Member States renewed our commitment to the ideal that inspired the31visionary founders: building a peaceful and prosperousworld in which all peoples live together in harmony free from want and fear.Dominica  a small island developing State welcomes the particular attention given in the outcomedocument to the special needs and vulnerabilities ofsmall island developing States. It is a source of greatencouragement to us that the Member States of theUnited Nations have demonstrated an appreciation ofthe challenges that confront all small island developingStates.The Mauritius Strategy for the FurtherImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Actionis a realistic and attainable blueprint that underscoresthe pivotal areas for interventions to build the capacityof small island developing States to confront theirvarious sustainable development challenges. Weappreciate the support of our friends and developmentpartners and appeal for their continuing commitment tothe proper and effective implementation of theMauritius Strategy.Progress in the development arena will requirestrong political will for the implementation of thecommitments we have undertaken and which wereaffirmed together in the outcome document of theHigh-level Plenary Meeting. These concern primarilythe implementation of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals and the revitalization of the internationalpartnership for development  with the attendantmobilization of financial resources  as well as thefulfilment of the commitment made by manydeveloped countries to reach the target of 0.7 per centof their gross national product for official developmentassistance by 2015. Dominica takes this opportunity toexpress its appreciation to those countries that affirmedtheir intention to fulfil their obligations in that regard.My delegation feels strongly that the consensuswe reached in the High-level Plenary Meetingrepresents a good foundation for a greater consensustowards achieving the development priorities of thedeveloping countries. The United Nations must play apivotal role in ensuring that the issues of trade  debtrelief  investment and industrial modernization receivethe highest priority if the global objective is to raise thestandard of living of the people of the developingcountries.We congratulate the Group of Eight for thecommitment adopted at the Gleneagles Summit  givingmuch-needed debt relief to 18 heavily indebted poorcountries. However  a similar initiative is now requiredfor small island developing States and middle incomedeveloping countries that are being strangled by heavydebt burdens and the simultaneous erosion of theirpreferential trading arrangements.South-South cooperation has been growing overthe last two decades  and through that mechanismmany avenues have opened for enhanced traderelations and cooperation in the transfer of know-howand technology. Dominica welcomes the establishmentof the South Fund for Development and HumanitarianAssistance and the generous initial pledges of theGovernments of Qatar  India and China to this Fund.Equally deserving of commendation is Venezuela’sinitiative in the Caribbean  called Petrocaribe  whichwill help Caribbean countries to respond to thechallenges posed by the high price of oil.Aid without trade cannot be a viable propositionfor small island States like Dominica. We are fullycognizant that only trade can be the engine of growthand development. Dominica and other banana-producing States in the Caribbean have had difficultiesresponding to the stance of multinational corporationsfrom the United States and allied Latin Americancountries that have challenged the preferential accessfor our bananas in the European Union. We hope thatreason will prevail  as we count on a fair resolution ofthe present banana trade impasse in Europe. Only apositive outcome will avert a future of persistentpoverty for banana farmers and workers in theCaribbean.Let me reiterate that small  vulnerable islandStates like Dominica need time to adjust to thetransition to a fully liberalized global trading regime.Dominica has made admirable progress towardsrealization of the MDGs  but such gains could simplyvanish like a thief in the night if we lose thepreferential access to the European market for ourbananas in 2006. For this reason we appeal to theinternational community to demonstrate the necessarypolitical will to ensure that the Doha DevelopmentRound takes these concerns into account in the questfor a fair and equitable trading system for the benefitof all our people.The frequency of devastating storms in Asia  theCaribbean and the southern United States and longperiods of drought in Africa require a more coordinated32and organized international response. The UnitedNations needs to significantly enhance its capacity torespond in a timely manner to disasters in the morevulnerable developing countries. Last year manyCaribbean countries were battered by hurricanes  andthe Eastern Caribbean nation of Grenada was in theunfortunate situation of facing the onslaught of twomajor hurricanes in one calendar year. Grenada stillneeds additional assistance from the internationalcommunity  and we appeal to all Member States to lendsuch assistance.Dominica has had its share of hurricanedevastation. Late last year we experienced devastationfrom a series of earthquakes which inflicted significantdamage on our fragile infrastructure. We continue to bevigilant and have put in place a national disasterstrategy to mitigate the adverse effects of suchdisasters on our population. My delegation once againreiterates the appeal made last year in this Hall byPrime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit for the creation of aglobal insurance fund to assist countries devastated bynatural disasters. We call on the internationalcommunity to fully implement the Hyogo Frameworkfor Action 2005-2015  adopted at this year’s WorldConference on Disaster Reduction.Climate change is wreaking havoc on smallisland developing States. It is time for all MemberStates to accept that climate change and globalwarming are real and that they are caused by humanactivity. All Member States must implement theprovisions of the Kyoto Protocol.My delegation is concerned about the continuinginstability in Haiti. We support the role of the UnitedNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  but weappreciate that its limited size and resources areinadequate to respond to the complicated politicalsituation in which Haiti finds itself. CaribbeanCommunity and Common Market (CARICOM) Stateshave already committed technical assistance for theelections and are cognizant that elections alone will notbring stability to Haiti. Stability will require theaccelerated disbursement of pledged financialresources  more rapid implementation of social andeconomic project activities  and peacebuildinginitiatives.Terrorism remains a great threat to peace andsecurity at the national  regional and internationallevels. Dominica condemns all acts  methods andpractices of terrorism. The recent attacks in Londonand in Egypt underscore the danger of terrorism  whichtranscends national boundaries and does notdistinguish between peoples  cultures or religions.Dominica is making a great effort to comply with theobligations of the various counter-terrorismconventions and pledges its support for the conclusionof the comprehensive convention on internationalterrorism.My delegation regrets the failure of the outcomedocument to address non-proliferation anddisarmament in the area of weapons of massdestruction. Relative stability in today’s world shouldnot make us complacent and lead us to compromise onthe need for total disarmament. Our continuing lack ofaction on this issue has not served to enhance globalsecurity with respect to the threat posed by theseweapons.Small arms and light weapons pose a greatchallenge to the maintenance of peace and security inthe Caribbean region. Narcotics trafficking has broughtwith it increased circulation of small arms and lightweapons  which has led to a sharp increase in crimeand fatal injuries. Dominica therefore welcomes theagreement on an international instrument that wouldenable States to identify and trace illicit small arms andlight weapons in a timely and reliable manner. What isstill needed  however  is a legally binding internationalinstrument that will regulate  control and monitor theillicit trade in small arms  including their transfer tonon-State actors.Dominica is appreciative of the recognitionaccorded to indigenous people in the outcomedocument. As part of our commitment to the SecondInternational Decade of the World’s Indigenous People my delegation will work with other Member Statestowards the submission to the General Assembly of adraft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples.The future of the United Nations depends on fullimplementation of an institutional reform agenda thataddresses revitalization of the General Assembly reform of the Security Council and improvedgovernance in the Secretariat. General Assemblyrevitalization must result in the strengthening of theAssembly’s vital role as the chief deliberative policymaking and implementation-monitoring body ofthe United Nations. The Secretariat needs to urgentlyaddress eroding public confidence through timely33implementation of the proposals for improvement in itsmanagement and oversight. Reform of the SecurityCouncil must be pursued to enhance the Council’saccountability  transparency and efficiency. Suchreform must  at a minimum  ensure that the Council’smembership is more representative and remedy thecontinuing imbalance in the representation of Africa inthe permanent membership.We welcome the initiative to establish aDemocracy Fund. Consistent with our support for thepromotion of fundamental human freedoms and values we support the establishment of a Human RightsCouncil. We also support the proposed PeacebuildingCommission as an advisory body.Let me conclude by saying that we have a loadedagenda for the next decade  and that there arenumerous challenges ahead. We wish to emphasize thatthat agenda can be realized only through multilateralaction. As we look ahead to 2015  we have thehonourable duty to make the United Nations truly servethe people of this global village. We have theobligation to ensure that we the peoples of the UnitedNations can truly live our lives in larger freedom."
"46",1969,"DNK",60,2005,"The conclusion of thesummit last week marks the beginning of another busyyear for the General Assembly and the Member Statesof the United Nations. The summit gave us anambitious new agenda and in the spirit ofmultilateralism we must do our utmost to meet thegoals it set out. Denmark intends to pull up its sleevesand contribute to that undertaking and I encourageothers to do the same.In his impressive report “In larger freedom”(A/59/2005)  issued in March  the Secretary-General11gave us the best possible basis for the necessary andprofound changes the Organization must undergo. Thespirit of the new interrelated reform agenda is capturedin the report’s observation that “… we will not enjoydevelopment without security  we will not enjoysecurity without development  and we will not enjoyeither without respect for human rights” (A/59/2005 para. 17). With those words the Secretary-Generalidentified the three pillars of the United Nations in thetwenty-first century: security  development and humanrights.The custodian of international peace and securityis the Security Council. In October last year  memberselected Denmark as a non-permanent member of theSecurity Council. We have — to the best of ourabilities — sought to translate the trust bestowed uponus into action: Denmark holds the Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee; we work for improvements inUnited Nations peacekeeping by pursuing a holisticapproach to the concept of peacebuilding; we advocatebetter protection for women and children; and wesupport a stronger emphasis on the rule of law and theneed to end impunity.The Security Council must clearly demonstrate itswill to enforce the decisions taken by it. If not  theCouncil loses credibility  and the internationalcommunity loses its only forceful multilateralinstrument.Targeted sanctions are an important instrumentfor achieving compliance with decisions of theSecurity Council and for compliance with internationallaw in general. We must continue an intensive dialogueon how best to implement sanctions and how to followthem up to ensure the desired outcome. The approachmust always include both carrot and stick — incentiveand punishment.The United Nations plays a central role in effortsto fight terrorism and we support the Secretary-General’s outline for a comprehensive United Nationscounter-terrorism strategy that will engage the wholeUnited Nations system in the fight against terrorism.We will take an active part in its further developmentand implementation. We also welcome the newresolution on terrorism adopted by the SecurityCouncil (Security Council resolution 1624 (2005)).As Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Denmark regards itself as having a specialresponsibility in that field. We have given priority toenhanced cooperation between the relevant SecurityCouncil subsidiary organs dealing with terrorism  andwe will continue to do so. We have also engaged indialogue with parts of the United Nations family notpreviously involved in the fight against terrorism. Theaim of that dialogue is to identify their role in helpingStates that would like to engage more actively in thefight against terrorism  but which lack the capacity todo so. We will continue our efforts to strengthen thesynergies between relevant United Nations actors tofurther strengthen the counter-terrorism capability ofthe United Nations.Our efforts to fight international terrorism mustbe carried out with full respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms. It is imperative to strike theright balance between  on the one hand  preventive andswift action against terrorists and  on the other adequate safeguards for the individual  and not leastfor those who have been unjustly listed.The summit has sent an important politicalmessage about the dedication of Member States to fightterrorism  even if it was not as strong as we hadwished. We must now make every effort  at the presentsession of the General Assembly  to reach agreementon a comprehensive convention on internationalterrorism. Any further stalling on that important issuewill send the wrong message.The single most frightening scenario today is thatof weapons of mass destruction in the hands of non-State actors. Such possession constitutes a danger tocivilizations all over the world. Nobody can claim tobe safe today. Everybody must acknowledge the dangerand refrain from activities that increase the threat. Weneed a concerted effort in the field of non-proliferationand disarmament. The failure of the non-proliferationtreaty review conference  held this spring  to producean agreement and the lack of new commitments at thesummit must not lead to resignation  but rather mustspur us to redouble our efforts.At the same  time concerted action is needed toend illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons which kill 500 000 people every year. Arms transfersmust be transparent. Denmark strongly supports theadoption of an international arms trade treaty. Such atreaty must be legally binding  include all weapons andbe United Nations-based.Denmark favours a holistic approach topeacebuilding. We believe the United Nations is well12placed to coordinate international efforts to assistcountries emerging from conflict. Therefore  we haveactively supported the establishment of thePeacebuilding Commission. This new body will addvalue to the work done by various actors including thefunds and programmes of the United Nations. I urgeMember States to ensure that the Commission will beoperational by the end of the year  as requested by thesummit.It is a fact that conflicts in Africa continue toloom large on the Security Council’s agenda. Theslogan “African solutions to African problems” mustnot lead to indifference from donors. We must increaseour assistance to regional capacity-building and  at thesame time  be prepared to provide the necessary humanand financial resources for conflict prevention andpeacebuilding efforts. To that end  Denmark issponsoring a major capacity-building programme inAfrica in close cooperation with the African Union andthe Economic Community of West African States.The summit confirmed our dedication to fulfil theMillennium Development Goals through considerabledonor commitments  as well as the need to payparticular attention to countries in Africa that arelagging far behind. Denmark will remain well abovethe 0.7 aid target and urges all donor countries toimplement the goals decided by the summit. Theresponsibility  however  does not rest with donorcountries alone. In order to ensure sustainabledevelopment the world’s poor countries must prioritizehuman development and respect for human rights tackle national inequalities and curb corruption.In a closely interrelated and interdependentworld  our collective security and prosperity dependcritically on the success of our fight against poverty.We must continue to look for new ways to enforceinternational law and protect those in need. Promotingthe rule of law must be one of the main objectiveswhen devising peacebuilding strategies in Africa andwhen addressing democratic deficits elsewhere.The President returned to the Chair.Indeed  prosperity and security will occur only ifand when we decide to respect and promote humanrights. It is our obligation to address and to act onhuman rights violations wherever they occur  and wemust do so in a spirit of cooperation andunderstanding. It is our common duty to measure everyMember State’s actual performance against theuniversal standards of human rights  including whenthat means naming and even shaming. Otherwise  werisk undermining important norms of human decencyand behaviour. All Governments must remember thatthey are in office for the people and not for themselves.For those reasons  Denmark strongly supports theestablishment of the Human Rights Council as apermanent  principal organ of the United Nations  aswell as the overall strengthening of the entire UnitedNations human rights machinery  including the Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights. Sixty years after the creation of this Organization we should give human rights the necessary attention andpriority in order to meet the expectations of the people whom we are meant to serve.The grave crimes against humanity committed inDarfur serve as a reminder to the internationalcommunity. Impunity is unacceptable. Some argue thatwe face a dilemma every time a country emerges fromconflict. They argue that the pursuit of justice clasheswith the pursuit of peace. However  peace and justiceare not contradictory but  in fact  complementary. Theprecedent created by the referral of the Darfur situationto the International Criminal Court is promising. It is amajor step forward in the fight against impunity andbodes well for the pursuit of international justice.Lastly  let me briefly address the call by theSecretary-General and Member States  includingDenmark  for management reform. The Secretary-General must be given the necessary discretionarypowers  accompanied by accountability andindependent oversight. We need to modernize the waywe work so as to enable the Organization to meet itsshare of the priorities set out at the summit.The coming months will be crucial. The outcomeof the summit must be implemented. We will be facedwith many difficult but important tasks. They will haveto be solved in a true spirit of internationalcooperation. We must strengthen this great institution.It has a vital role to play in the world of today.Denmark will spare no effort in doing its share."
"47",2014,"DOM",60,2005,"Permit me to join others inexpressing  on behalf of our President  Mr. LeonelFernández Reyna  our heartfelt congratulations toAmbassador Jan Eliasson of Sweden on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at this historicsixtieth session. The Dominican Republic is confidentthat he will lead it in an effective and fruitful manner. Ialso express my gratitude to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his most valuable contributions tothe strengthening of the United Nations as aninstitution. In addition  I wish to congratulate HisExcellency Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon and toacknowledge his notable work in leading the mostrecent session.This sixtieth session of the General Assemblyshould go down in history as one of the mostmomentous United Nations sessions. Proof of that liesin two areas of major significance on its agenda: first accountability with regard to the degree ofachievement of the Millennium Development Goalsand renewal of the commitments made to achievethem; and secondly  setting out the course for reform ofthe Organization to adapt it so that it can addresscurrent challenging problems and guarantee theeffectiveness of its actions in order to ensure thedevelopment  freedom and peace of all the world’speoples.For nations such as the one I represent  theambitious agenda aimed at achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 has become thekey governmental programme.What could be more important to smallunderdeveloped nations with scarce natural resourcesthan leading their people out of the socio-economicabyss caused by poverty  poor health and the lack ofeducation and productive employment? No politicalaction is more urgent — at least not in the DominicanRepublic. Eliminating poverty in the world is amonumental task requiring unstinting politicalcommitment and the collective participation of allsocieties  as well as unlimited economic support fromthe developed nations.The heartbreaking realities of the present aremorally unacceptable in a world with humankind at itscentre; they underline the flawed nature of the zero-sum policies practised in the past  when the greatPowers dedicated themselves to amassing wealth byexploiting the riches of poorer  weaker nations.Widespread poverty is not good for poor nations and even less so for rich nations. As all know  povertyleads to despair  violence and chaos. That  in turn produces unbearable social and political tensions andthe outbreak of conflicts  leading to failed States.When a State fails  the conflict raging within spillsover into regional conflicts or prompts endless unstoppable waves of migrants. In today’s world  afailed State eventually becomes an issue before theUnited Nations  requiring attention and solutions.5When one has examined how that chain of eventsworks  it becomes clear that achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals is crucial.Allow me to underline the following. It isalarming that in 2015  the year in which theMillennium Development Goals are to be achieved  theproduction of oil — the fuel that enabled the world toachieve spectacular growth over the past 100 years —is projected to begin to decline dangerously. To foreseethe future  one has only to take a good look at thepresent. All the world’s Governments face difficultiescaused by high oil prices  and we are all aware that thistime  unlike the oil shock of the 1970s  the presentreduction in the flow of oil could become permanent. Iemphasize this because  owing to that situation  ournations risk facing endless difficulties on all fronts.It is disturbing that this should happen preciselywhen we are making enormous efforts to overcome theobstacles preventing us from creating a dignified  freeand safe society for our peoples. The predicted globalcrisis could bring an ongoing reduction in oilproduction  immediately causing higher oil prices. Thecatastrophic effects that would produce cannot beignored today. We have known for a long time that oilwould not last forever. Now is the time for the UnitedNations to launch an initiative  much broader in scopethan the Millennium Development Goals  to chart acourse guiding Member States to a civilization notdependent on oil.My country  the Dominican Republic  shares thesmall Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti. It hasto be said that  historically  the problems on one side ofthe border have tended to become problems for theother side. Haiti  a country with a 200-year history ofindependence  is a fractured nation today. Amidinsurmountable economic difficulties and all types ofsocial shortfalls  its political conflicts weakened itsinstitutions  and the State collapsed.Today’s transitional regime  without enoughresources to function properly  is  with the support ofthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti striving greatly to rebuild what was destroyed  and theinternational community has put great hope in restoringlegitimate political authority through the holding ofelections.In the General Assembly and elsewhere  manyhave said that they believe that the electoral process inHaiti should not have been given top priority; rather top priority should have gone to humanitarianassistance and job creation by means of a massiveprogramme for building infrastructure such as roads water supply systems  schools  hospitals and electricgenerators. However  past experience in the process ofrebuilding failed States points to the priority need tolegitimize new political leadership through elections even though we know that in such cases  the idealframework for holding elections cannot be achieved.That is why  on behalf of my country’s President Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna  I propose that the UnitedNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  with the supportof the Transitional Government of Haiti and theinternational community  should carry out — as theyhave been doing — a broad national dialogue to reachgeneral agreement between the political forces and theorganized sectors of Haitian civil society.Such an agreement would ensure nationalreconciliation and prepare the way for a nationalreconstruction plan that has the support of all Haitianleadership. All Haitian civil society and politicalleadership have important roles to play in theircountry’s institutional reconstruction  and all mustfulfil those responsibilities. We cannot ignore the factthat in recent years  the Haitian people have beenliving in fear  insecurity  poverty and despair. Forrecovery to take place  the people need to haveconfidence in the process of peace  reconciliation andthe rebuilding of State institutions.In addition  President Fernandez proposes that theUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti(MINUSTAH) invite distinguished world leaders to bepresent during the elections in Haiti  in order to givemore credibility to the electoral process.Among these statesmen  the Dominican Republictakes the liberty of suggesting Presidents Fox ofMexico and Lula da Silva of Brazil  the formerPresidents of the United States of America  Mr. Carterand Mr. Clinton  and the legendary former President ofSouth Africa  Nelson Mandela.Elections are the first important political step tohelp Haiti back on its feet. We are not under theillusion that elections alone will guarantee security ensure the reign of democracy in the immediate futureor produce an overnight improvement in the livingconditions of Haitians.6Our own experience has taught us that the road todemocracy will be a long one  as it has been for thenations that today function within the framework ofdemocratic institutions. And the road towardsdevelopment will be even longer but more secure  iftensions are reduced  a climate of cooperation isfostered and if donor nations and institutions faithfullyfulfil their generous promises of financial support forHaiti in a timely manner.On the subject of peace  security and dialogue we want to comment on two items that are very high onthe international political agenda. First  the progressmade in the peace process between Israel and thePalestinian National Authority.Secondly  the recent natural disasters in Asia andnow in the United States of America are forcing us tothink about the vulnerability of nations to thepotentially dangerous  manmade changes in the balanceof nature when faced with these types of events. Wesincerely regret the loss of life due to HurricaneKatrina.In conclusion  I would like to say that we mustnot lose time. Let us act today  as if this were our lastopportunity to reach a consensus and formulate actionto turn sustainable development into a collectiveachievement in order to ensure world security andprogress together on the road to peace."
"48",2061,"DZA",60,2005,"Atthis crucial moment  when it is debating questions vitalto the United Nations and all humanity  the GeneralAssembly has unanimously decided to elect you  Mr.President  to preside over the deliberations of itssixtieth session. I therefore congratulate you verywarmly and offer you my best wishes for success. Ialso congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  andthank the Secretary-General for his efforts for peace development and agreement among nations.Our world has been radically transformed sincethe end of the cold war — that sombre period that stillhas continuing effects. New threats have appeared while other  older ones remain. New kinds ofchallenges loom  even as the international communityis falling behind in finding appropriate responses toexisting challenges  which are getting worse. Newconflicts are erupting violently today  while theinternational community still struggles with theflashpoints that appeared following the Second WorldWar  as well as those that arose out of the ensuingprocess of decolonization.Humanitarian disasters  whether man-made ornatural  and the problems of refugees  famine  theAIDS pandemic and malaria  exacerbated by persistentunderdevelopment have contributed more than ever tostretch beyond strictly military issues our definition ofcollective security  which our Organization  since itsbirth  has been asked to promote. The mission toprotect remains today an unattainable goal.A vital threat seen daily throughout the world isthe growing threat of international terrorism  whichrespects no borders and violates the most fundamentalhuman rights. It is not enough to vigorously denouncethe killing of innocent victims. To combat terrorism we must oppose it with relentless determination. In thatcontext  there is no alternative to resolute internationalcooperation that recognizes  above all  that an effectiveresponse to transnational terrorism is necessarily acollective effort.Algeria believes it urgent to implement existingagreements on the fight against terrorism and toconclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism thatcan overcome the difficulties in reaching an agreeddefinition of terrorism while not providing pretexts forthe oppression of peoples seeking to realize theirlegitimate rights. Active cooperation has been longawaited  but it is not sufficient.Bilateral  regional and multilateral cooperationmust be expanded and improved as we strengtheninternational legal instruments  such as theInternational Convention for the Suppression of Actsof Nuclear Terrorism  adopted last April.At the same time  given the justifiable revulsionterrorism provokes  we must guard against attributingsuch acts to any religion or civilization. On thecontrary  we must emphasize that the aspiration topeace and the search for agreement and exchange13among peoples are values common to the variouscivilizations we represent. That leads us to express ourcomplete rejection of terrorism and spurs our collectivereaction against it.We cannot hide our concern at growingintolerance and the echoes we sometimes hear ofpseudo-theories and false analyses that show ever lessrestraint in directly blaming Islam  which  for theoverwhelming majority of a billion believers  is areligion that calls for fraternity  solidarity andtolerance. To blame Islam - as some small butinfluential groups do - is to forget that beforeterrorism was recognized as an internationalphenomenon  it also struck  in particular  at Muslimswho had rejected the perpetrators and denied theirclaims that they represented all Muslims.I strongly reaffirm that those criminals have placedthemselves outside Islam and have no claim to it. I saythis on behalf of a country that has suffered a decade ofterrorism and which has found precisely in its religionthe endurance and the will to triumph over barbarism staunch its wounds  renew its hope and take the path ofreconciliation and brotherhood  which are at the veryheart of the community of people and its leaders  as weapproach the national referendum of 29 September.Although the situation today confirms some ofour earlier doubts and concerns  our only concern nowis to see the people of Iraq — the heirs to an ancientcivilization that is admired by the whole world —return to peace and stability through the recovery of itsfull and complete sovereignty over a territory whoseintegrity is best preserved by exorcising the divisivedemons generated by the present circumstances.The Arab world is today the site of promisingdevelopments for the development of democracy andeconomic prosperity for its people. It would be wrongto see in these developments merely a response toexternal pressure. First and foremost  it comes frompeoples wishing to participate  finally and actively  intheir future  and who are eager to make their specificcontribution to the conduct of affairs in a world wherenothing that happens should be alien to them.This desire for reform brought the Arab heads ofState together in Algiers  last March for a summitmeeting  over which we were honoured to preside.Reaffirming that desire  the leaders made firmcommitments and we have proceeded to implementthem.As diverse as the Arab countries may be in theirpolitical  economic and social realities  we still havethe same aspiration  which is bearing us towards afuture of peace and progress to be shared by all ifpossible. In other words  we are fully aware that nopeace and no sustainable economic momentum can bebuilt in the Middle East unless the Palestinian peoplerecover their full and complete sovereignty in theoccupied territories  including Al-Quds Al-Sharif capital of their independent State.It is a positive thing that the risks of nuclearproliferation have received heightened internationalattention in the last few years. The seventh Conferenceto review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty heldlast May should have provided us with a specialoccasion to develop and adopt appropriate measures todeal with the problem on a consensual basis. However we must note that our expectation was not met particularly with respect to the 13 measures on nucleardisarmament agreed to at the preceding Conference.Algeria  which has adopted and supported theAdditional Protocol on the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA) safeguards regime  also fullysupports total and complete disarmament  as well asthe total elimination of weapons of mass destruction.But we cannot conceal our concern that an exception tothe treaty that has been tolerated  even allowed  in aregion as riven by conflict as the Middle East onlyfurther underscores the discriminatory approach thatprevails with respect to non-proliferation.The African landscape has been profoundlytransformed since the formation of the African Unionand the launching of the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD). So it is with new energy thatAfrica  having established its Peace and SecurityCouncil  has decided to tackle the conflicts that afflictit and to take up the resolute promotion of their finalsettlement. Anyone who looks at Africa objectivelycannot ignore the endemic diseases  all of the visibleand latent crises  the natural and man-made disasters the famine and illiteracy. But today’s Africa  we mustnote  has never had so many democratically electedregimes and so many economies undergoing promisingreforms. Much still needs to be done  and the Africancountries are the first to recognize that.Out of a sense of solidarity and also out of self-interest  developed countries should accompany Africain its determination to make a radical change in itscircumstances so as to allow the African continent to14become part of the world economy  gain prosperity andmake its contribution to the prosperity of the world ingeneral. This cannot be done unless we take specificactions that have been amply identified by NEPAD  bythe Commission for Africa established by Tony Blairand by the report of the Secretary-General of ourOrganization.As you know  the main points are to erase thedebt and raise official development assistance (ODA)from the current $25 billion to $50 billion and then to$75 billion between now and 2010  to establish aninternational finance facility and to raise ODA from thedeveloped countries to 0.7 per cent of their grossdomestic product by 2015.It is also in Africa  near Algeria  that we still seeone of the last remaining uncompleted processes ofdecolonization. I am referring to the conflict in theWestern Sahara  where Morocco and the PolisarioFront are adversaries. The United Nations hasidentified this territory as being non-autonomous  andit is a situation that is actionable under the Declarationon the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countriesand Peoples. There is a peace plan that has beenapproved unanimously by the Security Council  callingfor a framework and modalities for a final settlementthrough a free consultation of the Saharawi peopleregarding their destiny.My country believes that the Baker Plan is theonly framework able to lead to a settlement of theconflict  which pits Moroccans against the Polisario.Algeria fully supports the efforts of the United Nations tothis end. We are pleased in this respect to see Mr. Petervan Walsum appointed as Personal Envoy of theSecretary-General and we assure him of our support in hismission  just as we do the new Special Representative ofthe Secretary-General for the Western Sahara.Resolving the conflict in the Western Sahara inkeeping with norms of international legality and withinthe framework of the United Nations would have thepositive effect of giving critical momentum to thebuilding of the Greater Arab Maghreb  which Algeriahas always called for.We can only agree with the Secretary-Generalwhen he puts development at the centre of his conceptof a new international economic order and gives itpriority attention within the United Nations agenda. Afew days ago  Member States evaluated progress madesince the September 2000 adoption of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs)  and we must admit thatthe results are not that encouraging  the case of Africabeing rather instructive. With regard to theimplementation of the eight goals of the 2000Declaration  we would say that some of them  such aspoverty reduction  have been deferred to a dangerouslyremote future.The requirement of adapting to new internationalrealities makes reform an obligation for ourOrganization. Such reform must be thoroughgoing andbalanced and serve and preserve the interests of asmany as possible. We cannot just have specificamendments for the ambitions of a small number ofMembers  legitimate though those ambitions may be.The reforms to be undertaken must  above all  satisfythe majority and serve the collective interests andcommon aspirations of all.The special attention given to the expansion ofthe Security Council is certainly justified  given thedominant role played by the Council in maintaininginternational peace and security  but we must not letthis cause us to lose sight of the legitimate demands ofAfrica  nor of the need to maintain balance among thevarious bodies. Given the fact that most of the Africancountries were excluded from the Conference for theUnited Nations at San Francisco because they werecolonies  it would be paradoxical  anachronistic andineffective if developing countries were now invited tovalidate reform proposals that ignore their interests andconcerns.In this exercise that we are undertaking under thewatchful eye of our peoples  let us work together andembrace a common vision that will ensure a future ofpeace and prosperity shared by the Member States thatthe United Nations has the duty to guarantee."
"49",2108,"ECU",60,2005,"The people of Ecuador wish to express their deepest condolences and fraternal solidarity to the South-East Asian nations affected by the tsunami  as well as to all our brothers and sisters living in the southern United States who were so severely affected by Hurricane Katrina.  Faced with the danger of natural disasters  Ecuador is committed to the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action and to support the International El Niño Research Centre  based in Guayaquil.  Today  the nations of the globe have come together to celebrate 60 years of human hopes  60 years after the proclamation of the founding Charter of the Organization that represents every man  every woman  and every child. Six decades have passed since we inaugurated this institution and its essential objectives of human coexistence  peace and the international rule of law. After six decades we can rejoice with old Neruda  who lives on in our hearts  along with Stravinsky  Garcia Marquez and Mother Teresa. Let us celebrate  but let us also take stock of the dream yet to be fulfilled. Sleeplessly  we face threats and challenges that affect the survival of our species. When the second millennium ended — quite unlike the first — our world was not threatened by the terror-filled visions of the apocalypse and the seven trumpets that would transform a third of the world into blood  darkness  smoke and locusts. However  our new millennium faces the reality of increasing poverty in two thirds of the planet. Water is becoming scarce  there are holes in the ozone layer and  along with biodiversity  the Amazon is being destroyed. Entire nations are being disinherited and condemned to roam the earth  mortal illnesses hover over humanity and terrorism lurks in every corner.  I have come from the middle of the world to speak of faith in the renewal of the dream. Ecuador is a small nation in South America sharing an identity with almost 400 million human beings living in an area of 8 million square kilometres. We have more than one fourth of the fresh water of the world and immense energy  mineral and food resources; we boast the greatest tropical rain forest in the world and colossal mountains  deserts and prairies. Yet  our region remains a realm of social injustice.    2 05-51226   The world order that governs us is not the one we want. It is unjust  inefficient and inhuman. We must therefore set in motion factors that were unimaginable in the middle of the twentieth century. The economy  international law and biology constitute a fundamental triangle from which the future of the human being can be projected. I set out for the Assembly the idea of building a new world order based on this trilogy.  First  with regard to international law  Ecuador reaffirms its commitment to the San Francisco Charter and the principles of non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples  the peaceful settlement of disputes  and the rejection of all forms of colonialism  discrimination or segregation. In accordance with these principles my country believes in the need to strengthen the Organization  transform it and democratize it. The United Nations must develop new mechanisms to protect the survival of our species and of all forms of life.  Secondly  the economy must eliminate marginalization and redress the unequal nature of opportunities  among both nations and individuals. This is the conflict. In 1945  the vital need to establish policies to promote a just and progressive distribution of surpluses was proclaimed. Nevertheless  60 years later we see ever more regressive patterns of distribution and growing gaps at all levels  basically produced by the tragedy inherent in the accumulation of foreign debt  which represents such a heavy burden for developing nations. The burden of the debt has pauperized our peoples. It has put a brake on productive development and cancelled out the aspiration of all to have access to food  health  shelter  safety and education. The ethical mandate of our time demands a change in the collective conscience of social welfare. Heavily indebted middle-income countries must organize their efforts to arrive at joint agreements with the world’s creditors.  Thirdly  the incorporation of biology into the new international order obliges the United Nations to transfer its focus from man to biology. The presence of this new factor — biology — brings with it the need to raise the level of ethics and international law to the highest degree of respect for biodiversity and the preservation of all forms of life. Ecuador attaches particular importance to this topic and is therefore concerned at the controversial spraying of glyphosate as a herbicide to eliminate illegal crops along border areas between Colombia and Ecuador. Studies on this substance suffer from technical and methodological shortcomings. Ecuador therefore calls upon the United Nations system to promote a comprehensive  reliable and credible study on the actual impact of this spraying. Ecuador considers that it is essential to apply the precautionary principle that has been recognized in many international agreements and other instruments  in particular the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. Consequently  Ecuador has asked its neighbouring Government of Colombia to suspend aerial-spraying activities in a 10-kilometre strip north of our border.  As I said in my statement during the High-level Plenary Meeting (see A/60/PV.5)  in my country’s opinion the Millennium Development Goals constitute a well-honed and effective tool for this century to carve out a path towards a more just humankind. I am firmly convinced that ethical regulations to preserve the biological heritage of the planet constitute the paramount goal for this third millennium. With conviction and resolve  my country has adopted a date for its future: 2015. Copies of the reports on my Government endeavours to attain the Millennium Development Goals are available in the General Assembly Hall.  I should now like to talk about migrants. Globalization is creating urgent demands for the new century. One of these arises from the pain that is giving rise to a new exodus. Today the United Nations must take over the role of a new Moses. It must lead the people to their homeland and provide the bread to calm the hunger of the wretched of the world. More than 175 million human beings have been forced to leave their homeland in search of better days. Today migrants are treated worse than capital or commercial goods: we are always looking to provide freedom of transit for these. The mere existence of this fact forces us to recognize that for the hungry of the third world there is no liberty and even less the equality and fraternity symbolized two centuries ago by the French revolution. The link between the migrant issue and development is undeniable and must be handled in a transparent manner based on a vision of shared responsibility on the part of all nations involved.  On migration routes we must overcome the police stigmatization of the undocumented. Regularization requires that the rights of migrants be viewed as a fundamental human right and must be reflected in every State’s population policy. The Government of   05-51226 3  Ecuador calls upon this forum to address the problem of migrants in terms of equality for all nationals. We propose that this problem be addressed at the high-level dialogue on international migration and development  to be held in 2006.  We in the Government of Ecuador  aware of the need for migration and its consequences to be treated in an integral and responsible manner  have approved a law revising our criminal code to define crimes of the sexual exploitation of minors and the trafficking of persons. In addition  we have placed before our National Congress a new proposal to punish all forms of trafficking in human beings.  I should like to talk about indigenous peoples and peoples of African descent. The International Decades of the World’s Indigenous People  proclaimed by the General Assembly  have been a valuable opportunity to increase awareness of the situation of our brothers and to promote respect for their identity and the chance to find viable solutions to their problems. The biology of the new world order requires recognition of their rights as protagonists of history and as leading actors in society. In the Ecuador of the last decade  indigenous peoples have been significant components of our social and political life. That is recognized in our Constitution and in International Labour Organization (ILO) Agreement 169.   In recent years  Ecuador has witnessed a serious deterioration in its democratic institutions. Faced with that situation  my Government has pledged to restore the rule of law by means of profound political reform legitimized through a referendum of the Ecuadorian people. We are determined to firmly fight the corruption that erodes democratic structures. Only three days ago  on 15 September  my Government deposited its instrument of ratification as the thirtieth State party to the United Nations Convention against Corruption  which made it possible for the Convention to enter into force.  The voice of my people  the people of Ecuador  echoes the deep-throated clamour of Latin America. We want to be part of a greater nation  South America  a human assembly that can make its voice heard and follow the path to genuine  just development accompanied by greater solidarity on behalf of the principles that we have recalled here.

"50",2153,"EGY",60,2005,"Atthis session we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of theestablishment of the United Nations. We also begin actively and seriously  our effort to revitalize thisstrong Organization  which humankind decided toestablish after it experienced two devastating warsduring the first half of the twentieth century. There isno doubt that this session has been convened at a timewhen international relations are undergoing majorchanges and when hope is being tempered by threats7and challenges to the stability of the internationalcommunity and the peace and security of all ourpeoples.Recent international developments have provedthe increasing need to strengthen the capabilities of themultilateral framework in addressing problems facingour nations and peoples and in achieving the requiredbalance on four issues that we consider to be at thecore of our contemporary interests: development international peace and security  human rights and theinstitutional reform of the Organization.Addressing the issue of development at theinternational level requires strong political will toimplement the commitments we have undertaken which we reaffirmed together in the outcome documentof the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1) primarily the implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals adopted at the MillenniumSummit  the revitalization of the internationalpartnership for development and the mobilization ofthe financial resources it requires  and the fulfilment ofthe commitment made by many developed countries toreach the target of 0.7 per cent of gross domesticproduct (GDP) in official development assistance by2015. I would like to take this opportunity to expressEgypt’s appreciation to the countries that havereaffirmed their commitment to fulfil their obligationsin that regard.In attaining our common goals  it is thereforeimperative to use the consensus we reached at theHigh-level Plenary Meeting as a platform to buildgreater consensus towards achieving the developmentpriorities of developing countries  especially during theupcoming Ministerial Conference of the World TradeOrganization  to be held in Hong Kong  and at otherinternational forums dealing with issues of importanceto the developing world  especially those of trade  debtrelief  investment and industrial modernization  as wellas other issues that can bring about the justice andopenness required in our international trading systemand provide developing countries with theopportunities they need to raise the living standards oftheir peoples.In fulfilling our long-standing commitments toachieve sustained economic growth and sustainabledevelopment in Africa  Egypt wishes to call upon ourpartners in developed countries to play a leading rolein support of the implementation of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). ThatAfrican-owned initiative constitutes an ambitiouspartnership for sustainable development that canensure Africa’s integration into the world economy lead to the achievement of good national andinternational governance and promote the contributionof civil society and the private sector in theachievement of our development goals.Along with achieving economic security for all  itis essential that we strive to achieve international peaceand security by practically and realistically addressingthe challenges and threats facing the internationalcommunity. Since terrorism is the most dangerousmenace of our times  Egypt actively contributed toreaching consensus on the Summit Outcomedocument’s condemnation of terrorism in all its formsand manifestations  as it constitutes one of the mostserious threats to international peace and security.Contrary to what some might have imagined  therecent terrorist attacks that have struck manycountries — including Egypt — have now made itclear that terrorism is a danger that does not distinguishamong peoples  cultures or religions; rather it is a non-discriminating threat to human civilization. Thoseattacks have also reminded us that counter-terrorismefforts should not be limited to enhancing measures tocombat terrorism or to finding ways to improve theirimplementation. Rather  they should include effectivelyaddressing the underlying causes of the phenomenon.Accordingly  Egypt has put forth an initiative toconvene a high-level meeting of the General Assemblyto draft and adopt a comprehensive plan of action thatincludes the necessary legal and practical measures todeal effectively with terrorism — without affecting theability of peoples under occupation to gain theirindependence in accordance with establishedinternational law and norms — until it is completelyeradicated.In conformity with that position  Egypt pledges toexert extensive efforts with a view to concluding acomprehensive convention on international terrorism.Such a convention  along with the 12 existinginternational counter-terrorism conventions  to whichthe International Convention for the Suppression ofActs of Nuclear Terrorism was added this year  couldconstitute the most comprehensive legal frameworkpossible to tackle this phenomenon.8The issues of disarmament and thenon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction relateto another major threat requiring concertedinternational action in the near future  specially as theHigh-level Plenary Meeting could not reach agreementon how to address those issues in a manner consistentwith their crucial importance and urgency to the safetyand security of the human race. Our commonendeavour should be based on restoring the balancebetween nuclear disarmament  non-proliferation andthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy: the three pillars ofprogress in achieving our common objectives. Thepoint of departure for our undertaking can only be theconsensus reached at the 1995 Review Conference ofthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT)  which constitutes an integralpart of the package that made possible the indefiniteextension of the NPT  along with the resolution on theMiddle East adopted at that Conference. Concertedinternational efforts  in particular by nuclear-weaponStates  to achieve the universality of the NPT areessential; otherwise  we risk having the Treaty lose itscredibility and relevance.To that end  we require strong political will torelaunch the United Nations disarmament machinery reinforce the mutual and balanced implementation ofcommitments and obligations set forth in existingtreaties  achieve the universality of those treaties priorto making any attempts to impose further obligationson States parties and fully respect the commitmentsentered into under those instruments. We also needdetermination to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zonein the Middle East  in order to support efforts to reacha just and comprehensive peace in the region.The establishment of the Human Rights Councilmust prove to be a landmark in the promotion of  andrespect for  principles and freedoms. Its mandate composition and methods of work must be formulatedin a democratic manner and be based on the principleof equitable geographic distribution while also takinginto consideration each region’s specific cultural andcivilizational characteristics. The Human RightsCouncil must also assist and encourage countries toimprove human rights and respect for the rule of lawon their territories. To that end  we must strengthen thehuman rights machinery and the rule of law in amanner that will enable us to redress existingshortcomings — in particular  politicization  selectivityand double standards — and as to promote coexistenceand dialogue among civilizations in contrast to thedivision and differences that characterize our currenthandling of these issues. In that connection  I agreewith the previous speaker  the Minister for ForeignAffairs of Australia.The Egyptian National Council on Human Rightshas been established in order to promote that effort. Itenjoys the institutional independence it needs to carryout its tasks with due impartiality and objectivity. Italso has the capacity to promote respect for humanrights and fundamental freedoms  including the right toparticipate in the formulation  prioritization andimplementation of national policies.We must also launch a coordinated multilateraleffort to promote human rights and to address rightsviolations by enhancing the capacity of States toprotect their populations against genocide  ethniccleansing  war crimes and crimes against humanity.Here  we must not capitalize on exceptional situationsas a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of States.In accordance with the Charter of the United Nationsand the relevant provisions of international law  wemust draw a line between the inability of a State toprotect its population against such crimes and itsunwillingness to do so.Our common efforts to ensure larger freedom forour peoples are closely linked to our resolve and abilityto settle current political issues  most notably in ourregion  the Palestinian question. While we welcome theIsraeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and a fewsettlements in the northern part of the West Bank  wealso call upon the Israeli Government to continuewithdrawing its troops from all Palestinian territoriesand to implement all of its commitments in thatrespect  in accordance with the road map  which shouldlead us to our common goal: the establishment of anindependent Palestinian State coexisting with Israel inmutual peace and security. However  until we reachthat goal  Israel must cease settlement activities in theWest Bank  stop building its separation wall  improvethe humanitarian situation of the Palestinians in theoccupied territories and launch final-status negotiationstowards a comprehensive settlement. Israel must alsowithdraw from the remaining Arab territories in Syriaand Lebanon occupied in 1967.Furthermore  we cannot address respect forhuman rights unless we address the human rightssituation in Iraq  particularly every Iraqi citizen’s right9to life. In that context  and despite the establishment ofthe Interim Government and the drafting of a newconstitution  national reconciliation among the entirebrotherly Iraqi people is still needed. We urgently needan increased understanding that violence and thekilling of innocent people will not lead to the desiredsecurity and stability for Iraq.Egypt will continue its support for the importantsteps taken by the Sudan towards peace and stability  inthe context of maintaining that country’s sovereigntyand territorial integrity. Egypt will continue to supportthe implementation of the Nairobi ComprehensivePeace Agreement on southern Sudan and the Cairoagreement complementing it. We will also participateactively in peace negotiations on Darfur under theauspices of the African Union and continue Egypt’ssupport by contributing troops to the United NationsMission in the Sudan  as well as observers to theAfrican Union Mission in Darfur.It is in that context that Egypt continues to placethe security and stability of Africa at the centre of itsregional and international policies. Egypt will thereforecontinue to increase its efforts to resolve contemporaryAfrican political problems. It has contributed  and willcontinue to contribute  to all peacekeeping operationsin Africa  as well as to support all of Africa’s ongoingefforts to implement an integrated approach todevelopment that covers all political  economic andsocial dimensions. Egypt’s commitment to Africa isbased on an unwavering conviction of our commondestiny and on the need for continued cooperation.Here  the African Union has a central role to play; itmust have the full support of the United Nations.Because of the particular importance that Africaattaches to the link between security and developmentin addressing situations in countries emerging fromconflict  Egypt has supported the establishment of theproposed Peacebuilding Commission. However  theactivities of the Commission must reflect a balanceamong the various mandates of the principal organs ofthe United Nations and the various steps taken intackling each issue. We also call for a leading in thework of the Commission role for both the GeneralAssembly and the Economic and Social Council  alongwith the Security Council. The Commission mustbecome neither a body to impose trusteeship on Statesnor an instrument to bypass the will and the nationalpriorities of States. The Peacebuilding Commissionmust always remain an effective advisory bodyfocusing on mobilizing assistance to post-conflictcountries on its agenda  in order to enable them toattain their national aspirations to sustainable peaceand stability.The United Nations will not be able to carry outall those increasing and challenging tasks unless weembark upon effective institutional reform that takesinto consideration the balance between theOrganization’s principal organs  that ensures theimplementation of the Organization’s tasks and thatenhances the credibility of the United Nations andeliminates the causes of the criticism it has beenfacing.There is no doubt that among the most importantpillars of institutional reform is the revitalization of theGeneral Assembly and the strengthening of its role asthe chief deliberative  policymaking  implementing andmonitoring body of the United Nations. The Assemblyshould cooperate with the Secretary-General within atransparent framework and should provide him with theauthority he needs to carry out his tasks effectivelywhile ensuring that he remains committed to the tasksmandated by the principal organs of the Organization.We look forward to the proposals that theSecretary-General is expected to present  includingthose on improving auditing and oversight  whichshould duly take into account the intergovernmentalnature of the existing budgetary and managementcommittees. We also look forward to undertaking through the General Assembly and other relevantbodies  a one-time review of mandates older than fiveyears  while emphasizing the need to avoid a mereregulatory approach to that issue and the imperative oftaking its political implications into consideration. Wemust never neglect the international political balance or affect ongoing efforts to resolve contemporaryproblems.In that context  the reform and expansion of theSecurity Council is becoming increasingly important particularly in the light of the Council’s role in themaintenance of international peace and security. Thatreform must ensure that the Security Council is morerepresentative of the general membership of theOrganization and more transparent in addressing theissues on its agenda. In that regard  I wish to stress thecommitment of Egypt to the African Common Positionon this issue  as set out in the Ezulwini consensus andthe Sirte declaration  which aims at fulfilling the10legitimate aspirations of our continent for permanentand balanced representation in an expanded SecurityCouncil and at remedying the existing imbalance in therepresentation of Africa in particular and of developingcountries in general.The outcome document that we adopted at theHigh-level Plenary Meeting marking the sixtiethanniversary of the United Nations (resolution 60/1) issolid proof of the vitality of the Organization and of agenuine desire that its essential role continue. We lookforward to working together to move ahead and toimprove the capacity of the United Nations to fulfil ourcommon objectives on the basis of firm political will toimplement the commitments agreed upon in thatdocument. We must expand the agreement’s scope toencompass all aspects of international action. That isthe only path available to us in order to attain ourpeoples’ aspirations to peace  security and stability."

I wish toassure him and his colleagues in the Bureau of mydelegation’s support as he guides our deliberations.Allow me also to thank his predecessor  Mr. Jean Pingof Gabon  for his effective leadership at the fifty-ninthsession of the Assembly.In addition  let me take this opportunity to extendmy country’s deep sympathy and condolences to allGovernments and peoples that have suffered tragiclosses of life and destruction of property as a result ofacts of terrorism and natural and man-made disasters.At this general debate  I wish to address theAssembly on a matter of grave and immediateimportance to my country that has seriousconsequences for the supremacy of international lawand the maintenance of regional peace and security.Almost four years after the decision of theEritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission  the darkclouds of war once again hang over my country. Thelegal provisions of the Algiers Agreement  the legalunderpinnings of the independent arbitration processand the manner in which that process was established and the unequivocal decision of the BoundaryCommission are all too well known to be repeatedhere. But allow me to cite the cardinal elements of theAlgiers Agreement to refresh members’ memories.Article 4.15 of the Algiers Agreement explicitlystates “The parties agree that the delimitation anddemarcation determinations of the Commissionshall be final and binding. Each party shallrespect the border so determined  as well as theterritorial integrity and sovereignty of the otherparty.”I must stress here that violation of the Agreementrepresents nothing less than blatant disrespect for theterritorial integrity and sovereignty of a United NationsMember State.In the sixteenth report on the work of theBoundary Commission of February 2005  when theCommission was forced to close down its field officesin Eritrea and Ethiopia  it warned that “... the line of the boundary was legally andfinally determined by its Delimitation Decision of13 April 2002. Though undemarcated  this line isbinding upon both Parties  subject to the minorqualifications expressed in the Delimitation23Decision  unless they agree otherwise. Conductinconsistent with this boundary is unlawful.”(S/2005/142  Annex I  para. 33)The Boundary Commission’s decision should notbe tampered with. In that regard  article 4.2 of theAlgiers Agreement unambiguously stipulates that “The parties agree that a neutral BoundaryCommission composed of five members shall beestablished with a mandate to delimit anddemarcate the colonial treaty border based on thepertinent colonial treaties (1900  1902 and 1908)and applicable international law. TheCommission shall not have the power to makedecisions ex aequo et bono.”The situation with which we are now confrontedis therefore not an intractable border dispute requiringthe flexibility of the parties. It is squarely a gravematter of an illegal and forcible occupation of thesovereign territory of Eritrea  a United NationsMember State  in clear violation of Article 2.4 of theUnited Nations Charter.Ethiopia is not only occupying the village ofBadme and other sovereign Eritrean territory; it alsocontinues to build illegal settlements in those areaswith a view to  in the words of Secretary-General KofiAnnan  creating facts on the ground.Ethiopia’s unrestrained assault on the rule of lawand the sanctity of treaty agreements will have severeconsequences not only for the people of the twoneighbouring countries and the Horn of Africa but through the bad precedent it sets  also for othercountries and regions  as well as for the credibility andthe legitimacy of the United Nations. Yet Ethiopia’sacts of occupation continue to be tolerated by theUnited Nations and the other guarantors of the AlgiersAgreement.Paragraph 14 of the Agreement on Cessation ofHostilities (S/2000/601  annex)  which is an integralcomponent of the Algiers Agreement  specifies that“OAU and the United Nations commit themselvesto guarantee the respect for this commitment ofthe two Parties until the determination of thecommon border ... This guarantee shall becomprised of:“(a) Measures to be taken by theinternational community should one or bothof the Parties violate this commitment including appropriate measures to be takenunder Chapter VII of the United NationsCharter by the United Nations SecurityCouncil;”.The United Nations and the African Union  asguarantors  are parties to the treaty. They haveobligations to ensure implementation of the AlgiersAgreement without preconditions. In the event thateither Eritrea or Ethiopia fails to implement theAgreement  the United Nations is empowered by theAgreement to invoke Chapter VII of the Charter withrespect to the reneging party.The treaty agreement must be enforced and thenumerous international instruments must be applied inorder to end occupation and restore legality. TheSecurity Council is mandated to maintain peace andsecurity  inter alia  by eliminating all forms ofoccupation. Unfortunately  the United Nations andsome members of the international community have sofar been advancing arguments that are irrelevant to theissue and are in contravention of international law inorder to decline from taking the appropriate action.Existing and aspirant members of the SecurityCouncil — both permanent and non-permanent — mustfully appreciate the fact that the cardinal principle ofthe Charter is that membership of the Security Councilmust be considered as service to humanity and thecause of peace and not as a means to promote andprotect their own interests or the interests of theirallies. They must uphold the sacred trust to protect thecredibility and viability of the United Nations.Respect for international agreements has been and must continue to be  the foundation of the principleof peaceful coexistence among nations. Anycompromise on that principle will result in the erosionof trust in the international system and will severelydamage the functioning of the United Nations.Eritrea and Ethiopia may soon be dragged onceagain into a new phase of armed conflict. Yet  there isstill an opportunity for a peaceful resolution if theUnited Nations honours its treaty obligations andaddresses the one core issue  Ethiopia’s illegaloccupation of sovereign Eritrean territory. If the UnitedNations fails to reverse the occupation  it will be asresponsible as Ethiopia for any renewed armed conflictand its consequences.24At this juncture  I wish to remind the Assemblythat the United Nations has betrayed the Eritreanpeople twice during the past 60 years. This would bethe third betrayal if it does not respect its treaty andCharter obligations by settling this occupation throughpeaceful means.In conclusion  I wish to inform the Assemblycategorically that Eritrea is determined  and has theright  to defend and preserve its territorial integrity byany means possible."
"52",2223,"ESP",60,2005,"Sixty years ago at San Francisco  the UnitedNations Charter was adopted. It was an event that setthe path for the future of nations and peoples. It was anevent at which intelligence was resolutely dedicated topeace and justice  and willpower was used for thecommon interest.With the adoption of the outcome document bythe High-level Plenary Meeting  a process of15paramount importance has been set in motion  one inwhich you  Sir  can count on the full support of thedelegation of Spain. I wish to pay tribute to thesustained effort of your predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  andto reiterate to our Secretary-General my admiration forhis personal and diplomatic skills.There can be no doubt that the United Nationshas taken a step forward as a result of the High-levelPlenary Meeting. We have achieved progress inessential areas. Spain is satisfied with the outcomebecause we have stressed the importance of assistingvictims of terrorism. The Alliance of Civilizationsinitiative has been well received. The summit recalledthe need to continue assisting middle-income countriesand supported the search for new sources of financingfor implementation of the Action against Hunger andPoverty initiative.I would like to mention here that an initiative onUnited Nations reform was unanimously adopted bythe Spanish Parliament on 13 September 2005  urgingthe Government to achieve a number of objectives thatare now reflected in the outcome document of therecent High-level Meeting. We recognized in thatdocument that development  peace and security andhuman rights constitute the three basic interdependentand interrelated pillars of the United Nations systemand are the foundation for our collective security andwell-being. In our globalized world  we can solveinternational problems  and deal with new challengesand risks only through concerted action based onsolidarity.Among those collective actions  the fight againstterrorism is an absolute priority for Spain. The GeneralAssembly should adopt a global strategy that includesthe goal of creating an international fund for victims.Spain has just signed the International Convention forthe Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism  and inthe Sixth Committee Spain is determined to promotethe adoption of a comprehensive convention oninternational terrorism before the end of this sixtiethGeneral Assembly.The summit concluded that tolerance  respect dialogue and cooperation amongst different cultures civilizations and peoples are essential elements for thepromotion of international peace and security. This isprecisely the conviction that inspired the President ofthe Government of Spain to propose the Alliance ofCivilizations initiative at the previous GeneralAssembly. The Secretary-General's High-level Groupto guide the initiative will hold its first meeting in mycountry this autumn. This initiative  co-sponsored bythe President of the Government of Spain and thePrime Minister of Turkey  is more necessary today thanever. It is imperative to put an end to the negative driftin mutual perceptions that is being fomented and usedby extremist groups.It is also urgent to find innovative and additionalsources of financing for development. For that reason Spain  along with five other countries  is promoting theAction against Hunger and Poverty initiative with theaim of identifying innovative and additional sources offinancing for development. In this regard  Spainactively participates in the cancellation of debt tobenefit the heavily indebted poor countries and ispreparing a plan to swap debt for public investment inkey human development areas in Latin America.Let me reiterate Spain's firm commitment topeacekeeping operations  which translates intosubstantial contributions of our armed and securityforces wherever needed  especially in the Balkans Haiti and Afghanistan. I would like to underline thehigh degree of commitment and professionalism shownby Spanish peacekeeping forces and recall with pridethose who have sacrificed their lives for internationalpeace and security. The creation of a PeacebuildingCommission is another outstanding achievement of thissummit. Spain  as an important contributor to theUnited Nations budget and to its peacekeepingoperations  is ready to participate actively in the workof this commission.Since its inception this Organization has beendetermined to provide the international communitywith a binding legal framework for the protection andpromotion of human rights. Spain shares this goal. Wehave strengthened our cooperation with the Office ofthe High Commissioner for Human Rights  and wehave increased our contribution to its budget. We arealso pleased with the establishment of a Human RightsCouncil and are fully prepared to contribute actively tothe work of this new council. Over the past year important legislative developments have occurred inmy country  and we have taken significant steps topromote real equality among citizens in areas such asgender violence and discrimination on grounds ofsexual orientation. The Government has also tackledthe situation of immigrant workers through the16implementation of a broad-ranging legalizationprocess.We firmly support the reform process aimed atstrengthening the effectiveness of the United Nations which will ensure the concrete implementation of itsresolutions. It is of little use to improve existingstructures  if there is no enforcement of compliancewith decisions. The United Nations must regain itscredibility. We believe that the reform  especially thatof the Security Council  must be the result of a broadagreement among all of us.I agree with the Secretary-General that ourgreatest failure has to do with non-proliferation anddisarmament. For Spain  nuclear proliferationrepresents a serious risk for international peace andsecurity. We are concerned about the illicit trade insmall arms and light weapons  and we support thepreparation of an international arms trade treaty.I cannot but mention here  once again this year the question of Gibraltar and the need to put an end tothis dispute through the implementation of the repeatedmandates of the General Assembly that have urgedSpain and the United Kingdom to continue theirbilateral negotiations  with a view to reaching adefinitive solution to the decolonization process  inaccordance with the relevant United Nationsresolutions. Spain is willing to work in a constructivespirit; this spirit is reflected in the creation of atrilateral dialogue forum  the aim of which is toproduce an atmosphere of mutual trust and cooperationfor the benefit and prosperity of Gibraltar and theregion as a whole.Next month  Spain will host the fifteenth Ibero-American Summit in Salamanca. It will be a meetingthat will constitute a turning point in the creation of atrue Ibero-American forum  with theinstitutionalization of its secretariat and themanifestation of a stronger will to contribute toeffective multilateralism.Spain pays particular attention to its relationswith its neighbours in the Maghreb region. Through anactive and comprehensive policy  Spain wishes toreinforce its cooperation with those countries  firmlysupporting political stability  respect for human rightsand those reforms that are put in place to consolidatethe rule of law and economic and social development.In this regard  Spain firmly believes that theWestern Sahara conflict  which has lasted for almost 30years  requires priority attention. The internationalcommunity must contribute to overcome the stalemateand offer  within the framework of the United Nations a just and definitive political solution  in accordancewith international law. To that end  Spain is developingan active diplomacy and believes that steps taken  suchas the recent appointments by the Secretary-General ofhis Personal Envoy and of the Special Representativefor the United Nations Mission for the Referendum inWestern Sahara  will provide the opportunity torelaunch the process.In the Middle East  the disengagement fromGaza  carried out with great skill and with greateffectiveness by the Israeli Government  mayconstitute a powerful driving force in the peaceprocess. It is only right to congratulate the Governmentof Israel for its decision. I also extend mycongratulations to the Palestinian National Authorityfor having significantly contributed to the entireoperation  so that it was completed in a peacefulmanner. Now that the disengagement has beensatisfactorily completed  the road map must againbecome the central framework for the peace process.Moreover  the time has come to increase our aidto Africa and to support African countries in theirefforts aimed at integration  peace and progress.The summit outcome document is a good startingpoint to continue working towards achieving theagreements that still elude us. We cannot allowinaction  lack of ambition or shortsightedness toprevent the successful conclusion of the task ahead.Sixty years ago the signatories of the United NationsCharter translated into an agreement a thought that wasas solid as it was simple: we can either walk togethertowards peace  or we will never find it. A year ago before this Assembly  the President of the SpanishGovernment recalled that the history of humanity doesnot give us many reasons to be optimistic. Let us workwith imagination and commitment to turn thisOrganization into an expression of common will  anOrganization legitimized by its effectiveness and itsuniversal character. Let us work so that some day wewill feel proud as human beings. We are the UnitedNations  and the people of the world expect us to act assuch in the face of the challenges and opportunitiesafforded to us in these times of change."
"53",2249,"EST",60,2005,"Allow me to begin bycongratulating Mr. Jan Eliasson  upon his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtiethsession. We have full confidence in him and in histeam. I would also like to commend Mr. Jean Ping forthe pivotal role that he played during the fifty-ninthsession.The leaders of the world gathered in this veryHall last week at the largest summit meeting in history.The outcome document adopted by the heads of Stateor Government has given us very concrete tasks for thefuture. The reform continues; we will have to maintainfocus and take important decisions during the sixtiethsession.My remarks today will be confined to a few maintopics  with a specific emphasis on Estonia’scontribution to our common goals.Development  security and human rights areinterconnected issues. It is inconceivable that globalprogress in those areas can be made without aneffective multilateral system  fully in line with theprinciples of the United Nations Charter. As wepointed out a week ago in the outcome document  nocountry can tackle today’s intricate challenges alone.Estonia is fully committed to strengthening the UnitedNations.We live in a global and interdependent world andwe thus need to combine our efforts. There has to becooperation among different organizations that havethe capacity for conflict prevention and peacekeepingoperations  as well as for providing for suchrequirements as logistical support and training.The United Nations cannot hope to find a UnitedNations solution for all problems. Estonia is pleased tosee that the United Nations is actively forging a deeperpartnership with various organizations. Estonia isactively participating in the common efforts of both theEuropean Union and NATO. We feel that the UnitedNations  the European Union and NATO should allcontinue working towards mutually fruitfulcooperation and towards greater predictability in termsof the allocation of resources. The more we coordinateour activities  the better will be the results we canachieve in dealing with conflict  poverty and humansuffering. The European Union has made greatheadway in developing battle groups  thus increasingour ability to react swiftly in crisis situations.Estonia will continue to contribute throughvarious organizations to the stability of Afghanistan Iraq  Sudan  Kosovo and the Middle East. Our long-term contribution to United Nations monitoring on theIsraeli-Lebanese border  our explosives-detectingteams in Afghanistan  our substantive presence —considering the size of Estonia — in Kosovo  ourassistance in training the new Iraqi police force and ourparticipation in stabilizing Iraq are just a few examplesof my country’s contribution to common efforts.Estonia also acknowledges the need to developAfrican peacekeeping and to provide better training forUnited Nations peacekeepers. We hosted a UnitedNations peacekeeping “train the trainers” course inEstonia just a few months ago  attended bypeacekeepers from some 30 countries.Over the years  we have shown our continuedcommitment to United Nations activities  includingpeacekeeping  in a very simple and unequivocalway — by paying regularly and on time the fullamount of our assessed contributions.The role of the international community does notend at the point where we manage to stop an ongoingconflict. As we all know  without adequate Statestructures  a country faces the risk of relapsing intoconflict. Therefore  Estonia welcomes theestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  andwe hope to see the first results of its work fairly soon.The next issue I would like to address isterrorism. Here  our position is unequivocal: terrorismis unacceptable in all circumstances  and we should beunited against it. We regret that the summit document37does not condemn the deliberate killing of civilians andnon-combatants.Estonia believes that the anti-terrorism strategyput forward by Secretary-General Kofi Annan shouldbe adopted and implemented. We consider theconclusion of the comprehensive convention againstinternational terrorism an utmost priority during thecurrent session of the General Assembly. Estonia fullyimplements all relevant United Nations SecurityCouncil resolutions and supports the initiatives of theUnited Nations and other international organizations inpreventing and combating terrorism. A few days ago Estonia signed the International Convention for theSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionis another pressing security concern. We regret that noagreement was reached on non-proliferation anddisarmament during the summit.There is a serious concern over slow progress inthe sphere of poverty eradication and the realization ofother Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).Estonia  together with other European Union memberStates  is increasing resources devoted to developmentcooperation. Despite our status as a new donor Estonia’s official development assistance in 2004 wasalready 0.08 per cent of gross national income. We aresteadily increasing our input  and this will also raiseour voluntary contribution to United Nationsdevelopment-related activities.No State will be able to achieve the MDGs aslong as it does not respect fundamental human rights.The second International Decade of the World’sIndigenous People coincides with the targeted timeframe for the accomplishment of the MDGs — 2015. Ifwe truly want to achieve the MDGs  we must focus onthe issues that matter most to people  includingindigenous peoples. The implementation of the MDGsin connection with the indigenous peoples has to beviewed within the broader context of the MillenniumDeclaration  which brings together the three basic aimsof the United Nations Charter — peace and security economic and social development  and human rights.One cannot  of course  fail to mention the matterof climate change  the relevance of which has becomeespecially clear after recent natural disasters. Indeed we have to step up global long-term cooperation so thatwe can produce real change.I would like to stress the significance of theHuman Rights Council. We see the Council as astanding Charter body  well-connected with otherUnited Nations structures  including the SecurityCouncil. Human rights violators should not have a seatat the Council.Estonia is committed to promoting human rightsas universal values that should be guaranteed for all.We are pleased that the summit agreed to double theregular budget for the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights within the nextfive years.I would like to stress Estonia’s firm belief in theextraordinary importance of democracy  goodgovernance and the rule of law. Estonia supports thecreation of the Democracy Fund  to which we willmake a financial contribution.Estonia applauds the agreement that we reachedon the responsibility to protect. We should all fulfilcommitments nationally  but we should also beprepared to deal with cases of genocide  war crimes ethnic cleansing and all other crimes against humanityurgently requiring outside intervention  even if it hasnot been requested. In such cases  the internationalcommunity has to take action.As a founding member of the InternationalCriminal Court  we are disappointed not to see anyreference to this Court in the outcome document. Wedeem the Court  as well as other instruments ofinternational justice  vital to counter impunity forinternational crimes.Sixty years ago  world leaders made a promise toprevent war  to defend human rights and to help thepeoples of the world to achieve safety  prosperity andfreedom. Let us be bold and try harder than ever toachieve these goals."
"54",2295,"ETH",60,2005,"Allow me to extend toyou  Sir  our warm congratulations on your election topreside over the historic sixtieth session of the General13Assembly. You can rest assured of the fullestcooperation of my delegation. We want to express ourappreciation to the President of the fifty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly  our brother  Mr. Jean Ping whose tenure as President of the Assembly coincidedwith momentous events at the United Nations thatrequired both wisdom and a great deal of competenceon the part of the President. Mr. Jean Ping showed hehad both  and he has made us all proud.We are  as usual  grateful to our Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  whose tenure of office willalways be remembered as a period of enormousdedication to the reform of the United Nations and of anoble effort to mobilize international support to combatextreme poverty.The outcome document which our heads of Stateor Government endorsed (resolution 60/1) reflects theglobal consensus on the fact that the reform of theUnited Nations is essential and timely. My delegationwelcomes the document  which outlines a far-reachingagenda for change.The achievement of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs) by those vulnerable to being thrown offtrack is critical to all  not just to those directly affected.It would be regrettable if targets that have so muchsignificance for the well-being of all were missed inthe course of the next 10 years due to failure on thepart of those directly affected or a lack of solidarity atthe international level. We strongly believe that thetargets are neither unrealistic nor unduly ambitious.It cannot be emphasized enough that  at the endof the day  those that have primary responsibility forprevailing over extreme poverty are those that aredirectly affected. But those that suffer from extremepoverty require the support of the internationalcommunity to stay on track to achieve the MDGs.In concrete terms  that means that officialdevelopment assistance and measures on debt reliefand trade need to be aligned with the realization of theMillennium Development Goals. In that regard  we areencouraged by the progress made at the Group of EightGleneagles summit. We were also encouraged by thecommitment of leaders at the High-level PlenaryMeeting to address the current distortions ininternational trade  including through the eliminationof agricultural subsidies. There is nothing moreimportant for low-income countries than a partnershipthat is predictable  consistent and based on previouslydefined mutual obligations.No amount of international cooperation will beenough to achieve the Millennium Development Goalsunless domestic conditions are met in all relevantareas. We in Ethiopia have been doing our level best inthat regard. We have spared no effort to change theeconomic situation in our country for the better  ourprimary focus being the rural sector. Ethiopia has madea tireless effort to implement the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.Despite all the complications and the absence of atradition of loyal opposition  the recent elections inEthiopia have demonstrated the depth of commitmentwe have to transform the tradition of governance inEthiopia ó a tradition that has been as remote fromdemocracy as it is possible to be. Those elections standout as a milestone in the process of democratization ofthe State and of society at large. Ethiopia has enteredinto a new era of a vibrant multiparty political system.In the area of peace - and particularly withrespect to peace in our subregion - we  along withlike-minded partners  will continue to be pillars forpeace and stability.On the fight against terrorism  Ethiopia willcontinue to discharge its responsibility in cooperationwith other peace-loving countries. Ethiopia rejectsterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We inEthiopia are determined to work with the internationalcommunity to implement the counter-terrorismstrategy.In connection with our deep aspiration for peace our only source of disappointment is the lingeringdispute we have with Eritrea. Ethiopia has beencontributing more than its share to resolve thatoutstanding problem. In his statement on Wednesday 21 September (see )  the Eritreanrepresentative officially threatened to use force againstEthiopia on the basis of the unfounded allegation thatpart of Eritrean territory is under Ethiopian occupation.I find it incumbent upon me to set the record straight.This is a problem that grew out of an act ofaggression committed by Eritrea against Ethiopia. It isno secret how Ethiopia managed to reverse the Eritreanaggression and how it created the conditions for apeaceful resolution of the crisis between the twocountries  based on legality  to which Ethiopia has been14and remains committed. Any suggestion  such as theone made by the Eritrean representative on Wednesday that Eritrean territory is occupied is a mockery of thetruth and an insult to the intelligence of theinternational community.The threat or use of force should have no place asa means of resolving disputes between States. That is aprinciple to which Ethiopia has adhered: before theEritrean act of aggression  after the aggression wasreversed and since. Regrettably  Eritrea's attitude isdifferent  as has been repeatedly evidenced on theground in our region and in statements made byEritrean officials in different forums  including theGeneral Assembly. The Eritrean Government needs tobe reminded that it should make no mistake: it will beheld accountable for its actions.Ethiopia has always been committed to the rule oflaw and to the maintenance of peace and stability. Ourfive-point peace plan of 25 November 2004 for movingforward towards peace with Eritrea  which waswelcomed by the international community demonstrates Ethiopia's seriousness in that regard.Eritrea knows that Ethiopia has been ready fordialogue  both to ensure the demarcation of theboundary on the basis of the decision of the BoundaryCommission and to normalize relations between thetwo countries.Eritrea abhors dialogue  perhaps because itsuspects that dialogue would eventually lead to peace.It is not clear whether the Government of Eritreabelieves that peace serves its interests. Perhaps thepeople of Eritrea need to be kept on their toes  withtheir gaze focused on artificial external adversity. Inany event  Eritrea has no reason to be angry at Ethiopiaor at the world. Eritrea dragged Ethiopia into war in1998 and now continues to be an obstacle to thenormalization of relations between the two countriesand peoples.The problem between Ethiopia and Eritrea hasnever been  and is not  a legal one; rather  it is politicalin nature  and Ethiopia has the political will to moveforward. We invite Eritrea to join us in that effort.Ethiopia does not believe at all in sabre-rattling  leastof all between countries that should have little time tospare from fighting extreme poverty.On the continental level  we are encouraged bythe dynamism that the new African Union has injectedinto the joint African effort for peace and stability.There is no doubt that reform of the United Nationscould create even greater possibilities for Africa toplay its proper role  not only within Africa but alsooutside the continent.Ethiopia continues to attach great importance tothe reform of the United Nations. We believe that although all our expectations have not been met  theHigh-level Plenary Meeting provided great impetus formaking progress  in terms of both achieving theMillennium Development Goals and advancing thereform of the United Nations. It is our hope that it willbe possible to make progress in the course of thissession.I would like to conclude by reiterating Ethiopia'scommitment to the United Nations  and itspreparedness to do whatever is necessary to contributeto efforts designed to make the Organization moreeffective and more representative."
"55",2341,"FIN",60,2005,"Let me begin by notingthat Finland is pleased to see you  Sir  preside over thismost crucial of General Assembly sessions. We alsosalute your predecessor  Jean Ping of Gabon  whoworked tirelessly and successfully to strengthen theUnited Nations and make it more relevant.At the Millennium Summit five years ago  we seta forward-looking and ambitious agenda for the UnitedNations in the new millennium. Our success there wasthe result of a unique common political will and anoptimistic  can-do spirit. Through the endeavours at theSummit  that spirit was strengthened and deepenedamong world leaders. We built on that success inMonterrey and Johannesburg. There was hope that theworld was moving towards a positive cycle  that all ourboats would be lifted and that both new and old threatswould be met with a common resolve.The outcome document adopted at the worldsummit held last week was  in many respects  a stepforward. In others  we failed to match the expectationsof our peoples. That  however  does not necessarilysignal a permanent erosion of our common politicalwill and our common agenda. Rather  I am confidentthat it was primarily a result of the enormity of the taskat hand: to reaffirm the goals agreed upon five yearsago  to assess and expedite the progress made sincethen and to fundamentally reform the United NationsOrganization ó all at the same time. We are confidentthat under your leadership  Mr. President  the GeneralAssembly will be able to make further significantprogress at the current session. Let me pledge Finland'sfull support to you  Sir  as we prepare to assume thepresidency of the European Union during the secondhalf of next year.Finland aligns itself with the statement madeearlier by the United Kingdom on behalf of theEuropean Union. Let me make just a few additionalcomments of substance.First  if one were to try to identify the singlebiggest positive outcome of the momentous processunder way at the United Nations since the Secretary-General's ""fork in the road"" speech two years ago (seeA/58/PV.7)  it would probably be the near-universalacceptance of the close linkage between development security and human rights. Compared with five yearsago  we now view all issues in a truly integratedfashion. Above all  it is the broad realization of the23pivotal role of the rule of law for both security anddevelopment that strikes us as almost revolutionary.I would particularly stress the centrality of therule of law in promoting sustainable development andsustained economic growth. The solid foundation ofthe rule of law is needed more than ever if we are tosupport developing countries in building their nationalcapacity to create wealth and to take off economically.Finland is happy to note the increased attentionand resources being devoted within the whole UnitedNations system to supporting the rule of law andrelated activities. Much more  however  needs to bedone. We must remember that accountability and goodgovernance at the global level start at the nationallevel  by strengthening domestic democraticinstitutions  internal democratic processes  the rule oflaw  independent judiciaries and the role ofparliaments. It is in those areas that the United Nationscan and must assist needy Member States in buildingtheir national capacities.Secondly  an area that we would like to seediscussed and further elaborated here at the UnitedNations is the interrelationship between developmentand social justice. As the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme's Human Development Report 2005 put it deep disparities based on wealth  region  gender andethnicity are bad for growth. The report goes on to addwhat we already knew  namely  that such disparities arebad for democracy  as well as bad for social cohesion.Thirdly  I would target corruption as a scourgethat undermines both the rule of law and social justice.Corruption - the exploitation of a position ofinfluence for private benefit - is a serious obstacle todevelopment. It erodes the foundations of democracyand of viable economic structures. Our own experienceshows that a value base that promotes moderation personal restraint and the common good tends to checkcorruption. The same goes for legislative  judicial andadministrative structures that closely monitor andguard against abuses of power. Other factorscontributing to a low level of corruption include theprominence of women in political decision-making andlow income disparities within the population. Lowcorruption often correlates with high economiccompetitiveness and increased efficiency ingovernance. I would strongly urge the United Nationsand the United Nations system as a whole to redoubletheir efforts to help Member States fight corruption. Itis of the essence if we are to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs).Fourthly  on the subject of the environment  Iwould stress the complementarity of the JohannesburgPlan of Implementation and the MDGs. Goal 7  toensure environmental sustainability  is essential forachieving other MDGs on poverty  health  educationand gender equality. The protection and sustainablemanagement of the natural resource base is necessaryfor development and poverty eradication. Alldeveloped countries need to make substantive efforts toprevent the destruction of ecosystems  inter alia through the promotion of sustainable production andconsumption.Those challenges cannot be successfully metwithout effectively tackling the challenges of climatechange and biodiversity loss. To that end  we need topromote energy efficiency  the conservation and wideruse of alternative energy sources and technologicalinnovation. We wish to see a rapid initiation ofnegotiations to develop a more inclusive - and in thelonger term more effective - international frameworkfor climate change beyond 2012.We also need a more coherent institutionalframework for international environmental governance.As the European Union has previously stated  Finlandbelieves that the creation of a new United Nationsspecialized agency for the environment - based on theUnited Nations Environment Programme  but with arevised and strengthened mandate - would best servethat end.The fifth issue I would like to highlight is that ofsmall arms and light weapons  which - likecorruption - was identified as one of the priority areasof the Helsinki Process on Globalization andDemocracy. That Process  which culminated two weeksago in the Helsinki Conference  was tasked withcoming up with concrete proposals on how to enhancehuman security across the globe. Reckless trade andbadly guarded stockpiles have led to a world awash insmall arms and light weapons  where human rights areviolated  humanitarian aid looted and economicdevelopment halted - at gunpoint.Finland has also called for an end to irresponsiblearms trading through better international regulation.The main ideas are to make all arms transfers fullytransparent and to establish universally acceptedcriteria for them. We are of the opinion that those24criteria should be strictly enforced  legally binding andfirmly founded on human rights considerations. That iswhy we have supported the initiative to negotiate anarms trade treaty. It is high time to bring the rule of lawto the international arms trade.Last but not least  I would join those who havestressed the need for the United Nations to take promptaction towards further management reform. This is anissue which cannot wait  as the very credibility of theOrganization is at stake. In the light of recent eventsrelated to the Organization  if there is a perceptionamong the public that it is business as usual at theUnited Nations  we risk undermining the support thatthe Organization enjoys. It is therefore obvious that anunreformed Organization would be less  not more relevant  and less  not more  effective. We must stressthe rule of law and good governance internally withinthe United Nations  just as we stress it externally.Reaching common positions and devising jointaction at the international level requires patience andpersistence  and a willingness to take practical andpragmatic steps. If such an approach is taken  we areconfident that the sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly will be a success."

We wish to expressour confidence in his ability to guide our work during2005 and 2006.We also extend our appreciation to hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping of theGabonese Republic  for his outstanding guidance of thedifficult business of the fifty-ninth session. We alsowould like to place on record our appreciation to theSecretary-General for his tireless efforts and active rolein bringing about an outcome document that shouldbecome the centrepiece that guides our efforts in themany months to come.Last week the leaders of our States orGovernments adopted a resolution on the outcome oftheir deliberations. The outcome document (resolution60/1)  as anticipated  did not meet the expectations ofeveryone; rather  it contained those key elementsessential to addressing the three pillar issues ofsecurity  human rights and development.What is required of us now is the commitment tosupport the implementation plan that will be drawn upto convert to action what have up to now been merelyhopes and aspirations. We must also undertake toensure that the assistance so rendered trickles rightdown to the poor  the hungry  the needy and thehopeless — those that require it the most. Far too oftendonations  funds and other forms of assistance aremired in the bureaucratic process and reduced bycertain percentages  which are then passed off asso-called administrative charges.Fiji fully endorses the outcome document  and weare committed to implement those provisions that weas a developing nation are required to pursue forourselves. The formulation and implementation of theFiji national sustainable development strategy outlining the visions of our leaders and targeting theaspirations and objectives of the summit outcome andthe Millennium Development Goals  is paramount. Weare in the process of reforming our public and financialsector and introducing limited changes in the privatesector. Infrastructure development and improvementare a priority in light of our occupational health andsafety standards. Marine legislation and regulations arebeing reviewed to ensure the safety at sea of both30passengers and vessels alike  as well as the protectionof our maritime resources such as our continental shelf.The principle of restorative justice in pursuit ofreconciliation  tolerance and unity is being widelydiscussed through a democratic process ofconsultations among the public before it is introducedin Parliament.Concerning the reform of the United NationsSecretariat  Fiji subscribes to the thinking that theSecretary-General should be empowered to enact thechanges he believes best suit the Organization. Wemust all help to create a United Nations Organizationthat is more efficient and accountable. Accountabilitycan be achieved by the establishment of the muchdiscussed Oversight Committee  the modalities andworking methodology of which have to include clearand transparent terms of reference and a well-balancedregional representation.The United Nations must function always withintegrity and urgent concern for the needs of MemberStates. Above all we must help the United Nations toconcentrate  as never before  on reducing the shamefulgap between developed and developing countries.There should be no pause in United Nationsendeavours to establish and maintain internationalpeace  security and stability. The Secretary-Generaland his staff are to be commended for seeking peaceagreements or in trying to prevent disputes fromviolently escalating. Peacekeepers from many troop-contributing countries deployed to conflict zones areworking not only to provide security but also todisarm  demobilize and reintegrate former fighters  topermit the safe and sustainable return of refugees andto strengthen human rights and the rule of law.We commend the work of the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq andthe United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq(UNAMI) in trying to promote an inclusive participatory and transparent political transitionprocess in the country. Fiji is privileged to have ourtroops serving in UNAMI to help in the process.Fiji reaffirms its commitment to the UnitedNations. As always  we are for peace and this is thereason we have sent many of our soldiers and policeofficers to serve with United Nations peacekeeping andpeacebuilding forces. Many of our servicemen havelost their lives  but we have accepted this ultimatesacrifice as our contribution to the unceasing globaleffort for finding peace and security.Further  while fully appreciating the principle ofthe standby force  we are at the same time concernedby the fact that those nations who are unable toproperly equip their forces are mainly from developingcountries and will therefore be marginalized should noarrangement be made to assist them in this area. If suchassistance is not forthcoming  then peacekeeping willbe confined to only a select few countries  mainlydeveloped nations.Fiji acclaims the proposal for a PeacebuildingCommission. We will gladly share with theCommission our own experiences in reconstructing ourcountry following the civil unrest that almost tore thenation apart in 2000. We ask reconsideration regardingthe makeup of the Peacebuilding Commission  forwhile some of us have served in that sphere longer thanothers  the size of certain countries’ contribution givesthem an advantage under the current modalities.We support the United Nations and other majorgroups’ initiatives at establishing partnerships withregional groups. The South Pacific region hasconstantly come together to address common problemsthat may beset its members. The RegionalAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands is apeacekeeping/peacebuilding mission that was mountedby the region. We would urge the United Nations tokindly assist in the humanitarian effort to bring thisregional initiative on an even keel.Fiji is supportive of an enlarged Security Councilmembership that reflects current geopolitical realities.We maintain our support for the inclusion of India andJapan as permanent members under revisedarrangements.We look forward to the moment when peacefinally reigns in the Middle East  and we commend allthose countries that are helping with that global cause.For our Pacific Ocean region  we would like to see theKorean people find just peace and lasting harmony. Onthe future of Taiwan  it is Fiji’s fervent hope that aresolution through dialogue  conducted in the truespirit of reconciliation and understanding and devoid ofviolence  can be found — one that is agreeable to allparties and that can last for years to come.This age of globalization is marked by theadoption of universal principles governing such31matters as democracy  human rights  trade anddevelopment. Fiji accepts those precepts; there is noquestion about that. But we also say that countries likeours  undergoing profound transition  should not beheld to unrealistic standards. We need time to evolve to adapt and to adhere. Members should not judge usby what might be appropriate to their standards  butmeasure us by the progress we are making towards theuniversal ideals and the level of our commitment tochange.Fiji respects the principle of equality of humanrights. We endorse the proposal for a Human RightsCouncil  directly accountable to the General Assembly as an improvement upon the present arrangements.However  in order for the Council to be effective  itsmembers have to be as widely representative aspossible and should not be subjected to specialreporting requirements.For Fiji  it is vitally important  as a factor forlong-term stability  that the special interests of theindigenous people  including their right to ownershipof their natural resources  is protected  and that abalance between the rights of individuals andcommunities is maintained. This has particularrelevance for a multicultural society such as ours. Inthis regard  we strongly endorse the intention to bringto the General Assembly as soon as possible foradoption a final draft Declaration on the Rights ofIndigenous Peoples.To fund the Millennium Development Goalsdeveloping countries ought to have access to marketsand a fair return on their exports. This fact is importantfor Fiji and other small vulnerable States; our veryeconomic survival is dependent upon it. Unrealisticand inequitable world trade policies simply make itmuch harder for our countries to eliminate poverty.Fiji commends those developed States that areprepared to assist developing nations in cushioning theimpact of World Trade Organization compliance. Wepay particular tribute to the European Union for itswillingness to assist and call on our European Unionpartners to provide adequate long-term support as itbegins to reduce preferential processes for African Caribbean and Pacific sugar.We also would like to express appreciation to ourclose neighbours Australia and New Zealand and ourfriends in Asia for their support in helping us get betteraccess to their markets and assistance in otherimportant areas of development.The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a global concern as itimpacts on our ability to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. A cooperative effort by everyoneremains the only way to control and eradicate thescourge. Action that integrates prevention  treatmentand the medical and social vulnerability of infectedpersons should be our guiding principles.At the same time we should not minimize theseriousness of the ravages produced of other infectiousdiseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Effortshould also be directed at other scourges  such asextreme poverty and the plight of the disabled.We can no longer ignore the plight of women andchildren who through the years have been subjected tosexual exploitation and abuse. Last week  Fiji’s PrimeMinister  Laisenia Qarase  signed the two OptionalProtocols of the Convention on the Rights of the Child;the first on the involvement of children in armedconflict and the second on the sale of children  childprostitution and child pornography. In addition Fijistrongly believes that the time is right for strongeraction to be taken to address the issue of young womenwho are denied the right to sexual and reproductivehealth.We welcome the decision to hold a 2006 GeneralAssembly High-level Dialogue on InternationalMigration and Development. The amount ofremittances from migrant workers has become a richsource of funds and has raised the standards of livingof families  contributed substantially to the nationaleconomy and provided much needed employment tothe job market. Fiji hopes that the High-level Dialoguewill be the catalyst to enable countries to work inpartnership and agree to a better understanding toimprove the conditions of migrant workers.Terrorism is a blight on all our horizons. Itrespects no borders  and it is neither an acceptable noran effective way to advance any cause. Insularity is nolonger a cushion to protect islands which believethemselves to be further away from the mainstream ofinternational activities. In trying to fulfil the terms andconditionalities established by the various terrorismconventions  more money that can hardly be spared hasto be found to fulfil those obligations. In doing so efforts to achieve Millennium Development Goals arestymied and in some instances halted.32In this regard  a global effort to combat terrorismhas to be instituted to include training  funding transparency in the exchange of information andintelligence  and a pledge to assist when needed.Fiji will always be in support of all efforts toreform the United Nations and its initiatives in thefields of security  human rights and development. Ourefforts will be modest but commensurate with ourabilities."
"57",2432,"FRA",60,2005,"Speaking for the first time from this rostrum  I wish toreaffirm here the importance France attaches to themultilateral system. Our common future cannot beenvisaged without strengthening it.The declaration adopted the day before yesterdayis a milestone in that direction  even if it does not meetall our expectations. Indeed  the text makes somesignificant advances. I am thinking in particular ofinnovative financing for development. I am alsothinking of the decision to establish a peacebuildingcommission within the Security Council. Finally  I amthinking of the establishment of a Human RightsCouncil and the endorsement of the principle of theresponsibility to protect. Now it is up to us to put thosenew concepts into practice.In that connection  I wish to pay tribute here tothe remarkable work that has been done under thestewardship of Mr. Jean Ping.But let us not underestimate the extent of the taskthat still remains to be accomplished  be it in the areasof counter-terrorism  non-proliferation  SecurityCouncil reform or development assistance.The United Nations is founded on the rule of lawand the promotion of universal standards. Those reflectour common values and our conviction that there canbe no security and development without scrupulousrespect for human rights. This is not a moral questionbut one of respect for the identity of every individual.It is not a matter of passing judgement but of enablingall people to live in greater freedom and in dignity.Let us reject the impressment of children inarmed conflicts  the systematic use of sexual violenceagainst women and girls as a weapon of war  therecourse to threats  arbitrary detention and torture ofopponents  journalists  labour leaders and defenders ofhuman rights. And  let us conclude the negotiations ona convention against forced disappearances. To thatend  let us strengthen the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and promptlyestablish the Human Rights Council.France particularly welcomes the fact that theinternational community now has the necessarylegitimacy to exercise effectively its responsibility toprotect populations threatened by ethnic cleansing crimes against humanity and genocide. France alsowelcomes the progress of the international criminaljustice system  in particular through the action of theSecurity Council. Those who believe they can count onthe international community not to act when theycommit their crimes should make no mistake: they willbe held accountable.Sixty years after the founding of the UnitedNations  terrorism is now at the top of the list of humanrights violations. Nothing — no cause  religion ormoral order — can justify attacks on the lives ofinnocents  the lives of civilians. We must define acts ofterrorism once and for all so that we can better combatthat barbaric practice which sets humankind back.17The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionconstitutes another major threat for the planet  againstwhich we must remain united and determined.France  together with its British and Germanpartners  has proposed to Iran a constructive approachpaving the way for a new relationship between thatgreat country and the international community. Thatrelationship is currently compromised by concerns overIran’s nuclear programme. We ask Iran to build trust byproviding objective guarantees on the exclusivelypeaceful nature of its programme. Iran’s statementsfrom this rostrum compel the international communityto meet its responsibilities  as referral of the matter tothe Security Council is on the agenda in order tostrengthen the authority of the International AtomicEnergy Agency. The very integrity of the non-proliferation regime is at stake.But let us also work to reduce the proliferation ofsmall arms and light weapons  which fuel so many verydeadly conflicts.To better serve peace and ensure the security ofpopulations  the Security Council has expanded itsfield of action to the trafficking that finances conflictsand the impunity that protects traffickers  using  inparticular  sanctions and embargoes. The UnitedNations is resolutely engaged on the ground  at thevery heart of conflicts. More than 70 000 bluehelmeted soldiers and police officers are now servingin 18 peacekeeping operations  and thousands of othersare operating under Security Council mandates.The results can be seen  for example  in Timor-Leste  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Burundi Liberia and Sierra Leone. But as countries emerge fromcrisis  it is essential that they continue to benefit fromour full attention and support. The United Nations hasthe duty to take a central role in the transition phasethrough the Peacebuilding Commission.Other situations demand great vigilance and ahigh level of mobilization. Thus  in Haiti  the presenceof strong contingents of United Nations soldiers andpolice must lead to the strengthening of the politicalprocess by involving all peaceful forces withoutexception. Preparations for elections must beaccelerated. Like all peoples  the Haitian people  whohave suffered for too long  are entitled to respect andfreedom.In Côte d’Ivoire  the presence of the UnitedNations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire and theappointment of a High Representative of the Secretary-General for the elections should also help strengthenimplementation of the process set out at Marcoussisand Pretoria.But in Côte d’Ivoire  as in Haiti  the determinedaction of the united international community will notproduce results unless all parties cooperate in goodfaith and demonstrate their sense of responsibility. InAbidjan as in Bouaké  all must respect their pledgedcommitments so that free and transparent elections canbe held throughout the country. No other solution ispossible. That is why it is essential to resolutelysupport the electoral process that has begun  as well asthe demobilization  disarmament and reintegrationprogrammes. All Ivorian parties must understand thatthey will not block the peace efforts with impunity ifthey take an obstructive stance  make hate speeches orchallenge democratic rules. The Security Council willmeet its responsibilities.The situation in Lebanon demonstrates what canbe accomplished by a determined internationalmobilization  supported by the courageous will of thepeople. Most Syrian forces have now left Lebanon.Elections have been held. A representative Governmenthas been formed. Our Organization must continue tosupport the Lebanese Government’s efforts to recoverfull sovereignty and exercise its authority over thewhole of its territory. At the same time  we mustcontinue to support the work of the commission ofinquiry into the assassination of Rafik Hariri. We aredetermined to see justice done.Also with respect to the Middle East  a dynamicof hope  which could touch all States of the region  isemerging following Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza.France  together with its European partners  standswith the Palestinians to rebuild and develop thatterritory so that its inhabitants can move around freelyand have access to jobs and  quite simply  to decentliving conditions.But we must not stop there. It is important torestore political prospects for relaunchingimplementation of the road map by  on the one hand encouraging the Palestinians to redouble their effortson security and  on the other  encouraging the Israelisto take the measures necessary to stop settlementactivity and to comply with international law in their18struggle for security. Peace can come only with theexistence of two peaceful and democratic States livingside by side in peace and security.Finally  with respect to Iraq  France remainsengaged so that  with the assistance of the UnitedNations in particular  the Iraqi people can acquiredemocratic institutions with which all Iraqis can feelidentified. It is clear that a policy focused exclusivelyon security leads to the retrenchment of a community thus jeopardizing the cohesion of Iraqi society and thecountry’s unity. In Iraq  too  the political process mustnot exclude any representative  peaceful force  and thepolitical process must offer Iraq the prospect of therestoration of its complete sovereignty.In all those crises  the Security Council hasgradually imposed the authority of the United Nationsin the service of international peace and security. Itsaction is legitimate  and its authority will be furtherstrengthened when we reach agreement on anenlargement of the Council that reflects the emergenceof new Powers and which gives an equitable place toall continents.At the same time  it is important to carry out thethorough management reforms that our Organizationrequires. In his report entitled “In larger freedom”(A/59/2005)  the Secretary-General proposed elementsof an action plan and initiated the first reforms. I paytribute to his resoluteness and reaffirm France’sdetermination to support him in his approach.We all know that security and developmentcannot be separated. Five years after the MillenniumSummit  heads of State or Government have just issueda troubling assessment of the implementation of theMillennium Development Goals.The outcome document they adopted (resolution60/1) clearly sets out the priorities on which we musttake action. The first of those sadly remains foodsecurity  because  as underlined by the Declaration onAction Against Hunger and Poverty  adopted in 2004on the initiative of President Lula and PresidentChirac  hunger remains the worst weapon of massdestruction. It continues to kill several hundred millionmen  women and children around the planet. We cansee it happening right now in the Sahel and southernAfrica. That scourge belonging to another age can andmust be fought.Of course  emergency humanitarian aid must beprovided to people in distress. That impliesstrengthening the coordination of United Nationsinterventions and  in particular  the establishment of aninternational humanitarian force  as proposed onseveral occasions by France.But beyond that  it is important to provide allareas at risk with the technical resources for preventionand early warning. Above all  it is essential to createthe conditions for sustainable development to thebenefit of all. That is the aim of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  whose attainment requiressubstantial long-term financing. Official developmentassistance will continue to be primary for much time tocome. The summit’s outcome document recalls theinternational commitments made in that regard  whichFrance and the European Union will respect. It isurgent that the other developed countries make thesame commitments. But we know well that this willnot be sufficient. Additional long-term resources haveto be found through innovative financing mechanisms.France endorses the establishment ofinternational solidarity contributions. Over 66countries have given their support to the pilot projectto levy a tax on airline tickets  and we welcome this. InFebruary  France will host a ministerial conference onthis initiative so that it can be implemented specificallyand promptly.By devoting three of the eight Goals to health  theMillennium Declaration has put public health back atthe centre of sustainable development. In terms of itsscope and socio-economic impact  the HIV/AIDSpandemic is of concern to us all. Only by workingtogether will we be able to deal with it  through anapproach that integrates prevention  treatment  care andthe medical and social vulnerability of infectedpersons. France wants to carry out this integratedapproach with its European partners and with theWorld Health Organization  the Joint United NationsProgram on HIV/AIDS and the Global Fund to FightAIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. We must doeverything possible to achieve universal access totreatment by 2010  if need be promoting greaterflexibility of intellectual property rights as provided forin the Doha international trade agreements.The fight against AIDS requires us all to mobilizeour efforts. For its part  France has pledged to doubleits contribution to the Global Fund  increasing the19amount to 300 million euros by 2007. At the sametime  international cooperation must take into accountthe particular challenges faced by certain categories ofindividuals: victims of abject poverty who areexcluded  young women denied the right to sexual andreproductive health  those with disabilitiesmarginalized by society.From the Indian Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico from Japan to Antarctica  man is confronted today withan unprecedented rise in environmental threats that hehimself has caused. Scientific proof of the reality ofclimate change and its human origins are irrefutable.All initiatives must be compatible with the KyotoProtocol; prospects must be charted for the future ofthe multilateral climate regime after 2012. Francewould hope to see more robust commitments especially regarding the transfer of technologies toemerging countries. To respond to the threat and moreeffectively mobilize energies and resources  France andEurope have proposed the establishment of aspecialized agency  based on the United NationsEnvironment Programme  for the purpose ofcoordinating international action. This idea ismentioned in the summit’s outcome document; it mustnow be translated into reality.The United Nations is commemorating its sixtiethanniversary this year. The world has changedprofoundly since 1945. Millions of men and womenhave gained freedom and have emerged fromunderdevelopment. Technological progress has beenstaggering and has radically changed the life of societyand relations among States. Challenges and threatshave changed; they are now worldwide and jeopardizehumanity itself.Yet  we must remain optimistic. It is not too late given that we understand what is at stake and that wemobilize collectively. The United Nations isrediscovering the way charted for it by the foundingfathers: helping in the peaceful settlement of disputes building international cooperation for development andpromoting human rights.We need the United Nations more than ever; it isthe sole framework for universal comprehensive actionwhich is legitimate and recognized as such by allStates. Let us give it our full support. France for itspart makes this commitment."
"58",2457,"FSM",60,2005,"Itake this opportunity to congratulate President Eliassonon his election to lead our deliberations during thisvery important session of the General Assembly. Iwould also like to pay tribute to our outgoing Presidentof the fifty-ninth session  His Excellency Mr. Jean21Ping  and our Secretary-General for their tirelessefforts and very considerable contributions to thesuccessful outcome of the High-level Plenary Meetingthat concluded just a week ago.This year  at this historic session  wecommemorate a milestone in the rich history of theOrganization as we celebrate its sixtieth anniversary.For us in Micronesia  the occasion also marks thefifteenth anniversary of our joining the United Nations.We are proud and motivated to be part of this greatOrganization.Our celebrations  however  should have a noblepurpose beyond honouring the past and the present.This occasion should give focus to the long road aheadof us. Inspired by the accomplishments of the past 60years  we must forge ahead with strong determination confidence and vigour to meet the challenges that thefuture holds for the Organization.The Federated States of Micronesia does notpretend to believe that the problems that we are calledupon to tackle are easy; they are not. But while wehave differences of opinion as to how they may beeffectively addressed  my delegation is encouraged bythe broad consensus that was reached during the high-level panel meetings last week that the reform of theUnited Nations and the attainment of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) must be addressed oneway or another and sooner rather than later. No doubtthe consensus was forged in the conviction that theUnited Nations  with all its shortcomings  stillrepresents the best hope for humankind to solve itsproblems at the multilateral level. If that is the case  asmy country firmly believes it is  the Organization mustbe reformed to reflect present day realities and toeffectively and efficiently achieve its enduringobjectives as enshrined in the Charter. For the sake ofour Organization’s credibility  for its long-termsustainability  and for the millions of people around theglobe that pin their hopes on the United Nations  theOrganization must be reformed. My delegation fullysupports the call that has been made within the GeneralAssembly Hall for its comprehensive reform.Consequently  let us give full consideration to thereform of the Security Council. The challenges of thetwenty-first century demand that we should do so. Withthe indulgence of members  I do not wish to go intodetails here  as the position of my Government on theissue has already been made known on severaloccasions. I would only reiterate our call for theinclusion of Japan and Germany  among the developedcountries  as permanent members of the Council because we believe they will contribute greatly to themaintenance of peace and security. For thoseaforementioned reasons  we also support the inclusionof India  a developing country  as a permanent memberof the Security Council. Moreover  we will support theinclusion of other developing countries from otherregions  if that reflects the choice of those regions. Weurge Member States to take bold and decisive action onthis issue.The time has come for the “enemy State” clausesin the United Nations Charter to be removed. Theyhave long become obsolete. The outcome documentrightfully reflects that fact.The sixtieth General Assembly could not havebeen more timely. It can take up the noble butincomplete task of reinforcing and facilitating the fullimplementation of the outcome of last week’s summit.We have little choice but to complete that which wasleft unfinished.Consistent with the broader agenda of thedebates  we wish to reiterate the great importance thatwe attach to the second phase of the World Summit onthe Information Society (WSIS) to be held in Tunisia inNovember. For my country  whose population isdispersed on many islands scattered over a vast area ofthe Pacific  access to affordable and reliableinformation and communication technologies (ICTs) iscritical to the socio-economic advancement of itspeople. But harnessing the power of ICTs does notbenefit only a few. In the end  it is a win-winproposition for us all — for developing and developedcountries alike. The responsible use and effectivedissemination of meaningful information is the key toemancipation from human ignorance and is thereforeessential to socio-economic progress. It follows thatthe means of collecting  evaluating  and transmittinginformation must be shared and placed at the service ofhumankind. It is for that reason that my countrycontinues to add its voice to those of other countries inurging universal cooperation in the WSIS process. It isa step forward along the road to achieving the MDGs.Without it  the MDGs will mean little.It is for the same reason that my Governmentsupports the Community of Democracies andparticipates in its activities. In our view 22democratization of the institutions of governance andtransparency in public policymaking — with dueregard to local conditions — are inseparable fromeconomic progress and collective security. After all the work of the Community does not contradict butfurther reinforces the MDGs and  in a larger sense  thetime-honoured objectives incorporated in the Charterof the United Nations.It does not take a great deal of wisdom to realizethat  as a small island developing State  my country isvulnerable to the extremely adverse impact of globalclimate change. For the 15 years we have been aMember of the United Nations  we have been vocalhere and elsewhere on the issue of climate change andits adverse impact on small island developing States.For us  it is an issue of security and survival. I reiterateour appeal to those countries that have not yet ratifiedthe Kyoto Protocol to do so immediately and withoutfurther delay.A week ago during the High-level PlenaryMeeting  President Joseph Urusemal  like otherMicronesian Presidents before him  called attention tothe daunting challenges facing our country and othersmall island developing States in pursuing sustainabledevelopment and achieving the MDGs. I reaffirm theircalls here once again  and stress the urgent need for theinternational community to fully and effectivelyimplement the Mauritius Strategy for the furtherImplementation of the Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates. The Strategy provides a way forward for thesecountries and plays a crucial role in our ability toachieve sustainable development and meet the MDGs.As if the plethora of challenges I have spoken ofare not daunting enough for my country  the escalatingcost of fuel and its negative impact on our efforts tomeet development goals and pursue sustainabledevelopment is a major cause of concern. That crisisbrings to the fore the need identified by small islanddeveloping States for accelerated research anddevelopment and a sharing of technologies in the areasof renewable and alternative sources of energy. Weappeal to the international community to assist us inthose areas.I take this opportunity today to reiterate the callmade by my President during the High-level PlenaryMeeting to further strengthen cooperation and linkagesbetween the United Nations and countries of thePacific  like mine. The need for the physical presenceof the United Nations system and its sustainedengagement in our development process is now morecompelling than ever. We cannot accept the notion thatour country is undeserving of the substantive presenceof the United Nations.Over the past few months we have seenencouraging signs in the Middle East. The historicdisengagement of Israel from the Gaza Strip and partsof the West Bank is a step in the right direction andshould be commended. My Government appreciates thepolitical obstacles faced by the two parties andencourages them to stay the course towards a peacefulsettlement of what has been a long  complex andunpleasant experience. We call upon both parties tospare no effort to actively pursue peaceful negotiations.They should not be satisfied until the day comes whenIsraeli and Palestinian children can play side by sideand live in peace  without fear.As a young country that graduated from thetrusteeship regime of this Organization  my countryplaces high hopes in the United Nations. At 60  theUnited Nations should not to be contemplatingretirement. Instead  the time has come for this greatOrganization to strengthen and rededicate itself inorder to effectively and efficiently meet the challengesof the new millennium."
"59",2500,"GAB",60,2005,"Mr. President  your election to the presidency of thissession of the General Assembly is indisputably anhistoric moment  which Gabon appreciates fully  sinceyour country has succeeded Gabon in this post. Thus  Ishould like to congratulate you most warmly on behalfof my delegation and assure you of Gabon’s supportthroughout your term. I should also like to express mygratitude to the Secretary-General for his immense bold and tireless actions in favour of the reinvigorationand the restoration of the prestige of the UnitedNations system. Allow me also to pay well-deservedtribute to the President of the fifty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly  His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping Minister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs Cooperation and Francophonie of the Republic ofGabon  for his outstanding contribution to the reformof our Organization.The important document adopted last Friday bythe High-level Meeting testifies to this reform effort. Itherefore welcome the fact that you have invited us tofocus our debate on the follow-up to the measuresadopted by the world leaders last week.Today  60 years after its creation  the UnitedNations has stood the test of time. The dysfunctionsnoted recently highlight the need to press ahead withessential institutional reform. In that connection  acomment by Montesquieu comes to mind and I quote “When a good thing has disadvantages  it is better todo away with the disadvantages than with the thingitself.” The author of The Spirit of Laws wassuggesting that we need to make a distinction betweenideals and human endeavour.More than an end in itself  the reform processmust  whenever necessary  make it possible to adaptthe United Nations to the demands of the times and tothe many complex mandates entrusted to it. In thiscontext  we should pay particular attention to theGeneral Assembly. It is the most representative forumof the international community  a site par excellencefor cooperation  for negotiation and for sharingresponsibilities.The United Nations is the seat of legitimacy andmoral authority at the international level and itparticipates in the ideal of shared destinies of nationsand the peoples of the world. This is why Gabonreiterates yet again its support for initiatives aimed at aconsensus-based reform of the Security Council  as theCouncil’s expansion should derive from the dual needfor representativity and effectiveness.Once reformed  the United Nations can dealbetter with the many challenges facing humankindtoday  such as HIV/AIDS  environmental degradation terrorism  armed conflicts and poverty. The HIV/AIDSpandemic  which affects rich and poor nations alikewithout distinction  is a serious threat to sparsely-populated countries such as Gabon. More than ever developing countries call upon the internationalcommunity to display effective and active solidarity inorder to limit the worst effects of this pandemic.Since vaccine experiments have not yet beenconclusive  and the therapeutic trials are stillinsufficient  efforts must be focused on prevention andon access to antiretroviral drugs in accordance with theagreement concluded within the context of the WorldTrade Organization. Gabon itself has taken solidinitiatives  ranging from awareness campaigns to theimplementation of action plans such as themultisectoral strategic plan to combat AIDS  in whichthe First Lady of Gabon  Madame Edith Lucie BongoOndimba  is personally involved. We welcome the factthat the final document of the High-level Meetingreaffirmed the commitment of the internationalcommunity to fight HIV-AIDS  malaria  tuberculosisand other infectious diseases.It is undeniable that the global challenges arenumerous and interdependent. Environmentaldegradation has become one of the main threats to lifeon earth. The consequences of climate change causedby human activity are at the root of natural disastersthat are unprecedented in scale. The future ofgenerations to come is thus compromised. It is in thiscontext that the concept of sustainable development which means in fact intergenerational solidarity  mustbe made systematic  so as to underlie both public andprivate policies.27Certainly  the Stockholm conference in 1972 thatled to the establishment of the United NationsEnvironment Programme  the Rio Conference onEnvironment and Development in 1992 and theJohannesburg Conference in 2002 were importantstages in the growing awareness of the internationalcommunity. But  we can and must do better. TheFrench proposal aimed at creating a United Nationsorganization for the environment  in addition toexisting mechanisms  seems to us in this respect verytimely. We should ensure follow-up to this idea  asproposed by the final document of the High-levelMeeting. Likewise  following an integrated approach we support the actions taken by the InternationalOrganization of la Francophonie to promote theenvironment and sustainable development. The mostrecent Summit of Heads of State of la Francophonie which was held in Ouagadougou from 26 to27 November 2004  adopted a document along theselines entitled “A strategic ten-year framework forbiodiversity and the protection of the environmentthroughout the francophone area”.The common heritage of the environment must bethe subject of more ambitious and more generousinternational cooperation that seeks to reduce the gapbetween two sets of partners that often havecontradictory expectations  that is  on the one hand  thedeveloped countries  and  on the other  the developingcountries.What can we say about terrorism  that tentacledcreature  that inscrutable threat  whose ubiquity evadesvigilance and even punitive measures? Friendlycountries have recently endured tragic experiences  andothers  unfortunately  have them nearly every day. Ithas to be said that on 11 September 2001 terrorismsounded the death knell for any feeling of safety.One of the notable points of the final documentsof the High-level Meeting of last week is the firm andunambiguous condemnation of terrorism in all itsforms and manifestations. This is notable progress thatwill  I am sure  facilitate the efforts of the internationalcommunity aimed at adopting a comprehensiveconvention on international terrorism  a task on whichthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly mustfocus and to which it must devote itself.Wishing to support the efforts of the internationalcommunity to stem this scourge  the Head of State ofGabon has just signed the International Convention forthe Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. “Peacewithin  peace with others and peace amongst others” isa tradition on which Gabon prides itself  a traditionthat reflects the purposes and principles of the Charterof the United Nations.At the beginning of the third millennium  manyAfrican countries were still in the grip of instabilityand armed conflicts. To find a way out of that impasseand steer towards a more stable and prosperous Africa African heads of State and Government set upmechanisms within the African Union such as thePeace and Security Council  which seeks to managepolitical crises and intra-State conflicts. The objectiveof the African States is to equip themselves with themeans to ensure their own security. It is clear thatregional mechanisms cannot manage indefinitelywithout bilateral agreements  multilateral cooperationand other relevant alliances. In this respect  allow meto commend the active role taken by the UnitedNations in maintaining peace in Africa  particularly inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  Côte d’Ivoireand the Sudan.We also note with satisfaction NATO’swillingness to accept the unprecedented invitation ofthe African Union  made by the Chairman of theCommission  Alpha Oumar Konaré.Allow me also to stress here the role played byGabon in all of these peace processes  which haveresulted in a gradual improvement in the securitysituation on the continent. The President of theRepublic of Gabon  El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba has been fully involved  along with his African peers in the resolution of African crises — consistentlyoffering his good offices and mediation serviceswhenever requested.Given the current situation in the Sudan  with thetragic death of the Vice-President  John Garang  theinternational community as a whole must ensure thatthe ceasefire agreement signed in January 2005holds — a necessary condition for the consolidation ofpeace and peacebuilding. I call on the partiesconcerned to respect their commitments in order thatthe peace process now under way may be concluded.With respect to Central Africa  we welcome therelative calm seen in countries that were recently incrisis  particularly in the Central African Republic Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ishould like here to welcome the conclusion of the28electoral process in Burundi and to express thanks forthe contribution made by the United Nations  theAfrican Union and South Africa.Gabon  which made its own modest contributionto the process  humbly encourages all of the newleaders to display political clear-sightedness andtolerance  with a view to the achievement of lastingpeace. Their decision to create a PeacebuildingCommission will no doubt help to enhance the UnitedNations peacekeeping machinery.As regards the economy  I need hardly recall thatdebt represents a major handicap for our countries.Indeed  nearly a third of our financial resources aredevoted to debt servicing. Thus once again we woulddraw the attention of the international community tothe specific situation involving the indebtedness ofmiddle-income countries like Gabon.Indeed  Gabon remains the only country in sub-Saharan Africa classified as a high-level middle-income country  thus making it ineligible for theHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) DebtInitiative  despite the political and economic reformsunder way for more than a decade. The current surge inthe price of oil — our State’s main budget resource —further fuels the illusion of a monetary surplus anddoes not really help us in the area of developmentfinancing  since the oil bonus basically goes to serviceexternal debt.It is true that at the Gleneagles  United Kingdom summit last July  endorsing the London Declaration of11 June 2005  the G-8 countries and other donorsundertook important commitments. Gabon  for its part would like to see those commitments translated intoaction  so as to increase the likelihood of achieving theMillennium Development Goals  to which my countryis particularly committed.I also welcome the fact that the summit’s finaldocument recognized the urgent need to redoubleefforts to achieve development objectives agreed at theinternational level  including the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.In conclusion  I should like to express the hopethat the work of the General Assembly at its sixtiethsession will be crowned with success  so that togetherwe can work to bring about a community of peoplesand nations living in peace  security and stability. MayGod inspire our work."
"60",2547,"GBR",60,2005,"Let me begin  Sir by paying tribute to your predecessor  Jean Ping  forhis extraordinary work — above all on the worldsummit  but also throughout his year as President —and by offering my congratulations to you onbeginning your year in office.I should also like to express  on behalf of theEuropean Union and all its member States  our deepestsympathy and solidarity to the people of the United27States  particularly those in the Gulf states  in theirhour of need.In early July  my first duty in the presidency ofthe European Union was to go to Srebrenica to markthe tenth anniversary of the massacre there  the worstin Europe since the end of the Second World War.More than 8 000 people  mainly Muslim  were takenaway and killed as the international community juststood to one side. To be sure  we had shown the rightconvictions in words  but shamefully  we had failed toact. The lesson of that massacre — and of the evengreater horror of Rwanda a year before — was that weall needed better means to turn our collective will intodecisive action. I think that we in the European Unionhave learned in the intervening period. Today  theUnion is on the ground as a military  police or civilianpresence in Bosnia  in Aceh  in Iraq  in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and  with the African Union  inDarfur.I also think that the United Nations has learnedthe lessons of the past decade. At the summit thisweek  we agreed on the further steps that we need totake for the Organization to be even more effective. Ofall that was agreed at the summit  I believe it will bethe agreement on our “responsibility to protect” thatwill be seen in the future as having the greatestsignificance of all. If we follow through on theresponsibility to protect  then never again willgenocide  ethnic cleansing and crimes againsthumanity be allowed to take place under our noseswith nothing done.The responsibility to protect is  of course  areflection of our common morality. But it is also arecognition that the world in which we now live is toosmall for us to be unaffected by  or indifferent to  theinnocent victims of murder and oppression. Thisshrinking of the world has been as sudden as it hasbeen profound. When the Berlin wall fell  a generationof ideological certainties was swept away. People couldsuddenly see partners where before they had onlyglimpsed adversaries. And as that very visible barrierwas noisily being breached  a revolution in informationtechnology was quietly erasing the barriers of distanceand time. Continents and cultures are now cabledtogether and bound by trade and services in a way thatwas unimaginable even a decade ago.In this new world  we can no longer safelytolerate the general threat that can come from aparticular human tragedy  wherever it takes place. To agreater extent than ever before  we share the sameworld: the same threats and responsibilities  the sameopportunities and interests. And precisely because theboundaries of our world have contracted  thehorizons — the ambitions — of many people aroundthe globe have infinitely expanded. For the first time inour history  mankind has the ability to realize thepotential of individuals in societies of all kinds and inevery region through an open exchange of goods investment  technology and  above all  ideas.Not least in all of this  it is the rise of India andof China that is reordering the world economy.Hundreds of millions there and elsewhere have beenlifted out of poverty. A new global market has beencreated that ignores the divide — which seemed sofundamental for so many decades — between East andWest.Currently  not everyone has the chance to share inall of that. Much of sub-Saharan Africa remainsblighted by poverty  disease and conflict. TheEuropean Union has now set a clear timetable toachieve the 0.7 per cent target for aid. Debt relief  tradereform and development aid are all vital  but none ofthem can work alone. Fundamental to making povertyhistory are the Governments of the developing worldthemselves. And where Governments fail  their ownpeoples are the victims  as United Nations SpecialEnvoy Anna Tibaijuka’s damning assessment of thesituation in Zimbabwe only too graphically shows.Sub-Saharan Africa is not alone in having yet toachieve its potential. The American author ThomasFriedman  in his recent book The World Is Flat highlights an extraordinary anomaly: it was the Arabpeoples whose forebears devised algebra and thealgorithms upon which our entire digital age is based but those peoples are now right at the rear of today’stechnological revolution  with  for example  fewer than2 per cent of those populations having Internet access.Three United Nations Development Programme ArabHuman Development Reports have now set out clearlyhow limited economic prospects and stunted politicalfreedoms have led young and talented people towardsalienation and disillusionment.The answer  however  does not lie in easystereotypes about some clash of civilizations. It is onlythe terrorists and the preachers of hate who want us tobelieve that Islam and the West are fundamentally28different. Theirs is a philosophy of mistrust anddespair  and we reject it utterly. Indonesia andTurkey — to name just two — are both strikingexamples of how countries with predominantly Muslimpopulations can embrace democracy and modernity.We in the European Union have seen the vibrantMuslim communities in our own countries  and fromthat experience have seen how Islamic and Westerncultures can be partners in a global society.Everyone knows that the Arab peoples wantprosperity  freedom and democracy every bit as muchas anyone in Europe or America. So the fact that theArab world has the lowest scores in regionalmeasurements of democratic practices  civil freedomsand good governance is not some cultural inevitability but a temporary failure of human will. In that regard the international community has a clear responsibilityto encourage regionally led political  social andeconomic reform. The European Union stronglysupports such reform and will continue to do so.Equally  it has been our active foreign policy that hasplaced us in the lead with regard to Iran  especially onthe nuclear dossier.With our High Representative Javier Solana andmy French and German Foreign Minister colleagues we have made detailed proposals for the relationshipbetween the European Union and Iran to be based oncooperation and respect for international norms andtreaties.Our proposals envisage a high-level  long-termpolitical and security framework between the EuropeanUnion and Iran  in which we would work together inpolitical  economic  scientific and technological areas including the civil nuclear field  in return for Iranproviding guarantees about its intentions andcapabilities concerning nuclear weapons. So  we willlisten very carefully to and reflect on this afternoon’sspeech by the new President of the Islamic Republic ofIran  Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.On Iraq  the European Union now has acomprehensive programme of engagement and has putbehind it divisions over the military action two and ahalf years ago. We are supporting the goal of apeaceful  prosperous  democratic and stable nation.We are also giving very active support to theQuartet’s efforts to secure a just and lasting peacebetween Israel and the Palestinians  with two Statesliving side by side. We salute Prime Minister Sharon’sbrave decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip  andwe salute President Mahmoud Abbas’s work to buildthe first stage of an effective  viable State of Palestine.In July  the European Union again suffered thehorror of a major terrorist atrocity. This time the targetwas my country  the United Kingdom: its capital London. But none of us is safe from the threat of terror.International terrorism requires an internationalresponse; otherwise  we all pay the price for eachother’s vulnerabilities. The ratification of acomprehensive treaty on terrorism is  therefore  at thehighest priority.But the threat from terrorists and the politicalinstability they bring is made worse by the easyavailability of weapons in what has become ananarchic  unregulated international trade. These sameweapons fuelled the killings in Rwanda and in Bosnia adecade ago and are fuelling the conflicts in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Darfur today.We already have international instruments to regulatechemical  biological and nuclear weapons. We in theEuropean Union have a comprehensive arms controlregime. But I suggest to the General Assembly that thetime has now come for this Organization to embracethe idea of an international arms trade treaty  whichwould build on and strengthen existing initiatives.It was in the killing fields of Europe  in twosuccessive wars  that the twin ideas of the UnitedNations and of the European Union became imperative.Today  the European Union’s commitment to theUnited Nations is profound; it has never been stronger.And it is reflected in what we give in voluntarydonations and to the regular budget and peacekeepingoperations.The fundamental purpose of the United Nationsremains today what it was at its foundation: to removethe scourge of war  to reaffirm the worth of the humanperson and to promote social progress and betterstandards of life. In this changed and changing world it is the responsibility of us all to ensure that thisOrganization has the powers and the resources toachieve all these aims."
"61",2571,"GEO",60,2005,"I should first like to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson onhis election as President at the sixtieth session of theGeneral Assembly. I assure him of my delegation’s fullsupport for the important work to be accomplished atthis session. I would also like to extend my gratitude toHis Excellency Mr. Jean Ping for his tireless effortsand vision for change he has demonstrated so amplyduring his presidency.(spoke in English)Our Organization is now at a turning point in itshistory. Sixty years after its founding  having confrontedmany challenges  faced many threats  been defied by somany conflicts  the United Nations is now entering thetwenty-first century with the obligation to reform itself.The bipolar world has come to an end  and newthreats of a global nature have emerged: internationalterrorism  conflicts of a different breed  developmentand global environmental challenges. I want here torenew to the delegation of the United States ofAmerica a message of solidarity from the Georgianpeople in the face of the New Orleans tragedy. OurOrganization has no other choice but to adapt  to findnew instruments and to establish a renewed credibility which can only be based on a proven efficiency  resultsand visible effects. Words do not suffice; deeds areexpected from us all.31We consider the outcome document adopted bythe 2005 High-level Plenary Meeting as a substantialstep in the right direction. This document deals with allthe real issues that  as we all know  are going to definetomorrow’s world and affect our Organization’s fate.Whether we are talking about eradication ofpoverty  consolidation of peace and security  protectionof human rights  protection of displaced persons  needfor an effective system of peacekeeping and for acoherent approach to peacebuilding  negative effects oftransnational crime  responsibility to protectpopulations from ethnic cleansing or whether wereaffirm the absolute necessity of a dialogue amongcultures and civilizations  all these challenges are ofdirect relevance for my country.For Georgia  these threats are not words  theseills are not theory  they are daily realities and directlyexperienced tragedies. Our support for an effectivereform is not a rhetorical stand. Our vital interests areat stake; the future of my country is at stake. Georgia isdirectly experimenting on its soil the consequences ofso-called frozen conflicts. Frozen conflicts lead to thefreezing of the economic development of theseseparatist regions. They freeze the democraticdevelopment of the society in those regions. Theyisolate them and close them  transforming them intooutlaws  “black holes” where all kinds of traffickingand criminal activities  possibly including terroristactivities  could develop outside our control or anyform of control  outside any law.Frozen conflicts  as well as active conflicts  callfor the development of a real capacity of the UnitedNations for effective involvement through instrumentsof peacebuilding. For many years the United Nationshas been dealing with the Abkhazian conflict  butunfortunately it has not managed to obtain effectiveresults. It has proved unable to this day to deploy thesmall police component that was decided upon  unableto implement fully its own resolutions  unable todeploy an effective peacekeeping capability  unable tomonitor the human rights violations that are occurringdaily and frequently.Gradually  despite the United Nations  despiteregular meetings of the Security Council  and despitethe Secretary-General’s Group of Friends of Georgia  aregime of apartheid prevails under which Georgians areexcluded and forbidden to go back to their land andtheir homes  and a process of covert annexation istaking place. Thus  Abkhazia will be a litmus test ofthe renewed efficiency of our Organization  of itscapacity to monitor effectively  to managepeacekeeping operations without having to delegate itsresponsibilities to third parties and to enact finallystrategies of effective peacebuilding.In the case of the South Ossetian conflict inGeorgia  we have a similar situation. The President ofGeorgia has presented two mutually reinforcing peaceproposals within a year. One proposal introduced lastyear before this Assembly set out the three phases forending the conflict: demilitarization  economicrehabilitation and political dialogue. In December2004  it was complemented by a full-fledged proposalon a status of broad autonomy  prepared together withthe Council of Europe’s Commission for Democracythrough Law (the Venice Commission) and presentedto the Council of Europe. But peace plans are notenough. We now need a mechanism through which theinternational community will effectively supportinitiatives and policies that are directed towardspeaceful resolution of conflicts.For all these reasons  we are taking the outlinesof the new document very seriously and want to see itfully developed and implemented. We welcome andsupport the creation of an initial operating capabilityfor a standing police capacity. This is a very right stepin the very right direction. We welcome the creation ofa Human Rights Council. This new body should bemore representative  should comply with the higheststandards of objectivity and should avoid doublestandards as well as omissions or silences. An effectivemonitoring system should be put into place. Thestrengthening of the Office of the Commissioner forHuman Rights is also a step in the right direction.We welcome the creation of a PeacebuildingCommission that will develop integrated strategies forpost-conflict rehabilitation and recovery. We also needa more effective framework for moving smoothly frompeacemaking to peacebuilding  while developing anall-inclusive and coherent strategy within which theUnited Nations will fully assume its responsibilities.The new Peacebuilding Commission should be fullyrepresentative of the countries that have been or are themost directly affected by conflicts. Also  given thespecial fate of women and children in conflict andpost-conflict situations  gender representation shouldbe given additional attention. “Representation isessential”  “Knowledge is key” — as we  female foreign32ministers  have mentioned in our letter to the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly.Finally  Georgia supports the reform andrevitalization of the Security Council — a moreeffective and efficient  more democratic  moretransparent body is called for. Georgia supports theenlargement proposals in order to give non-permanentmembers a better chance to contribute to majordecisions. Transparency and improved decision-makingprocedures are a must. Georgia is convinced that ifthere is an adequate political will  the relevantagreement on a reformed Security Council can bereached at the present session of the General Assembly.This is our wish. Moreover  this is a necessity. Ourcredibility is at stake.Today not only the United Nations but all themajor international organizations are going through adifficult process of adjustment  of renewal andreappraisal. That is the case of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe  the EuropeanUnion  the Council of Europe and the Commonwealthof Independent States. Some will survive and growstronger. Some will have to yield ground to otherforums that are more flexible  less bureaucratic andmore in line with today’s realities.The United Nations has today started aninvaluable process of readjustment and rejuvenation. Ifour work is successful  this process will go to its term.The United Nations will cease to be a mere forumfor calling for peaceful solutions; it will become theinstrument the world needs  the instrument forresolving the conflicts that tarnish the image of today’sglobal world  the instrument for effectively respondingto the newer global threats that endanger ourdevelopment and our stability."
"62",2618,"GHA",60,2005,"After the celebratory andpowerful statements made here by leaders from all fourcorners of the world during these past few dayscommemorating the sixtieth anniversary of thisOrganization  all that is left for Ghana to do is toemphasize a few points in this annual general debate ofthe General Assembly.The record attendance of heads of State andGovernment at this year’s meetings is evidence that more and more  nations of the world are accepting andlooking up to the United Nations to provide the moraland practical framework and leadership for the shapingand governance of the onrushing global village.Without doubt  the Organization has become both themain centre for the mobilization and deployment ofresources for the relief of victims of natural and man-made disasters alike  and also the chief agency andcatalyst for the spread of opportunities for progress anddevelopment for all humankind. Reassuringly  it isgalvanizing the conscience of humankind to resist anddesist from inhuman conduct  whilst putting in place aglobal social safety net for the poor  the weak and thehandicapped in a world of strident competition.Ghana will therefore continue to contribute to theongoing debate on United Nations reform  especiallythe strengthening of the Organization’s institutions atall levels. The reforms must radiate the spirit ofcommon humanity in which each person is hisbrother’s keeper. That will engender the trust needed toanchor the tolerance and goodwill which must be thecornerstone of the globalization process.The increasing realization of our commonhumanity will lessen the divisive tendencies of racial religious  political  gender  cultural and other socialcategorizations. Already  the world  under theleadership of this Organization  is doing well in itsmany dramatic rallies in rushing aid to victimswherever disaster occurs  such as the Indian OceanStates after the tsunami and the aftermath of HurricaneKatrina in New Orleans  here in the United States ofAmerica.In spite of those positive developments  however the persistent and worsening carnage and mayhemcaused by terrorism still seem to lurk everywhere.Nowhere and nobody seems to be safe any longer.Whatever its cause  terrorism cannot be justified orrationalized in terms of a solution  since its effects donot discriminate between the perceived guilty and theinnocent. That is why the world must stand togetherand try to eradicate it.African nations are now showing a strongdetermination to end the conflicts that have bedevilledthe continent for decades. The setting-up of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) andthe African Peace and Security Council under theauspices of the African Union is a demonstration ofthat resolve. Through NEPAD  Africa has identified thefactors of good governance  the culture of democracy the rule of law  free and fair elections  sound economicmanagement of States  and State support for andpartnership with the private sector as critical forsustained socio-economic development  peace andstability.For accelerated economic growth  Africa isgenerally agreed that the way forward is throughpartnerships among the African nations and with therest of the world to create economies of scale and toattract both domestic and foreign direct investment.That will create opportunities for employment  thetransfer of know-how and markets to combat thedebilitating poverty. The world community mustsupport Africa in those ground-breaking efforts.Africa believes that the realization of the agendaunder the Doha Round could also bring significantbenefits to developing countries. But alongside thoseefforts must come support for the call for greatlyenhanced economic aid from the United Nations andthe developed world for the struggling third world tonurture itself into the fitness required for thecompetitiveness that the global market demands. Thesame rationale must back the various initiatives aimedat providing assistance for the prevention  care andtreatment of HIV/AIDS  malaria and other infectiousdiseases. It is only by containing those diseases that thecontinent’s development can be kept on course.The empowerment of women and children ismoving apace on the continent. In that regard  Ghanahas established a Ministry of Women’s and Children’sAffairs to spearhead policies and programmes topromote gender equality and enhance the status ofwomen.This is a historic moment of truth for theinternational community. The destiny of the United18Nations and humankind is in our hands. We have thechoice to save it  and the time to act is now."
"63",2664,"GIN",60,2005,"Allow me at the outset  on behalf of my delegation warmly to congratulate Mr. Eliasson on his outstandingelection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits sixtieth session. My country  Guinea  assures him ofits full cooperation as he carries out his importantmission.I also pay well-deserved tribute to hispredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  for the competence effectiveness and devotion with which he led the workof the fifty-ninth session.I am also pleased to convey to Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan the deep appreciation  encouragement andsupport of Mr. Lansana Conté  President of theRepublic  for his tireless and praiseworthy work.The summit meeting at this session of the GeneralAssembly has substantially stiffened our commonresolve to promote international peace and security  therule of law and the right to development. The23assessment of the implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and the renewed commitment ofStates Members to achieving them are cause for hope.The Republic of Guinea nevertheless remainsconvinced that if we are better to meet the threats andchallenges we face  we must resolutely pursue thereforms necessary to revitalize our Organization.In the name of peace and security  the concertedand decisive action of the United Nations system andof regional and subregional organizations  the AfricanUnion in particular  has made significant progress inrecent months.In West Africa  and especially in the Mano Riverbasin  hopes for peace are gradually growing afteryears of turbulence and tragedy.In Liberia  the political and institutional rebirthunder way is encouraging  although many obstaclesstill hinder national reconciliation and the country’seconomic revival. It is essential that  in order topreserve their legitimacy and fairness  we doeverything possible to prevent October’s elections frombeing manipulated by the forces of destabilization. Wetherefore call on the international community to givethat country the assistance necessary to seeing thetransition through and launching its ownreconstruction.In Sierra Leone  the process of nationalreconciliation is continuing  thereby promotingpeacebuilding and development. My delegationbelieves that adequate financing for the Special Courtfor Sierra Leone and the transfer of all personspresumed guilty of serious crimes under internationallaw are prerequisites for putting an end to impunity andconsolidate subregional stability.As concerns Guinea-Bissau  my countrywelcomes the smooth holding of the presidentialelections  which herald a positive new era that will beconducive to national reconciliation and a return toconstitutional order.In Côte d’Ivoire  the signing of the PretoriaAgreement on 6 April 2005 has given rise to real hopesthat the crisis can be resolved. However  recentdevelopments are a source of concern to us. OurGovernment calls on all parties concerned to spare noeffort to promote a political settlement of the conflict since peace and stability in the subregion hinge on this.In Burundi  major progress has been made in thepeace process  particularly through the holding oflegislative and presidential elections in free  fair andpeaceful conditions. Guinea welcomes this and calls onour brothers in Burundi to continue on the path tonational reconciliation and reconstruction.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  wherethe transitional period is at a decisive stage  problemspersist in the eastern part of the country. My countryencourages all parties to abide by the relevantprovisions of the comprehensive agreement.In the Sudan  despite the sad death of Vice-President Garang  the establishment of a national unityGovernment and the political will shown by the variousprotagonists will help to defuse tensions.Guinea urges all parties in Darfur to pursue thenegotiations that have begun under the auspices of theAfrican Union with a view to achieving acomprehensive  consensus-based solution.In the Horn of Africa  Somalia has reached adecisive stage with the creation of a TransitionalFederal Government. My delegation makes an urgentappeal to the various factions to engage in negotiationswith the Government in order to reach acomprehensive peace agreement.Regarding the Ethiopia-Eritrea dispute  we callon both parties fully to respect the Algiers Accord andto implement the Boundary Commission’s decision.As to the situation in the Western Sahara  Guineasupports a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution.It encourages the parties concerned to enhance theircooperation with the Special Representative of theSecretary-General.Concerning the Middle East  our Governmentwelcomes Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.However  we remain concerned by the occupation ofthe West Bank  the continued illegal construction of theseparation wall and the continuing detention ofPalestinian political prisoners.That is why we appeal to the two parties torespect the relevant resolutions of the GeneralAssembly and of the Security Council  as well as theQuartet road map. This is the only way to bring aboutthe creation of two States — Palestine and Israel —living side by side in safety and security within secureand recognized boundaries.24In Iraq  despite the holding of legislativeelections that led to the establishment of a transitionalGovernment  we cannot but deplore the current climateof daily violence. We agree that everything should bedone to help the country’s leaders to consolidate thepolitical transition  put an end to indiscriminateviolence and build a united  democratic and prosperousIraq.With regard to Asia  our Government reaffirms itsbelief in the principle of one China. We also attachimportance to the peaceful and independentreunification of the two Koreas as well as to ongoingefforts to maintain peace  security and stability on theKorean peninsula.My delegation notes with profound concern theresurgence of terrorist activities throughout the world.We strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and inall its manifestations  for it constitutes one of the mostserious threats to international peace and security. Weexpress solidarity with all States that have fallen victimto it.To eradicate that scourge  my delegationreaffirms the need to tackle with determination its rootcauses  including injustice  exclusion  poverty and theintensification of social divisions.We welcome the adoption by the Assembly on13 April 2005 of the resolution on the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of Acts of NuclearTerrorism  and we urge Member States to reachagreement on a comprehensive convention onterrorism.The seventh Review Conference of the Parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons and the Second Biennial Meeting of States toConsider the Implementation of the Programme ofAction to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the IllicitTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All ItsAspects  which were held  respectively  in May andJuly 2005  shows the concern of States parties to domore to address disarmament-related problems.However  we note and deplore the fact that theStates parties to the Treaty have not yet succeeded inreaching consensus on questions of substance. Hencewe urge all States to continue negotiations in order tostrengthen the international non-proliferation regime.With regard to combating the proliferation andillicit trade in small arms and light weapons  Guineahas resolutely undertaken to eradicate that scourge andwelcomes the adoption of a draft instrument for thetracing of such weapons.We invite the donor community to provideappropriate support for the implementation of thesubregional programme of the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS). The initiative totransform the ECOWAS moratorium into a bindinglegal instrument merits due consideration by MemberStates.Aware of the importance that peoples attach todevelopment goals  of the latter’s interdependence andof what is at stake  the Government of Guinea hasadopted a national poverty-reduction strategy whoseimplementation has  regrettably  been compromised byexternal factors linked to rebel attacks  a massiveinflux of refugees and regional instability.My delegation appeals urgently to alldevelopment partners to support Guinea in its efforts toimplement that strategy  which remains the mostcertain way of achieving the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. In that connection  we welcome the recentprogress made in the framework of poverty reduction particularly the commitment of the G-8 to doubleofficial development assistance (ODA) over the nextfew years and immediate debt cancellation for the 18most indebted poor countries. We commend andendorse all other initiatives designed to increase fundsfor ODA. We express the hope that the Gleneaglesinitiative  which represents an important step forwardin the right direction  will be translated into reality andwill be extended to all least developed countries.Furthermore  in the context of the current WorldTrade Organization trade negotiations  we urgeMember States to show a spirit of compromise anddiligence in order to overcome their differences andcome to an understanding on a consensus programmefor the implementation of the Doha DevelopmentAgenda before the sixth Hong Kong MinisterialConference. What is at stake is the very future of themultilateral trading system.Our work is taking place following the High-levelPlenary Meeting  as a consequence of which ourleaders have adopted an outcome document to guideour actions. The decisions and commitments taken atthe summit clearly indicate that a new era has begun.The time for promises has passed  and we must nowtranslate our commitments into concrete action in a25spirit of true solidarity between developed anddeveloping countries  on the basis of a far-reachingreform of our Organization.By so doing  we will leave to future generations to which we owe a debt  the right tools to leadhumankind towards a better future."
"64",2703,"GMB",60,2005,"Let me begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtiethsession. I have no doubt that  with your skills and vastexperience  you will guide our deliberations to asuccessful conclusion. Let me also commend my dearfriend His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping  the outgoingPresident of the General Assembly  for the excellentmanner in which he directed the affairs of the fifty-ninth session. In addition  I commend the Secretary-General for his leadership  especially in advancing theUnited Nations reform and revitalization agenda. Mycountry has full confidence in his integrity andcompetence  which he has demonstrated over the years both as a staff member and at the helm of theOrganization.As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of theOrganization  we must pause and take stock of therecord of our collective response to the many differentglobal challenges that mankind has had to face. From amembership of only 50 States at its inception  theOrganization has grown to 191 Members today. Thatrapid expansion  together with the sophistication thatthe United Nations has acquired over the years  callsfor an assessment of its strengths and weaknesses witha view to making it more effective. It is no secret thatthe voice of the General Assembly has grown weakerover the years  that the credibility of our human rightsprocedures and mechanisms has been reduced  thatdemocracy  accountability and transparency in theSecurity Council have become blurred and that theEconomic and Social Council needs to be morerelevant and effective.On several occasions since 1945  we havewitnessed instances of genocide  war crimes andcrimes against humanity  as well as the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. Civil strife and terrorismare undermining human and State security. Poverty hunger and diseases still decimate countlesscommunities  while our capacity to respond tohumanitarian crises needs to be reassessed andrevitalized.This is the backdrop of the challenges we as anorganization face. They do not represent failure; theysimply underscore that more needs to be done to makethe world a safer and better place for all of mankind.Therefore  as we celebrate our achievements  letus rededicate ourselves to remaining true to ourmission and also fashion a new vision that captures therealities of our world in the twenty-first century. In thisconnection  my delegation would like to express itsgratitude to the Secretary-General for thecomprehensive reform agenda he has laid out in hisreport “In larger freedom: towards development security and human rights for all” (A/59/2005). Weagree that the world needs to be steered towards agreater focus on those larger freedoms.The majority of the world’s people today are inchains — the chains of poverty and underdevelopment.5For them  development means freedom from want freedom from fear and hunger and  above all  freedomto live in dignity. Reforming the United Nations so thatit is better poised to more effectively addresshumankind’s quest for these larger freedoms  is a realnecessity for the greater relevance and impact of ourOrganization.Indeed  the following objectives should be ourcollective focus for the next decade: absolute povertyand its attendant woes such as diseases  hunger andilliteracy must be eliminated from the face of the earth;the proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of massdestruction must be halted and a total ban on nuclearweapons should be imposed on all States; peace mustbe allowed to reign throughout the world; there mustbe greater tolerance and mutual respect in dealing witheach other’s differences; the world’s ecosystems andnatural resources must be judiciously conserved andutilized; political systems must work to achieve greatercooperation; multilateralism should replace unilateralismin dealing with conflicts  disputes or disagreementsbetween Member States  and reconciliation shouldreplace confrontation and conflict.If  in the next decade  we succeed in achievingthose objectives  we will have provided for ourselvesthose larger freedoms that we crave today.While we must focus on those long-termobjectives  we must also not lose sight of theimperatives of our time. We must continue working inconcert towards the realization of global peace assigning highest priority to those conflict situationsthat pose the greatest threat to the peace of the wholeworld. In this  we must begin with the Middle East.Without a just solution to the Palestinian-Israeliconflict peace will continue to elude the Middle Eastwith consequences that will affect the whole world. Mydelegation supports the vision of a two-State solution with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peaceand security. We also welcome Israel’s withdrawalfrom Gaza and the West Bank as a step towards acomplete withdrawal from the rest of the occupiedPalestinian territory.The unstable situation in Iraq is causingundesirable ripples all over the world. The situation is by no means  unconnected with the soaring price of oil which is causing serious problems in the globaleconomy and threatening the economic gains made bymany developing countries. The sooner stability isbrought to the region  the better it will be for thatcountry and the rest of the world.We are encouraged by the positive contributionsof the United Nations and the African Union towardsthe peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa.In Guinea-Bissau  another milestone has beenreached with the election of President Nino Vieira.After many years of trials and tribulation  the people ofGuinea-Bissau have finally placed the country on asolid path to recovery  peace and development. AsChair of the Friends of Guinea-Bissau at the UnitedNations  as well as a member of the Ad hoc AdvisoryGroup on Guinea-Bissau  my delegation calls for anearly convening of a donors conference to showsolidarity with the people of Guinea-Bissau and acommitment to lasting peace in that country.Equally in Burundi  the democratic transition hasbeen completed with the recent election of PresidentPierre Nkurunziza. We extend to him and the people ofBurundi  our heartiest congratulations and best wishesfor a new era of peace  stability and development.This year has witnessed major strides towardssustainable peace in the Sudan. My delegationcommends the Government of the Sudan and theSudanese People’s Liberation Movement for theircommitment to that historic accord meant to bringlasting peace to the country. We are encouraged by thesteps they have taken so far to implement the accord and it is my fervent hope that their collectiveleadership will continue tirelessly to pursue the Sudanof their dreams. We sympathize with all the Sudanesepeople on the tragic death of their leader and Vice-President  Mr. John Garang  who did so much toadvance the peace process. We are confident that hissuccessor will continue in his footsteps until all thepending issues are peacefully resolved.An underlying factor in all of these conflicts isthe proliferation of small arms and light weapons. Wemust commit ourselves to denying non-State actors terrorists and organized criminal networks theacquisition of these weapons of mass terror. We shallhave an opportunity to further refine our response tothis scourge during the 2006 review of the UnitedNations Programme of Action on Small Arms.Our Organization must be the ultimate defenderof the rule of international law  to which all States inthe comity of nations must adhere. Any attempt to6weaken or undermine our rules-based internationalsystem should be rejected without compromise. Aninstitution like the International Criminal Court  with amandate to end impunity  deserves all the support itcan garner from the international community. TheRome Statute is a beacon of hope to all of humanity and my delegation appeals to those States that have notyet done so  to consider speedily becoming party to it.My delegation strongly condemns the applicationof unilateral coercive measures as a means of settlingdisputes. These measures have an adverse impact onthe lives of innocent people  who lack any means ofrecourse or redress. We therefore call for the completeand immediate lifting of the sanctions imposed on Cuba.As we clamour for reform and renewal of ourOrganization  we should widen our horizons andundertake a sober and dispassionate reassessment ofour policy towards the Republic of Taiwan. Theconcerns of the 23 million hard-working and peace-loving people of that great country continue to beignored. The Republic of Taiwan is a democratic sovereign State. Its democratically elected Governmentdefends the interests of the people of Taiwan in theworld. The Taiwanese people display the same concernwe all do about global problems such as internationalpeace and security  HIV/AIDS  the spread of disease environmental pollution  and all the other issues thatengage us at the United Nations. Yet  they are not hereat the table with us  contributing their share in thesearch for solutions to the problems that confronthumankind today. We therefore call on all the peace-loving nations of the world to support the participationof the Republic of Taiwan in all the affairs of theUnited Nations as a full Member without delay. Thetwenty-first-century United Nations should include allpeople the world over without political discrimination.The United Nations should also be committed to thatgoal: a twenty-first-century  reformed United Nationsthat includes the people of the Republic of Taiwan.Their plight is more sharply amplified by our presentpreoccupation with the conflicts raging today that posea serious threat to international peace and security.The reform agenda has been with us for decadesnow. Finally  this year  a number of reports  includingone by the Secretary-General himself  seem to havespurred all of us to action.My delegation fully supports the proposed reformof the Economic and Social Council and endorses theestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission. Inthat regard  we hope that the wealth of experiencewhich the United Nations has gathered over the years especially in dealing with countries emerging fromconflict  will be brought to bear in elaborating thestructure  functions and mandate of the Commission.We equally support the proposed reform of theCommission on Human Rights. However  we shouldremember that human rights are everyone’s concernand their enforcement is not the prerogative of a selectfew. A smaller human rights body would reinforce thatnotion and entrench the credibility crisis that thecurrent Commission suffers from. While theCommission may have structural deficiencies  it is itsworking methods that we must focus on in order toeliminate bias  subjectivity and selectivity.Revitalizing the General Assembly is equallylong overdue. It is time for the Assembly to be moreassertive within the mandate accorded it by the Charter.The reform of our Organization would beincomplete without Security Council reform. Thecurrent size and composition of the Council makes amockery of the larger membership of the UnitedNations and the realities of the world today. No amountof politics or procrastination can silence Africa’slegitimate quest for full representation on the SecurityCouncil. International peace and security areeveryone’s business. Without reform and a thoroughreview of the Council’s working methods  thelegitimacy of the decisions it takes will be increasinglyquestionable.We shall also have to look into the issue of theveto once again. The purpose for which the veto wasinstituted and the grounds on which it was assigned 60years ago are no longer valid in today’s world. In fact Africa’s position on the veto  which my delegationwholeheartedly supports  is that it should be abolished.In fact  veto power should be given only to the GeneralAssembly  to be exercised by a majority vote. If that isdone  the United Nations and the world will be able toboast of a universal democratic system that will usherin a new and more peaceful world order.The Security Council as presently constituted isnot conducive to the maintenance of world peace andsecurity. If it cannot be reformed  it should beabolished and its mandate assigned to the GeneralAssembly with decisions taken by a majority vote. Inthat event  any action taken by the United Nations in a7given situation would be taken on behalf of all of us.That would put a definitive end to unilateralism inresolving international disputes and issues."
"65",2743,"GNB",60,2005,"Allow me at the outset tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside overthe General Assembly at its sixtieth session. Givenyour role at this critical moment  Guinea-Bissau  in itscapacity as a Vice-President at this session  will spareno effort in supporting you in your work.I also extend my warmest congratulations to yourpredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  Minister of State andMinister for Foreign Affairs of the sisterly Republic ofGabon  on the commitment and skill he demonstratedduring his presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-ninth session.I also congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  on his excellent work at the head of ourOrganization to strengthen its credibility  promoteessential international solidarity  and achieve consensuson major issues relating to security  counter-terrorism development and human rights.The world awaits the dawn of a new order  whichwill require a more realistic and democratic internationalpolitical framework  global commitment  and thecollective will of all Member States to meet thechallenges facing humankind in the context ofincreasing interdependence. We endorse theconclusions and recommendations contained in theSecretary-General's report  and I reiterate my country'sreadiness to contribute to all global agreements thatwill allow us to meet the current challenges ofdevelopment  security  the fight against internationalterrorism  respect for human rights  and institutionalreform of the United Nations  in particular that of theSecurity Council  where Africa should enjoy thelegitimate right to hold two permanent seats.To carry out these reforms  it is important thatthere be political will  based on the collective action ofStates  which is the foundation of this internationalsystem. I cannot overemphasize the fact thatcooperation which could lead to this collective actionwill be possible only if the policies of our countriestake account of the needs of our own citizens  as wellas the needs of others  because we are part of the samehuman family  forced to live together on this sameplanet  and we have an obligation to share it andprotect it.In this regard  I would express my concern vis-a-vis the phenomenon of globalization. We are aware ofthe enormous potential and advantages of a well-managed globalization and all that it has to offer in theeconomic  financial  commercial  technological andcommunication fields. However  it is equallyimportant  at this stage of globalization  to recognizethat it has not been sufficiently inclusive. Exclusionand marginalization in international relations are thenegative effects of globalization. These are factors thatcontribute to the existence and proliferation of conflicts- situations which require properly-coordinated  globalresponses  as well as multilateral frameworks fordialogue  agreement and effective interaction.Inter-State conflict  civil wars  organized crime terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and the illicit trafficking in small arms andlight weapons are phenomena which threateninternational security. But such threats are not limitedsolely to these spheres. They also involve poverty pandemics and natural disasters affecting the planet.The growing link between security anddevelopment is proof that the gesture of solidaritydesired with regard to financing for development of thepoor is needed more than ever. This responsible and4positive attitude is one of the main pillars in our effortsto pursue the Millennium Development Goals  achallenge which mankind cannot fail to meet. I hopethat there will be sufficient political will so that thenew partnership for development which we wish to seeestablished among States in the very near future willdispel any doubts and fulfil the hopes raised during theinternationally-organized conferences within theframework of the United Nations in the economic financial and social and related spheres.The outcome document we have just adopted atthe conclusion of the recent High-level PlenaryMeeting is still insufficient  but it is forward-looking.We must underscore the fact that discussions agreements and negotiations need to be pursued in atransparent fashion in order to achieve desired resultsby all Member States.Africa has rightfully been the recent subject ofincreased attention on the part of the internationalcommunity. I am pleased to express our satisfaction atthe decision recently adopted at the Summit of the G-8regarding debt cancellation for some African countries and the possibility of extending this measure to otherpoor countries  including my country  Guinea-Bissau.On 1 October  Guinea-Bissau will continue andconclude the process of complete return toconstitutional normalcy through presidential elections.The success of this political transitional period thatbegan in September 2003 is the fruitful result ofbalanced relations among institutions of the Republic based on the separation of powers and characterized bygood governance.We must recognize that this has not always beeneasy  and quite often we have faced situations which gobeyond our national capacity to resolve. Theframework for constant cooperation and agreementwith the international community has been animportant instrument in following up the socio-economic situation and the political internal process.We wish to express our thanks to the Member States ofthe Economic Community of West African States  theEuropean Union  the international community andPortuguese-speaking countries for contributing to thepolitical transitional process in our country. Withoutthis support for Guinea-Bissau it would have beendifficult for us to face the numerous constraints duringthe transitional phase.The role played by the United Nations system -the Economic and Social Council's ad hoc group andthe Group of Friends of Guinea-Bissau in particular -deserves special mention and our most heartfelt thanks.The support of the international community hasbeen very important in the success of the transitionalperiod in Guinea-Bissau. However  more decisiveaction is required to meet the challenges ofreconstruction and the rebuilding of the infrastructurein my country  to improve the economy and createminimal conditions for governability and to strengthenthe foundation of a democratic State  which we wish tosee in Guinea-Bissau. These factors are essential forpeace and for political and social stability.Once again  I would call from this rostrum for thesupport of the international community in theNovember Donor Round-Table Conference withpartners in peace for development in order to adopttogether a document on the national strategy to reducepoverty. This goal is in line with the concerns of theUnited Nations aimed at more effective assistance tocountries in post-conflict situations  contained in theproposal to create a Peacebuilding Commission  whichwe fully support.We recognize respect for the rules of democracy for human rights and good economic and financialgovernance. We feel that they are the foundation forthe rule of law. We reaffirm the commitment of myGovernment  in strict compliance with our constitution to work in close cooperation with all institutions of theRepublic to create conditions aimed at promotingnational reconciliation  peace and domestic politicalstability  to consolidate our relations of friendship brotherhood and solidarity with our neighbours and torestore a climate of trust  credibility and effective lasting partnership with the entire internationalcommunity for socio-economic development in ourcountry."
"66",2782,"GNQ",60,2005,"The Republic of Equatorial Guinea isparticipating in this debate with hope and optimismthat we will see the United Nations systemstrengthened once again so that it can effectively carryout its mission as the centre of global equilibrium inorder to attain the objectives established at its creationin 1945.Indeed  the United Nations was created to defendand promote the rights of persons and the dignity freedom and equality of human beings. The UnitedNations was created to promote the equality of allnations  mutual respect  solidarity and the promotion ofcooperation among States on an equal footing and formutual benefit. Another of the objectives establishedwas to promote the global development of nationsthrough a just and equitable economic system thatwould protect the interests of all countries  rich orpoor.The United Nations must be given theinternational authority it needs to establish peace  orderand stability in the world  serving as a centre ofuniversal equilibrium with the capacity to resolveconflicts arising among States. Force must be usedonly in conformity with the provisions of the Charterof the United Nations  with the prior consent of itscompetent bodies  because the undue use of force candisrupt international peace and security in anunforeseeable manner.We hope that the United Nations system will bethe inspiration for a democratic culture and for humanrights  serving as a model and guide for the internalorganization of its Members. We therefore support thecreation of a Human Rights Council that will be veryclosely involved with human-rights-related issues ineach country and that will have relevant competenciesto support the affected countries with regard to thedecisions and recommendations of the Economic andSocial Council.The democratization of societies and goodgovernance are concepts universally accepted byStates. Therefore  there is no need to adopt coercivemechanisms against any State to ensure theirimplementation. All that is needed is to assist andguide each State as to how it should assimilatedemocratic concepts in accordance with its economic social and cultural realities.For all those reasons  we believe that  60 yearsafter the Organizationís founding  the social andpolitical circumstances that prevailed in 1945 have losttheir validity because of the very dynamics of thedevelopment of modern societies. Today  we are in thebest possible position to rethink the responsibilities ofthe United Nations and its Members in the light of theaforementioned objectives  bearing in mind todayíscircumstances and the experience accumulated in the60 years of its existence.We recognize that the task is very difficult andcomplex  taking into account the various interests thatconverge as we consider reforming the entire UnitedNations system. That is why we congratulate you Mr. President  on the confidence that the internationalcommunity has placed in you and in your Governmentto moderate this important debate. We hope that yourskill and professional experience will be put to gooduse so that we can attain our objectives.We believe that in this effort  we must givepriority to the spirit of democracy and the interests ofhumankind  because democracy  as the expression ofthe popular will  and compliance with consensualnorms both involve respect for the collective will. Wealso believe that the United Nations could not imposeorder and justice on a human community dominated bythe various cultural  economic and political interests ofits Member States without recourse to the democraticprinciples to which all of us are bound. In thatconnection  the Security Council  as the organ thatmust demand universal compliance with its decisions must be the first to act under democratic criteria.For my country  the needed reform of theSecurity Council does not involve an increase in itsmembership or  even less  an expansion of the right of30the veto. We must examine the reasons for the SecurityCouncilís failure since its creation in 1945. In fact  ifthere is something that should be done to reform theSecurity Council  it is to simply revoke the right of theveto enjoyed by some of its members as a concept thatwas created only because of the conflict between twoopposing ideological systems within the UnitedNations system. The veto has never allowed theconsensus or majority sovereign expression of theSecurity Council; it has served only as a way in whichto block the popular will so as to protect the interestsof the Power exercising the veto.In the present circumstances of a unipolar world we do not see the need to exercise the veto in thisUnited Nations body. Many just resolutions have beenvetoed despite the fact that they have sought thecommon good  and we have seen the negative results.If the veto must be maintained in the Security Councilbecause of interests  we ask that Africa also have thatright  because  like any other regional group  thatcontinent has many interests to defend.When the Security Council is democratized weask that its decisions be binding and that those who donot comply with them be properly sanctioned. Thiswould give teeth to its decisions. Non-compliance withthe principles and resolutions adopted by UnitedNations bodies creates impunity unless disciplinarymeasures are taken against those who are in breach ofthem.In this regard  Equatorial Guinea strongly regretsthe failure to take measures against the terrorists whotried to overthrow the established constitutionalGovernment on 6 March 2004 despite identification ofnationalities of the terrorists and despite EquatorialGuineaís request to the Governments concerned.The United Nations must clearly define thephenomenon of terrorism and in so doing avoidconfusion with what is interpreted as legitimate armedintervention. Humanitarian intervention cannot becarried out on the basis of an individual interpretation but rather must be justified by the competentinstitutions of the United Nations system.Questions related to organized transnationalcrime  such as terrorism and mercenary activities  mustbe the subject of a special session of the GeneralAssembly to deal with criminal acts such as those of11 September in New York  11 March in Madrid andevents in London  Russia  Morocco  Tanzania  Kenyaand the mercenary attack in Equatorial Guinea and toadopt measures that can avert the loss of innocent life.In Equatorial Guinea  the integration of womeninto our development process is receiving theGovernmentís utmost attention through the design ofliteracy programmes for them and their gradualintegration in economic activities and politicalinstitutions with a specific percentage reserved forwomen.Lastly  we want environmental problems  whoseeffects are of unforeseeable magnitude in each State  tobe addressed with due sensitivity  respect andsolidarity  in the same way as questions of world peaceand security.We reaffirm that the primary responsibility forpromoting sustainable development in each countryresides directly with the Government concerned.Multilateral and bilateral assistance only complementthe efforts of States themselves and provide guidancefor what must be accomplished internally by eachcountry.Among these efforts  Equatorial Guinea supportsthe Extractive Industries Transparency Initiativeproposed by the United Kingdom. Nonetheless  webelieve that transparency must be required not only ofGovernments but also of the economic players thatcontrol these industries. It is  therefore  necessary thatan international monitoring body be established tointervene in the activities of both Governments andeconomic enterprises.We welcome the report submitted for theAssemblyís consideration as it contains importantrecommendations  above all regarding the developmentprogramme.I wish to conclude by calling for greatersolidarity and a spirit of commitment from all theMembers of the United Nations so that we can makethis Organization an ideological model that serves theaspirations of present and future generations."
"67",2828,"GRC",60,2005,"Let me begin Mr. President  by congratulating you upon yourelection as President of the General Assembly andassure you of my country’s unwavering support foryour endeavours. Your previous experience at theUnited Nations ensures that under your guidance theAssembly will continue to promote the values andprinciples of our Organization.I also wish to extend our sincere thanks to theoutgoing President  Mr. Ping. His tireless efforts in allfields  particularly in the preparations for the High-level Plenary Meeting  have been exemplary.Greece fully subscribes to the statement deliveredearlier by the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdomon behalf of the European Union  as well as to theEuropean Union priorities presented to the GeneralAssembly.I would also like to express our appreciation tothe Secretary-General for his relentless efforts topromote peace and security and to safeguard the moralauthority and the pre-eminent role of our UnitedNations.At the beginning of the twenty-first century  wecontinue to face many threats and challenges thatundermine the basic values and principles of oursocieties and test our will and determination to abideby the obligations and restraints inherent in thosevalues and principles. Only through concertedcollective action  dialogue and mutual understandingcan we confront them and pave the way for a better andbrighter future.Terrorism has emerged as the most importantchallenge of our times  creating an atmosphere ofcollective fear  intolerance and a never-ending cycle ofviolence. Throughout history  violence has neverproven to be an answer to our problems. Peace stability and security can only be achieved throughtolerance  acceptance and the realization that ourcommon interests far outweigh our differences. Thereis no justification whatsoever for terrorism. It is hightime for an urgent collective effort to put an immediateend to that modern scourge.Natural disasters  like the tsunami in Asia and therecent hurricane in the southern part of the UnitedStates — with so many victims and unimaginabledestruction — also demonstrate sufficiently theimportance of international cooperation and the urgentneed for human solidarity.I am fully aware of the importance of economicdevelopment for a considerable part of the world.Security and sustainable development go hand in hand.Our collective commitment and efforts are needed tocorrect the imbalances and disparities in the world. It isonly a matter of time before extreme poverty  hungerand the catastrophic impact of widespread diseases willlead to strife  internal or external. The foremostexample of that is in Africa  where the vicious cycle ofpoverty  conflict and HIV/AIDS produces an explosivecombination ripping apart the fabric of their societiesand threatening them with unprecedented and direconsequences.22Multilateral cooperation is the only way to abetter world. The international multilateral systemmust be enhanced and strengthened. Greece fullyparticipates in the policies formulated by the EuropeanUnion and the various international organizations thatcontribute to the economic development of all areas ofthe world in order to redress existing imbalances.We appreciate the value of cultural diversity in aworld unfortunately so often divided by discrimination.We believe in dialogue among cultures  among peopleand among societies. We fully support the peacefulresolution of all our disputes on the basis ofinternational law and the United Nations Charter. Weare deeply committed to the United Nations and what itrepresents and to effective multilateralism and the pre-eminence of international law.Looking at Greece’s immediate neighbourhood the Balkans  we realize that it has not yet been fullytransformed into a region of peace  stability andprosperity.In Kosovo  the trauma created by the repressionof the past and the inter-ethnic violence that plaguedthe region for so long has yet to be healed. There is aneed for a settlement that is in conformity withinternational legality  as expressed by the UnitedNations  and with European standards and values — asettlement which will enhance regional stability.We remain convinced that European integration isthe only way to find permanent solutions to existingproblems and challenges in the area. At the same time regional cooperation must be strengthened so as toeffectively address the problems of the neighbourhood.Greece  which holds the chairmanship-in-office of theSouth-East European Cooperation Process  isdetermined to strengthen the institutional aspects ofthat process and to develop it into the real voice of theregion.I deeply regret that the Cyprus problem remainsunresolved. In the 31 years of military occupation ofmore than one third of the territory of Cyprus  Greecehas strongly supported every attempt and initiative bythe United Nations to achieve a comprehensivesettlement of the Cyprus problem.In the light of the outcome of last year’sreferendums  which should be fully respected  any newinitiative will have to be carefully prepared so as toensure real chances for success. For our part  we areready to work towards building the necessary commonground  which will render possible the re-launching ofmeaningful negotiations.Our ultimate goal remains an agreed solutionbetween the two parties. We remain steadfastlycommitted to reaching a just and viable solution for thereunification of the island following negotiations onthe basis of the Secretary-General’s plan and therelevant Security Council resolutions  and inconformity with European Union principles and acquis.In this endeavour  Greece will spare no effort.The climate of our bilateral relations with Turkeyover recent years has been constantly improving. Wehave made vigorous efforts to put our relations on anew  solid track. Significant progress has beenachieved in several areas of our bilateral cooperation and Turkey’s European Union perspective will furtherbroaden the scope of our relations.The latest developments in the Middle East allowus to maintain a certain level of reserved optimism.The Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and parts of thenorthern West Bank does  indeed  constitute animportant milestone. This is a momentous opportunityto revitalize the road map and to move the process astep closer to achieving a fair  lasting andcomprehensive peace in the Middle East.The road map remains the framework for theachievement of a just and lasting peace. Both partiesshould concentrate on fulfilling their respectiveobligations and commitments and refrain from any andall unilateral actions which threaten to prejudge theoutcome of final status negotiations and undermineefforts at building confidence on the ground.Our shared goal remains the realization of a two-State solution: Israel and a democratic  viable andterritorially contiguous State of Palestine  living sideby side in peace and security.With regard to Iraq  Greece underlines theimportance of its territorial integrity and unity in theframework of a federal system. We remain particularlyconcerned  however  about the ongoing violence which makes it imperative to follow the timetable ofthe political process that will lead the country tonormalcy  which is of vital importance for peace andstability in the entire region. We fully support Iraq inthis difficult mission.23My country has a long  historic relationship withthe African continent and its peoples. We havewitnessed with great concern the series of conflictsituations that have been plaguing Africa for manyyears. We are following developments in all cases andare trying to make positive contributions  whether inthe Sudan  in the Democratic Republic of Congo orother countries of West Africa  in the settlement of thedispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea  and elsewhere.The emerging pivotal role of the African Union indealing with African crises has our full support anddeep appreciation.Last Friday  we adopted a historic declaration which constitutes a new and important step in thedirection of enforcing collective security andstrengthening the United Nations capacity to deal withthe new challenges and threats that our societies arefacing today. Our efforts should now focus on theimplementation of the commitments made  so thatgenerations to come can live in a better and moresecure world."
"68",2869,"GRD",60,2005,"I am indeed greatlyhonoured to join those who preceded me incongratulating the President on his election to thepresidency of the sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly. I assure him of Grenada's support as heguides the deliberations during this historic yeartowards the promotion and maintenance ofinternational peace and security. My delegation wouldalso like to express its appreciation to Mr. Jean Ping who laboured assiduously during his presidency of thefifty-ninth session  for his tireless efforts in guiding thepreparatory work for the High-level Plenary Meeting.In addition  Grenada commends the Secretary-Generalfor his energetic pursuit of change at the UnitedNations. We subscribe to the Secretary-General's viewthat the world cannot be a safer place withoutdevelopment and poverty eradication.Permit me  at this juncture  to extend  on behalfof the Government and people of Grenada  empathyand profound sympathy to the Government and peopleof the United States of America  particularly those ofthe Gulf states  for the loss of life and severedestruction of property suffered as a result ofHurricane Katrina.When the Millennium Declaration was adopted many viewed it as a landmark document containing theblueprint for the eradication of poverty and as a vehicleto transform the condition of humankind in the twenty-first century. While it did not take on the momentumthat we had hoped for  we have now moved to reviewits implementation. This year  the outcome documentadopted by heads of State and Government at theconclusion of the High-level Plenary Meeting gives usanother chance to address in earnest the commitmentsthat were made in the Millennium Declaration and atmajor United Nations conferences.Grenada is heartened by the recent renewal ofcommitment to development and security  includingpoverty eradication and the endorsement to positivelytransform the world for the betterment of our peoples.We also welcome the efforts made to address thespecial needs of Africa. Those are high ideals  but weare convinced that peace  security and prosperity canonly be achieved globally with the commitment 5sacrifice and concerted  cooperative efforts of allMember States.We welcome the creation of a PeacebuildingCommission to ensure post-conflict recovery where itis most needed  and especially to focus on issuesrelating to women and children within that process.Grenada also supports the strengthening of the humanrights machinery through the creation of a HumanRights Council  and we resolve to participate in thenegotiations to establish a working mandate for thatbody during the sixtieth session of the Assembly.Grenada welcomes the outcome document'sstrong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations. We regret  however  that there has beenno meaningful progress on the issue of disarmamentand non-proliferation and call for continuednegotiations in that regard.Reform is vital in order for this uniqueOrganization to reflect the aspirations of its 191Member States. It is extremely important that theUnited Nations address the burning issues and realitiesthat preoccupy the global community. Grenada fullysupports the measures called for in the Secretary-General's report  ""In larger freedom"" (A/59/2005)  andremains convinced of the usefulness of addressingpeace and security on a broad spectrum.Grenada agrees that Security Council reform isimperative. The Council must be expanded in a mannerthat will convince every region of the world that theyhave an active voice in one of the most important andpowerful organs of the United Nations.Grenada  like the other countries of the English-speaking Caribbean  places a high priority on thereorganization of the Economic and Social Council.The Charter clearly designed the Economic and SocialCouncil to address development. In the twenty-firstcentury  therefore  the Economic and Social Councilmust have  as the outcome document states  a morefocused agenda built around the major themescontained in the Millennium Declaration.The theme for this year's deliberations is wellchosen and we accept the challenge to work towardsthat goal. Grenada hopes that United Nations reformand the implementation of the goals set out in theoutcome document will come to fruition soon  in orderto ensure a stronger Organization and a more justworld.My country  Grenada  knows quite well thechallenges faced by developing countries. In less thanone year Grenada experienced two hurricanes  causinginfrastructural damage amounting to 250 per cent ofour gross domestic product (GDP)  crippling thetourism sector  increasing unemployment to 31 per centand having an immeasurable psychological and socialimpact on our population.Prior to those events  Grenada was well on trackto achieve the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs) of universal primary education  lowering childmortality rates  and reducing the poverty rate by half.Also high on our country's agenda was theimplementation of policies to combat diseases including HIV/AIDS. Today  even with the mostrigorous national efforts  if Grenada is to achieve theMDGs  it can only do so with substantial financial andtechnical assistance.Currently  countries of the Caribbean facegrowing unemployment and poverty because of therecent World Trade Organization ruling that resulted inthe removal of preferential arrangements that oncefacilitated our trade. As a direct result  two of theindustries most vital to the Caribbean ó bananas andsugar ó are rapidly declining  sending thousands tothe bread line and abject poverty. Here  I would refer tothe statement made yesterday by the Prime Minister ofSaint Kitts and Nevis  which confirmed the effects thatthe demise of the sugar industry is having on hiscountry.Countries of the Caribbean require more than justaid; for aid alone cannot eradicate poverty. WhatCaribbean countries desire most fervently are tradingopportunities. We crave opportunities that willrecognize the diversities and disparities in theeconomic world. Given our disadvantageouseconomies of scale  our limited land mass and our lateadmission into the international economic order  it isimpossible to make progress without specialconcessions.Grenada has no desire to see its futuregenerations become mendicants  seized by poverty anda lack of opportunities. The MDGs  as well as UnitedNations declarations  constitute a global partnership fordevelopment. Both the developed and developingcountries are called upon to implement changes andadjust their modus operandi to advance a more secureand just world.6We applaud the European Union for its decisionto increase its overseas development assistance to therecommended 0.7 per cent of their GDP. However  weurge them and other developed countries to continue toprovide freedom in trade with developing countries  inorder to facilitate the transfer of technology and toassist with our environmental protection.Those of us in the developing world have alsogiven our commitment to devise national policies toimprove the standard of living of our people  promoteeducation  practice good governance and strive forbetter health care for all. That  however  is virtuallyimpossible in the current international economicclimate  as some international regimes seem committedto crippling the economies of developing countries  inparticular those of the Caribbean.Hurricanes and other natural disasters add to theCaribbean region's challenges and remain a very realand formidable enemy. Grenada acknowledges thatnatural disasters are unavoidable phenomena thatcannot be stopped. However  we can mitigate theireffects  ease human suffering with sound measures andspeed up recovery by designing mechanisms conduciveto quick responses  particularly from the internationalcommunity. From hurricanes to tsunamis  from floodsto droughts  we have come to realize that naturaldisasters know no boundaries and do not differentiatebetween developed and developing countries. In thelight of scientific predictions that indicate an increasein the frequency and intensity of natural disasters  wemust address this matter and give disaster mitigation ahigh priority on our agenda.I recall that during his address to the MillenniumSummit five years ago  the Prime Minister of Grenada the Right Honourable Keith Mitchell  joined hiscolleagues in making a clarion call for theestablishment of a disaster relief fund to facilitatequick responses to aid victims of hurricanes earthquakes  volcanoes and other natural disasters thatstrike us with such frequency and ferocity. I wish toreiterate that call today in light of the realities that nowsurround us.Some countries  particularly small islanddeveloping States  are extremely vulnerable and canexperience a complete reversal of economic  social cultural and infrastructural progress with the passageof one natural disaster  as was evident when Grenadawas struck by Hurricane Ivan in September of 2004.For small islands it is exceedingly difficult to stop thedownward spiral that disasters can cause. Generally recovery is virtually impossible without majorinternational assistance.Grenada welcomes the reference made to thevulnerabilities of small island developing States. Welook forward to the effective implementation of theMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation ofthe Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States in thevery near future. Grenada implores Member States tosupport the call of small island developing States forspecial recognition of their vulnerabilities.In the same vein  I turn now to the issue of theCaribbean Sea. Our economies derive tremendousbenefits from the resources of the Caribbean Sea. Infact  the annual estimate of the economic value toGrenada of production from the sea is more than 30million Eastern Caribbean dollars. That is acontribution that we as a people strongly feel must beconserved  preserved  maintained and protected  notmerely for this generation  but for future generations.I would like specifically to refer to the trans-shipment of radioactive materials through our waters which continues to pose a tremendous threat to thehuman health  marine life  ecosystems  tourism andeconomies of the region. As has been repeatedlyaffirmed by Grenada and other Caribbean Communitymember States  that practice must stop. Grenada onceagain calls on those concerned to desist from suchactivity. We welcome the reference made in theoutcome document in that regard  and further urge theinternational community to be more cognizant of thesituation and its impact on our economies and ourpeoples. Since this matter is of grave importance to theCaribbean region  we will continue our efforts to havethe Caribbean Sea designated as a Special Area in thecontext of sustainable development.Finally  judging from the commitments madeover the past few days  it is clearly evident thatMember States are willing to take up the challenge toimplement the necessary reforms to strengthen thisbody. We too pledge our full support to that process despite the bleak economic realities we currently face."
"69",2916,"GTM",60,2005,"As a founding Member of the UnitedNations  Guatemala would like to reaffirm  before theGeneral Assembly  its faith in and commitment tohuman rights and fundamental freedoms  the sovereignequality of States and participatory  transparent anddemocratic multilateralism. The United Nationscontinues to be the best tool available to humanity inits endeavour to accomplish that goal.The goals that the Charter signatories set forthemselves six decades ago have lost none of theirvalidity. Indeed  the attainment of those goals remainsa major challenge for humanity. The goal ofmaintaining international peace and security presentsnew challenges. Its relationship with sustainabledevelopment and the fight against poverty serves as aparadigm in that regard. We are confronting newthreats that make it harder to ensure good governanceand undermine democracy  such as trafficking inpersons  weapons and drugs  as well as terrorism.Small and vulnerable countries  such as mine  areparticularly affected by those problems.We have been trying together to cope with suchnew challenges for some time  but only recently havewe been able to reflect on them and reach a number ofagreements that we trust will enable us to reform theOrganization with a view to address these challenges as a whole  more efficiently and with renewedambition.We support the appeal made by Secretary-Generalat the beginning of the general debate for an“accountability pact” to ensure that the Secretariat andGovernments are effectively held to account andmonitored.Guatemala will continue to participate actively inefforts to set up the Peacebuilding Commission. Ourown national experience will enable us to contributeactively to those efforts.We will also contribute to the effort to achievethe speedy conclusion of a comprehensive conventionagainst international terrorism and to theimplementation of an integral strategy aimed at thesuppression of that scourge.We attach equal importance to the creation of astanding Human Rights Council  the composition ofwhich is to be agreed upon during this session  with aview to properly focusing  depoliticizing and making26more effective the discharge of our responsibility toensure the full observance of human rights. Weresolutely support the strengthening of the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights  which should be provided with the resourcesnecessary for it to carry out its work effectively.Similarly  we have no hesitation in supporting theresponsibility to protect.We consider it essential to make decisiveprogress in the areas of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation by means of initiatives such as that putforward by Norway  Australia  Chile  Indonesia  theUnited Kingdom  Romania and South Africa  whichGuatemala supports.As regards the principal organs  we support thestrengthening and revitalization of the GeneralAssembly  whose task is to provide political guidancein connection with the work of the Organization. Wemust restore to the Economic and Social Council itsleading role in the area of sustainable development and continue to enhance its cooperation with theSecurity Council.We urge the broadest support by Member Statesfor the reform of the Security Council. It is essentialthat that reform effort be comprehensive and that itinclude a review of the Council's methods of work andof the procedures by which decisions are taken  thepurpose being to strengthen the Council and to make itmore legitimate  ensuring that it reflects present-dayrealities and represents developing countries. We aresympathetic to the aspirations of Brazil  Germany India and Japan to become permanent members of theCouncil  as well as to the call for additionalrepresentation for Africa.When addressing the Assembly one year ago Oscar Berger Perdomo  the President of Guatemala sought to express the feelings of our country at thatcrucial time in its history. I am pleased on this occasionto share with the Assembly some of the advances wehave made since then.Not only were the Peace Agreements integratedinto the Government plan  but the framework law onthose Agreements was enacted. Social dialogue hasbeen pursued in all areas of Government action. A 43per cent reduction in the strength of the army wasachieved  and there was progress in modernizing andprofessionalizing it. In line with this  the Guatemalanarmy has increased its participation in United Nationspeacekeeping operations and is now in Haiti and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.Public expenditure is concentrated in the socialarea and in infrastructure  for which 60 per cent of the2006 national budget is earmarked. A secretariat forfood and nutritional security has been created  while aState policy in those matters has been drawn up  with aparticipatory and sustainable focus. Significantactivities are being carried out at the national level andjointly with other Central American countries tocombat common crime and transnational organized crime.A programme for economic and social reactivationcontinues to be implemented with enthusiasm  acadastral law was recently enacted and a competitionpolicy  adopted by consensus with the participation ofcivil society  will be presented next week.The fight against poverty and social exclusioncontinues to occupy a central position in all theactivities of the Government and is carried out in amanner that fully respects the ethnic  cultural andlinguistic diversity of the country. Recently  weestablished a national policy for indigenous peoples which was presented by the Nobel Peace Prize laureateand Ambassador for the Guatemalan PeaceAgreements  Rigoberta Menchu.Appropriate legal proceedings continue to betaken against persons guilty of acts of corruption. Fulltransparency continues to be ensured in the area ofGovernment procurement.Our commitment to the full observance of humanrights is being maintained at the national level. Inter-agency activities are being carried out under therecently adopted national human rights programme.The United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights has established an office in Guatemala  thefunctions of which are to provide advice to theGovernment  State entities and civil society in order tostrengthen the promotion and protection of humanrights in our nation.Nevertheless  the advances made are increasinglybeing compromised by an inordinate increase in theprice of fossil fuels  which has an extremely negativeeffect on countries whose open economies  like that ofGuatemala  are net importers of oil. Our oil bill isabsorbing an increasing percentage of the foreignexchange generated by exports of goods and services.At the same time  we have had to cope withconsiderable increases in the cost of transportation and27of electricity  with their multiplier effect on productivesectors and the price of basic consumer goods. Theeffects of all this at the level of the economy as awhole and at the macroeconomic level threaten to slowdown the expansion of our economy. For our part  weare doing all we can to conserve energy and developalternatives to hydrocarbons. We appeal to theinternational community to cooperate with us inmitigating the impact of this situation.Guatemala is taking actions to strengthendemocracy at the national level by consolidating aregime that is democratic  participatory and inclusive.Our commitment to democracy in the world isunshakeable. That is why we are participating activelyin forums that seek to promote and defend those rights and we also support the Democracy Fund.My country’s foreign policy has as its mainobjectives achieving better inclusion of Guatemala inthe world  strengthening multilateralism and regionalintegration. We have strengthened our ties withcountries and groups of countries with which we haverelations and are united by institutionalizedmechanisms of cooperation; moreover  we haveestablished new strategic associations with countriesand groups of countries in South America  theCaribbean  Asia and Africa.Considerable advances have been made this yearin regional integration. Progress has been made in thejoint assessment carried out with the European Unionto launch negotiations in 2006 for an association andfree trade agreement between both regions.The Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) withthe United States  which includes the Central Americancountries and the Dominican Republic  offers greatopportunities to our country for the generation ofemployment  increased investment and legal certainty.However  as we enter CAFTA-DR  the credit rating andexport promotion agencies of the developed countrieshave assigned us a risk rating less favourable than whatwe consider it should be. Along with otherconsequences  that situation unfairly increases the costof credit for us. Guatemala has one of the best debt-servicing records in Latin America  one of the world’sbest external debt indicators  well-established workingrelations with all multilateral agencies  sustainedeconomic growth for more than 15 years  a stablecurrency  a single-digit rate of inflation and a highlevel of monetary reserves.Strategically  Guatemala has advanced in thenegotiation of trade agreements with Colombia  theRepublic of China in Taiwan  the Russian Federation Belize  MERCOSUR  CARICOM  the Andean Group Chile  Canada  Egypt and Israel.Another fundamental pillar of Guatemala'sforeign policy is caring for the needs of Guatemalanmigrants. The Government endeavours to solve theirproblems and to ensure that their human rights arerespected  taking actions for that purpose at thenational and international levels. We appeal torecipient nations  particularly the United States  tofacilitate the regulation of the status of Guatemalanmigrants in their countries. For those reasons  wecontinue to cooperate at the international level with allefforts aimed at resolving the problems that migrantsface. We welcome the recognition contained in the2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) on thelink between international migration and development.Guatemala will continue to take the necessarysteps to put an end to poverty in the country and toattain sustainable development. Prioritization of publicexpenditure at the national level is not sufficient for themagnitude of the actions we are setting out toaccomplish. We consider it imperative to ensure thesuccess of the Sixth Ministerial Conference of theWorld Trade Organization (WTO). By definition  theDoha Round should place development at the heart ofits negotiations  and we trust that  when we meet inHong Kong in December  we shall take decisions thatby and large are consistent with the aspirations ofdeveloping countries. We need to have a level playingfield in trade and agricultural commodities  and weneed wider access to the markets of the most dynamiceconomies in the world for our goods and services  aswell as to expand and diversify our product base.We welcome the offer made by President Bush inthis Hall to speed up the elimination of all tariffs andsubsidies that distort free trade in the world. We urgedonor countries  development agencies and theinternational financial system to increase theirfinancial and technical cooperation with medium andlow-income countries  with a moderate debt level  oneof which is my country  Guatemala.I wish to stress in particular our concern for thesituation of the 23 million inhabitants of the Republicof China in Taiwan  whose aspirations forrepresentation in international organizations remain28unfulfilled. Guatemala  which is committed to themaintenance of international peace and security as wellas to the peaceful settlement of disputes  appeals to thecountries bordering the Taiwan Strait to refrain fromany threat or use of force and urges them to resolvetheir differences through dialogue.We also express our hope that the difficultsituation in the Middle East will have a satisfactoryoutcome  in conformity with Security Council resolutions242 (1967)  338 (1973)  1397 (2002) and 1402 (2002).We are heartened in that regard by the efforts andprogress made in the Middle East peace process  andparticularly by the dialogue begun between the parties the implementation of the road map  and theimplementation of the disengagement plan.One cannot avoid recalling here  during thisanniversary of our Organization  the millions ofpersons who perished during the Second World Warand the Holocaust as a result of the power oftotalitarianism. Our presence here also recalls us to thestruggle to recover democracy  freedom and the dignityof the human being.Hope was born from the liberation of men women  boys and girls from the concentration camps the end of the war and the adoption of the Charter inSan Francisco. We cannot disappoint those hopes orreturn to the past. The United Nations must deliver onits promises and continue to offer humanity anopportunity."
"70",2959,"GUY",60,2005,"Following closely  as itdoes  on the heels of last week’s High-level PlenaryMeeting  the remainder of the sixtieth session of theGeneral Assembly is challenged to take steps towardsthe early implementation of the agreed outcome. In theeyes of many  the summit document (resolution 60/1)is less than satisfactory in terms of both its scope andits substance. Nonetheless  it represents a commonplatform on which we can build further to reach higherlevels of international cooperation.To you  Mr. President  my dear friend  falls thetask of spearheading that enterprise. Your outstandingdiplomatic experience assures us all that you willsucceed in the mandate given to you. If I am to giveyou any advice on how you should now proceed  Iwould simply echo — and then perhaps very slightlyparaphrase — the words of Dag Hammarskjöld  yourcompatriot and former Secretary-General  when hesaid  “Never measure the height of a mountain untilyou have reached the top”. To this I would add  thenyou will see that the climb was not all that bad.We owe a debt of gratitude to His ExcellencyMr. Jean Ping of Gabon  the outgoing President  for hiseffective stewardship of the work of the Assemblyduring the fifty-ninth session. To the Secretary-GeneralI wish to express our appreciation for his effort toequip our Organization for the challenges that weconfront today.I would also like to offer our appreciation andthanks to our host country  the United States  and torenew to it our assurances of sympathy with regard tothe severe losses suffered in the wake of HurricaneKatrina.As was stated earlier by President Jagdeo ofGuyana (see A/60/PV.8)  international developmentgoals — and especially the Millennium DevelopmentGoals  which were set at the Summit five years ago andwhich we have just reviewed — remain an importantbenchmark for global development. Aimed at securingthe important prerequisites for our economic and socialadvancement in such areas as health  education andother basic services  they must be fully embraced andpursued by the international community.My own country has been diligent in workingtowards those objectives. Through a visionary poverty-reduction strategy and the allocation of more resourcesto the social sector  we have been able to improve thelot of the disadvantaged among our population andenlarge their opportunities for a better life.Unfortunately  however  further progress is now beingjeopardized by a number of untoward developments.Among these has been the recent revision of Europe’sagriculture policy  and more particularly the EuropeanCommission’s proposal to drastically reduce the pricefor the sugar exports of African  Caribbean and PacificStates. That proposal  if implemented  will seriouslyaffect our own sugar industry and will plunge many ofour people who depend on it into extreme poverty.Our economy stands to lose some $40 million peryear  a sum that nullifies the $8 million which we willhave received as a result of the recent Group of Eightdecisions on debt relief. The result is an example of theskewed and often incoherent policies pursued by somedeveloped countries. Without consultation or warning they adopt measures that wreak enormous havoc on theeconomies of developing countries  particularly thesmall and the vulnerable.The only hope on the horizon for us lies in thepromise held out by several recent initiatives  such asthe Millennium Challenge Account of the UnitedStates  the International Finance Facility of the UnitedKingdom  the Action Against Hunger and PovertyInitiative  led by Brazil and other States  and  morelatterly  the levy on air travel suggested by France and11others for the financing of development. As the reviewof the Millennium Development Goals has revealed  anadditional $50 billion will be needed annually to reachthe targets set. New and additional resources aretherefore clearly required if we are to make any impacton global poverty.While we in the developing world would prefer torely on trade instead of aid for our development  theprospects for improving our position are bleak. Theroad from Cancún to Dalian to Hong Kong has beentedious  strewn with obstacles and  now  highlyuncertain. As in New York  developed countries seemcontent with making broad declarations rather thanspecific commitments. The calls by small economiesfor special and differential treatment have thus far beenonly grudgingly acknowledged. Yet  without full regardfor paragraph 35 of the Doha Declaration  countrieslike mine are likely to be further marginalized by theglobal economy.Economic and social progress will come to thedeveloping world only when its countries are allowedto have a say in the decision-making on developmentissues. The chapter in the 2005 Human DevelopmentReport on our interdependent world quotes an Africanproverb that states that “Until the lions have theirhistorians … tales of hunting will always glorify thehunter” (p. 113). It is therefore time for the developingworld  which has long been considered only an objectin the development process  to be given a more activeand participatory role in the process. Only then will webe able properly to address the outcome of our policies.Many of the prescriptions for poverty eradicationhave been based on the time-worn theory ofdevelopment that posits that the increasing economicprosperity of the developed world will eventually raisethe standard of living for all States — that is to say that a rising tide lifts all boats. But any serious analysisof that development paradigm as it has functioned overthe past several decades will amply demonstrate thatthat is a very flawed concept. The gap between richand poor countries continues to widen  a reality towhich the 2005 Human Development Report amplytestifies.There therefore has to be a serious globalrethinking of what constitutes real and sustainabledevelopment. We cannot avoid the conclusion thatwhile the realization of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals will provide the necessary foundation fordevelopment  true economic and social progress cannotbe achieved in the absence of a more comprehensivepolicy framework that encompasses significantassistance and investment flows  wider debt relief more equitable trade and economic cooperation and thetransfer of science and technology for developmentpurposes. That realization has led my Government toadvocate at the United Nations the promotion of a newglobal human order: a more comprehensive and holisticstrategy based on equity and social justice.With regard to the second major area of concernaddressed in the Secretary-General’s report entitled “Inlarger freedom” (A/59/2005) — namely  the issues ofdemocracy  human rights and security — let me saythat Guyana  as a newly restored democracy  fullysupports the promotion of all fundamental humanfreedoms and values. After all  they constitute thebedrock of the United Nations Charter and the basicrights of our peoples. We therefore welcome theinitiative to establish a Democracy Fund to propagatethe democratic ideal  as well as the setting up of aHuman Rights Council to replace the currentCommission on Human Rights.Raising the status of the Commission on HumanRights can do much to enhance respect for humanrights. We are concerned  however  about therepresentative character of the proposed Council andwould be seriously distressed if it were to emerge as anelite directorate sitting in judgement of other Statesdeemed to be less than equal. The holier-than-thouattitude of some countries on matters relating todemocracy and human rights is not acceptable in anOrganization founded on the principles of the equalityof States  mutual understanding and respect. No one isperfect  and we all fall short of the glory of God. Itwould therefore be imperative for the GeneralAssembly  in its further consideration of that proposal to carefully examine such issues as the criteria formembership  size and voting procedures  in order toensure that the principles of the Charter are notvitiated.Finally  there is the third leg of the report’sthematic tripod  namely  security. As is nowuniversally recognized  security is a sine qua non forthe protection of democracy and human rights  as wellas for the promotion of development. It is thereforeessential  in view of the vast array of threats tointernational peace and security  that we mount thenecessary defences against the spread of terrorism 12transboundary crime  arms and drug trafficking disease and the increasing incidence of naturaldisasters  which must now be an integral process of ourdevelopment analysis. Unfortunately  however  the costof such measures takes a very heavy toll on our limitedhuman and financial resources — resources that can bebetter spent in the area of development.To illustrate the challenge we face  let me cite thecase of my own country  which  after suffering adisastrous flood earlier this year that led to a loss ofalmost 60 per cent of our gross domestic product(GDP) — according to an assessment by the EconomicCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean —now faces spiralling oil prices  amounting  in terms ofexpenditure  to 24 per cent of GDP and heavy revenueloss to our sugar-export earnings. How can one speakmeaningfully in such circumstances of achieving theMillennium Development Goals? Small countries likeours have to find solutions to these pressing problems or else run the risk of being thrust further back intounderdevelopment.For several decades now  we have been seeking toreform the United Nations system to make it moreresponsive to the challenges of our times. To someextent we have succeeded in our effort but  clearly much more remains to be done. We therefore urge thePresident to hold to his promise and to pursue therevitalization of the General Assembly  the mostdemocratic and representative of the United Nationsorgans  to enable it to promote the high principles andpurposes of the Charter. The potential of theAssembly’s role in fighting the scourge of war andpromoting development is yet to be fully explored andexploited. At the same time  it is necessary to bringdevelopment issues  which are now largely the purviewof multilateral financial institutions  more fully withinthe ambit of the United Nations  particularly theEconomic and Social Council  where developingcountries can have a greater voice on matterspertaining to their welfare.Of some urgency is the reform of the SecurityCouncil  the organ responsible for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. It is time that theCouncil be made more equitable in its composition more democratic in its decision-making and moreeffective in its operation. The deliberations of therelevant working group have generated wide-spreadagreement on the need for expansion of the Council’smembership. The various permutations have beenexplored  and all options are on the table. We are nowoffered a historic opportunity to reform the Council —an opportunity that  if not taken now  may not sooncome our way again. My delegation therefore urges theAssembly to expedite and conclude its work in thisarea.The latest proposal for an advisory PeacebuildingCommission is a welcome one  since there is a clearrelationship between conflict and development. Muchtoo often  the gains made in the area of conflictresolution are rapidly negated by the lack ofaccompanying measures to preserve stability andencourage development. Such a commission  ifproperly conceived and constituted  can usefullycomplement and optimize the work of the principalorgans of the United Nations.In the end  however  if we are to achieve astronger  more democratic and effective UnitedNations  we will have to go beyond the reform of itsorgans and agencies to a reform of the attitudes andbehaviour of States  which  while giving lip service tosuch concepts as partnership  cohesion andinterdependence  fail to practice those virtues in theirrelations with other States. There is always a vastdivide between declarations and deeds. Yet  theimplementation of the common agenda that we have setourselves at the sixtieth session is not possible withouta greater commitment to change.As the 2005 Human Development Report states  itcannot be business as usual for the United Nations. TheMillennium Declaration must be more than a paperpromise. We need to“mobilize the investment resources and developthe plans needed to build the defences that canstop the tsunami of world poverty”. (2005 HumanDevelopment Report  p. 2)That is the challenge issued to the sixtieth sessionof the General Assembly  and the yardstick by whichits success will be judged. For the sake of the billionswho continue to live in fear and want  we must seek toachieve that larger freedom that is the birthright of allhumankind."
"71",3029,"HRV",60,2005,"Allow me  Sir to express the pleasure of the Republic of Croatia atyour election to the post of President of the GeneralAssembly. At this crucial moment in the history of theUnited Nations  we are gratified that a friend ofmultilateralism will be guiding the work of theAssembly. May I also commend the work of yourpredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  for his remarkableleadership and tenacity in bringing the fifty-ninthsession to a successful conclusion.I would like to extend the sincere condolences ofthe people of Croatia to the people of the United Statesof America on the loss of life and suffering occasionedby Hurricane Katrina. We can take some small comfortfrom the fact that at such times of need nationsinstinctively reach out to help others. This providesvivid illustration of the best of humanity and itsenormous potential to do good and build a betterworld.We believe that the United Nations continues tobe indispensable for building a better world. All Statesbenefit from a strong United Nations. Small andmedium-sized States  which form the great majority ofMembers  can articulate their diverse interests at theglobal level through this universal forum moreeffectively than in any other. Croatia remembers thatthe United Nations played a prominent role in itsre-emergence as a sovereign State.Yet the difficulty with which agreement wasachieved on the outcome document reflects the presentstate of the world in which we live. We should not lookat this imperfect document through rose-coloredeyeglasses. Rather  we should grasp the potential that itholds for moving towards broader and deeper reforms.While we may have broad agreement on the goal ó amore efficient and effective United Nations working inthe service of mankind ó we have created only someof the contours of reform. As the Secretary-General hasreminded us  we should not consider that the job hasbeen done. The details remain incomplete.Let us move now to the details without delay. Letus move forward in helping developing countriesachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).Let us operationalize the Peacebuilding Commissionand the Human Rights Council. Let us introduce theprocesses required to strengthen Secretariatmanagement.Diplomacy is often about compromise. That wordhas been used frequently in describing the WorldSummit Outcome document (resolution 60/1).However  compromise should not be used as asynonym for regression. Development is a pillar of theUnited Nations mandate  and the MDGs areinternational obligations.Over the years  the development dialogue hasresulted in a number of key international documents which bear witness to the progress on poverty-relatedissues and the ways in which we have agreed toaddress those vital challenges. Johannesburg andMonterrey are prominent among them.While it is important to reaffirm the agreedinternational development framework  it is equallynecessary to move forward. Comprehensive debt relief on which there was progress earlier this year atGleneagles  and better trade access to the markets ofdeveloped countries  which must be an outcome of theDoha round  chart the way forward.The road to the achievement of the MDGs onwhich we set out five years ago has been an unevenone. There has been rapid growth in some parts of theglobe  resulting in the movement of millions out ofpoverty. At the same time  sub-Saharan Africa has15stagnated. Small island developing States have specialvulnerabilities which threaten their very existence. Theachievement of the MDG targets by 2015 requiresnational and international implementation strategies.We know that the current level of aid is notenough to achieve the MDGs. It is necessary to look atways to increase the effectiveness of existing aid introduce innovative sources of financing and adhere tothe agreed timetable for progressively increasing flows.In this regard  Croatia supports the Declaration onInnovative Sources of Financing for Development.As a country with an economy in transition andas a European Union (EU) candidate  Croatia isundergoing significant internal structural change andexternal policy scrutiny. We seek to balance those oftencompeting demands by including our MDG obligationswithin the context of other policy implementation inthe transition and EU accession processes. We havedeveloped national development targets based on theMDGs  taking into account our progress to date.From its coastline  with its over 1 200 islands  toits Karst hinterland and the mountains and plainsbeyond  Croatia's environment offers rare diversity in arelatively small geographic area. We are vitallyinterested in the preservation of our nationalenvironmental heritage  as well as of the whole of thecommon environment of mankind. For that reason  wewelcome the extensive treatment of environmentalissues in the outcome document and reiterate oursupport for the key concept of sustainabledevelopment.An effective multilateral system must rely uponthe interaction of States which are responsibledomestic and international actors. In recent years threats to peace and security have become verycommon topics of discussion in global affairs. Withgood reason  much effort has been invested in rallyingthe required international cooperation for the creationof strategies to confront old and new threats to States.Croatia believes that the United Nations shouldcontinue to be in the frontline of that process.The fight against terrorism and transnationalorganized crime is among the greatest challenges weface. Last week  the Croatian President signed theConvention for the Suppression of Acts of NuclearTerrorism. That Convention  which took several yearsto negotiate  is a step forward towards concluding acomprehensive international convention on terrorism.States must make greater efforts to ensure that it comesto fruition during the sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly.Croatia regrets that there has been no meaningfulprogress on disarmament and non-proliferation. Theongoing stalemate  coming  as it does  in the aftermathof the unsuccessful Review Conference of the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) inMay  is a disappointment. We support the recent effortsby a number of States in relation to the NPT-basedupon the three pillars of non-proliferation disarmament and peaceful nuclear cooperation - aswell as the universal adoption of the comprehensivesafeguards agreements and additional protocols.Countries which have experienced conflict andsubsequently rebuilt their national capacities andinstitutions understand well the link between securityand development. Both security and development areindividual pillars of the work of the United Nations.However  we know that together they are vital forsustainable development. Security and development aremutually reinforcing  providing the foundations for thewell-being of individuals and of the States in whichthey live.Croatia took an active interest in the negotiationson the Peacebuilding Commission. It is clear that suchan intergovernmental body is needed to fill a void inthe United Nations system. While the expertise of theUnited Nations in peacekeeping is not in doubt  thechallenges of building and entrenching peace aredifferent. We have argued for the inclusion in themembership of the Commission of countries withnational experience in peacebuilding. We are pleasedthat that position was reflected in the outcomedocument. The inclusion of small States whose ownexperience has spanned the transition from conflict torelief and  subsequently  development  will add animportant dimension which would be absent if theCommission were constituted solely by large  wealthyor powerful States.The Peacebuilding Commission should assistStates to develop and strengthen their key governanceinstitutions and assist local authorities in creating theconditions for sustainable development  includingeconomic growth. It should always ensure that theprocess is one which is driven by the State concernedand by the key stakeholders within it. If internal16conflicts can be quelled and prevented from recurring then we are creating the conditions for a safer world.We believe that the reform of the SecurityCouncil is necessary with regard to both itsmembership and its working methods. We look forwardto further progress being made during the currentsession of the General Assembly on this matter.Clearly  any solution will require the support of aslarge a group of Member States as possible.Croatia has been a factor of stability in aneighbourhood where past instability has taken a heavytoll  not only on the countries in the region but also onthe broader international community. Our enhancedcooperation with our neighbours is a sure basis forentrenching stability and ensuring preconditions for theexpansion of economic opportunities for South-EastEurope as a whole. We shall continue to play thatregional role.Having successfully evolved through thepeacebuilding spectrum  Croatia is now playing its partas a contributor to more than half of the United Nationspeacekeeping operations throughout the world  andtraining peacekeepers from emerging troop-contributing countries. We are using our nationalexperience to help others in need.We are now ready to take the next step in ourresponsibilities as a Member of the United Nations andas a global citizen. For that reason  the Republic ofCroatia has presented its candidature for anon-permanent seat on the Security Council in theelections to be held in 2007.The postulates within the United Nations Charteron human rights serve as a universal measure for allnations and peoples. They are at the core of the workof the United Nations. That is why we have supportedthe efforts to reform and strengthen the United Nationshuman rights machinery. Croatia supports the decisionto strengthen the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and to increase theresources allocated to it. Existing machinery in the areaof human rights - one of the fundamental pillars ofthe United Nations system - requires such reforms.Croatia welcomes the decision to establish aHuman Rights Council as a new organ with theresponsibility for promoting universal respect for theprotection of human rights and addressing theirviolation  wherever they may occur. We aredisappointed that the necessary political will was notfound to conclude an agreement on the Council in thelead-up to the world summit. However  we will workconstructively with other Member States in seekingconsensus so that as yet undecided elements relating tothat Council can be settled during the sixtieth session.Croatia is pleased to see the inclusion of anagreement on the ìresponsibility to protectî in theoutcome document. The frustration and suffering thatcan be caused by inaction on the part of theinternational community  inert in the face ofaggression  has been witnessed all too frequently. Wewelcome this positive development as a step towards anew normative framework.Democracy brings freedom for the individual andcontributes to the legitimacy of States. As a signatoryof the Warsaw Declaration: Towards a Community ofDemocracies  Croatia fully recognizes the importanceof strengthening democracy and advancing its globalacceptance as a universal value. Capacity-building canstrengthen States by reinforcing the institutions thatensure the rule of law  equity  access and stablegovernment.Croatia supports the enhancement of the capacityof the United Nations to promote and reinforcedemocratic institutions and practices around the world.We welcome the decision to establish a DemocracyFund and have  as a concrete measure of our support made a financial contribution towards itsestablishment.Only an efficiently functioning United Nationssystem can respond to contemporary challenges. Thisrequires effective mandates for the principal organs.Yet  there are distinctly different conceptions amongMember States of the principle of State sovereignty.These differences  as we have seen in the recentnegotiations  impact directly upon the prospects ofadjusting the mandates and interrelationships of theprincipal organs of the United Nations to the realitiesof the twenty-first century. We all have more workahead of us on this account.Croatia supports the efforts to introducesignificant human resource management reforms in theSecretariat. The United Nations cannot afford to have aSecretariat that is not managed in accordance withcontemporary standards and practices. For the samereason  we support system-wide coherence  both inmanagement and policy.17There have been many high-minded wordsuttered on behalf of the United Nations in this Hallduring the past week. When we leave this place  let usnot forget the principles that we have invoked and thepledges that we have made. Only this can ensure thatwe accelerate progress towards achievement of boththe MDGs and United Nations reform. For its part  youcan be assured that the Republic of Croatia shallcontinue to be a constructive participant in theseefforts."
"72",3074,"HTI",60,2005,"At thevery outset of my remarks  both on my own behalf andon behalf of the Haitian nation  I would like to expressour sincerest congratulations to you  Sir  on yourunanimous election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at the sixtieth session. Your wealth ofexperience in matters of security  human rights anddevelopment augur well for the success of ourdiscussions.I would also like to pay tribute to Jean Ping Minister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon  whosemoderation  sense of compromise and restraint wonhim universal respect and esteem during the previoussession.May I also express my sincere gratitude to theSecretary-General for his tireless efforts in the cause ofpeace  democracy and development. That triad —peace  democracy and development — is now the newname for progress made by peoples and for stability inthe world.It is in that context that  for more than a yearnow  the Organization has deployed the United NationsStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH)  which ishelping to improve the security climate in the country.We requested the Mission because of our firm belief ininternational solidarity. We would like to take thisopportunity to thank all those countries that havedisplayed their friendship to Haiti by contributing inone way or another to the deployment of MINUSTAH.From this rostrum  I would like to express mysincerest sympathy for the afflicted populations of thesouthern part of the United States of America that havebeen so tragically affected by the passage of HurricaneKatrina in August  one of the most devastatinghurricanes ever to strike our continent. We would likeonce again to express to the Government and people ofthe United States our deepest compassion and ourprofound solidarity in these trying times.Our Organization is now 60 years old. Thecelebration of that anniversary will be a splendidextension of the High-level Plenary Meeting of headsof State or Government  which was intended as aninitial stocktaking of the implementation of thecommitments undertaken in the MillenniumDeclaration.The Government of Haiti supports the spirit ofthe text adopted on 16 September  which broadlyreviews the minimum objectives that the internationalcommunity intends to achieve by 2015. Likewise  theRepublic of Haiti supports all steps taken to increasedevelopment assistance through the use of funds ofsolidarity at the international level.The Government of Haiti attaches the greatestimportance to the proposal of the French Republic tocreate stable and lasting financing through innovativemechanisms in order to prevent and cure the majorpandemics of our time. I am pleased to note that manyof the world’s leaders have received that proposal withthe greatest interest.We also welcome various other initiatives including the United Kingdom proposal for anInternational Financial Facility  which arranges forborrowing on the financial markets to increaseassistance to the poorest countries  in particular for thefight against HIV/AIDS. It deserves our consideration.However  those efforts may not achieve theirobjectives if a comprehensive solution to the debtproblem of the countries of the South is not found. Itwould be a positive contribution to internationalsecurity to solve the debt problem by cancelling the8debts of the least developed countries and helpingthose countries overcome their financial difficulties byassisting their development. The Republic of Haitiunreservedly supports all negotiated  effective comprehensive and lasting initiatives of the UnitedNations aimed at solving the distressing debt problemof the peoples of the poor countries.On the sixtieth anniversary of our Organization we should heed the many calls for the reform of theUnited Nations. Certainly  significant progress is beingmade  in particular the proposal to transform theCommission on Human Rights into a Human RightsCouncil. Chapter XIII of the Charter should beremoved  along with the references to trusteeshipcontained in Chapter XII.With respect to the Security Council  theRepublic of Haiti supports paragraph 153 of theoutcome document  which proposes the early reform ofthe Security Council in order to make it more broadlyrepresentative  efficient and transparent and thus tofurther enhance the Council’s effectiveness and thelegitimacy degree of implementation of its decisions.In that regard  I reaffirm the position of Haiti  asexpressed by Prime Minister Gérard Latortue  in favourof correcting the historical error of not having arepresentative of the Latin American and Caribbeanregion among the permanent members of the SecurityCouncil.The Republic of Haiti is at the crossroads. In afew weeks  general elections will be held throughoutthe country to select the nation’s electedrepresentatives at all levels. The elections arethoroughly inclusive. All sectors and all politicalparties without exception are participating. Admittedly the road to completing the process has been difficult marked by the outbreak of violence and feverishmoments. Rediscovering freedom is not easy. Duringlong months  the country has lived in a situationbordering on chaos  in which armed bands have heldmany of the capital’s neighbourhoods hostage andcommitted the worst atrocities. Fortunately  they havebeen  for the most part  held in check by the combinedefforts of the Haitian National Police and the UnitedNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH).Calm is gradually returning. I am convinced thatthe electoral campaign will take place in a peacefulclimate  in spite of the large number of presidentialcandidates. At present  the horizon is brighteningperceptibly  despite the desperate acts of ruthlessgangs. Also  a national dialogue has been launchedinvolving all relevant sectors of the country. Thepreparatory committee established for the purpose willshortly issue its report.In that context  the Government and the people ofHaiti are grateful to the United Nations and friendlycountries of all continents for their solidarity with Haitiand for their interest in the successful outcome of thepresent elections. Nothing can now stop the marchtowards pluralist and democratic elections  to be heldin a climate of security ensured by the Haitian NationalPolice  with the support of MINUSTAH.Haiti’s chronic political instability and serioussocio-economic problems have compelled a greatnumber of our fellow citizens to migrate toneighbouring shores considered to be more hospitable.However  tensions are now arising among a certainfringe sector of the local population of the hostcountries. We request the leaders of those countries todeal with that issue urgently in order to stop radicalsfrom taking advantage of the situation and committingabuses against expatriate Haitians. For our part  we areopen to all negotiations aimed at restoring calm andfinding solutions in accordance with internationaltreaties and rights related to immigration.At this decisive moment of the transition  werenew our appeal to the international community tovisit us to observe the holding of the elections. Wewant transparent elections in which the candidateselected will not be challenged. We are grateful to theUnited Nations for the support that it is providing toHaiti during this critical period.I reiterate the solemn appeal that I made from thisrostrum one year ago to the international communitynot to leave Haiti isolated  so that  on 7 February 2006 I can hand over power to a new  freely electedPresident  thereby placing Haiti once and for all in thecommunity and comity of democratic nations; so thatthe Government which emerges from the elections canget down to the challenging task of economicreconstruction and social progress — with  of course the resolute support and unflagging solidarity of theinternational community; so that Haiti can emerge fromunderdevelopment and extreme poverty  which providefertile ground for all dictatorships; and so that thecountry can finally recover its unity and its soul.9In that spirit of solidarity and authenticcooperation — which is  after all  the raison d’être ofthe United Nations — the Republic of Haiti will workto achieve  between now and 2015  the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  to which all countries aspire."
"73",3120,"HUN",60,2005,"Let me start byextending to the President my sincere congratulationson his election to the presidency of the sixtieth sessionof the General Assembly. I can assure him that infulfilling his challenging and responsible duties  hewill have the support and full cooperation of thedelegation of Hungary. Our tribute and thanks are alsodue to his predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  who served uswith exemplary devotion and honour.Effective multilateralism remains an importantobjective of the foreign policy of Hungary. Therefore we are pleased to see the United Nations standingready to face the emerging threats and challenges bymaking efforts to adapt its activities to the realities ofour contemporary world.The United Nations has served for 60 years as thecore institution for collective security. In our globaland interdependent world we have to acknowledge thatdevelopment  peace  security and human rights form anindispensable foundation for the security and well-being of our times.My Government is particularly pleased that issuessuch as the fight against terrorism  internationalprotection of human rights  the proposed HumanRights Council  the establishment of the PeacebuildingCommission  the reform of United Nationsmanagement  as well as challenges related todevelopment  have found proper reflection in therecommendations of the summit.International terrorism continues to be a majorthreat to our societies. The recently experiencedhorrors of terror are sowing the seeds of instability allover the world. Hungary  along with its partners in theEuropean Union and NATO  strongly condemns allforms of terrorism. Measures taken in the course ofcombating terrorist forces  however  must alwaysremain in conformity with basic internationalstandards  in particular with human rights and refugeeand humanitarian law. We believe that the UnitedNations needs to accord top priority to the fight againstthe scourge of terrorism. My country is keen to see theelaboration and adoption by the General Assembly of acomprehensive convention on terrorism  which would among others things  give the proper legal definition ofterrorist acts.Freedom  democracy and human rights shouldconstitute the basic framework of life for everyindividual. We know from experience that they are notgranted automatically; they must be won and enforcedthrough hard and persistent efforts. It is of paramountimportance therefore that essential human rights-related activities  such as servicing the treatyimplementation machinery or monitoring undertakenby the special procedures  are given their due share inthe funding provisions of the United Nations regularbudget.Driven by the objective to promote democracy inthe world  the Government of the Republic of Hungaryhas established the Budapest International Center forDemocratic Transition. The Center is set to provideassistance for democratic reforms drawing upon theexperience of countries that have recently undergonepolitical  economic and social transition. Thesenations  having had to face and address the challengesof transition in the recent past  can probably best serveas helping hands to countries in need in this regard.It is in the same spirit that Hungary warmlywelcomes the establishment of the United NationsDemocracy Fund. The Budapest International Centerfor Democratic Transition will be eager to coordinateits activities with the Fund in the framework of a closecooperative relationship.Hungary finds the resolution to establish a newUnited Nations mechanism dealing with the rights ofpersons belonging to national  ethnic  religious andlinguistic minorities to be highly encouraging. Theappointment of an independent expert on minority11issues is an important step in the right direction. TheUnited Nations however still has a long way to go inmeeting the full scope of its responsibilities withregard to the international protection of minorityrights.Educating young generations about the lessons ofthe past is an essential tool to combat discriminationand intolerance. For this reason a day of Holocaustremembrance has been introduced into Hungarianschool curriculum. It is in that same spirit that Hungarysupports the proposal to place Holocaust remembranceon the agenda in the United Nations General Assembly.Hungary recognizes that development is a centralgoal by itself and is ready to reaffirm its commitmentto eradicate poverty and promote sustainabledevelopment and global prosperity for all. As a newEuropean Union member  Hungary is ready togradually increase her official development assistance.The European Union recently made importantdecisions in support of Africa’s development efforts.We reaffirm our commitment to contribute urgently tomeeting the special needs of that continent.We are encouraged to see that after so many yearsof wars and violence  democratic changes are bearingfruit for the peoples of the Western Balkans. It is morethan promising that the political and economicperspectives offered by the European Union and NATOare the main driving forces today for the countries ofthis region.In order to find lasting solutions to the yetunresolved challenges of the Western Balkans  it iscrucial to tackle the basic issues of security andstability in their broader regional dimensions.Regardless of its future status  it is vital that Kosovo betransformed into a viable entity  capable of exercisingfirm administrative control with a stable law and ordersituation and a transparent  dependable economy.Given the turbulent history of the Balkans  no long-term solution is conceivable without establishingharmonious inter-ethnic relationships. Well-definedand strictly implemented minority rights are theprimary precondition for peace  stability and prosperityboth in Kosovo and in the broader Western Balkans.The Middle East conflict has wide-rangingimplications on global peace and security  on theprospects of the world economy and  last but not least on the fight against international terrorism. Hungary isof the firm view that the road map  based on the two-States principle  still gives us the best chance forreaching a just and lasting solution.The implementation of the Gaza disengagementplan by the Government of Israel has been a step oftruly historic proportions. Thus  the Middle East peaceprocess has been given a new lease on life  but itssustainability is subject to further consistent  boldmeasures by both sides. In order to maintain themomentum  Israel needs to return to the road map while the Palestinian National Authority has todemonstrate its own commitment to the peace processby carrying out the long overdue internal reforms and most importantly  by eradicating terrorism and takingthe law and order situation under effective control.The continued instability in Iraq is a matter ofgrave concern. Hungary strongly condemns the acts ofviolence and terrorism in Iraq  which aim to underminethe process of reconstruction and politicalnormalization. In spite of the alarming securitysituation and the obvious internal instability  thepolitical transition in Iraq is making progress in linewith Security Council resolution 1546 (2004). Theapproval of the recently drafted constitution isindispensable to carry on the political process. Furtherconsistent efforts are required to properly engage allIraqi communities in building a united  stable anddemocratic country.Let me reiterate Hungary’s continued commitmentto provide assistance to the people of Iraq in theirefforts to build a democratic and prosperous countrythat will soon take its due place in the family ofdemocratic nations.Hungary viewed the successful presidentialelections last October as an important milestone on theway to political stabilization in Afghanistan. Theparliamentary elections held only days ago marked afurther major step leading to the establishment ofproper democratic institutions in that country. Hungaryis proud of the humanitarian assistance it has providedto the people of Afghanistan  as well as of thecontribution it has made to facilitate the process ofpolitical stabilization. My country is ready to undertakefurther commitments in order to assist the Afghanpeople in rebuilding their country in peace andsecurity.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionalong with their means of delivery continues toundermine international peace and security. The threat12that terrorist groups and non-State actors will acquirenuclear  biological and chemical weapons is a majorconcern to us all. At the last session of the GeneralAssembly  Hungary expressed its strong support for thefull implementation of Security Council resolution1540 (2004)  and called on all States to establisheffective national export controls. We have noted withsatisfaction that a great number of Member States hadsubmitted comprehensive reports on their nationalmeasures serving the aim and purpose of theresolution.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) is still a cornerstone of internationalpeace  security and stability. The 2005 NPT ReviewConference  however  failed to live up to ourexpectations. The international community needs tofulfil its responsibility in preserving the integrity of theTreaty while promoting its universal character.Recognizing the grave threat posed by biologicalweapons  Hungary will work together with othernations in the run-up to the upcoming Biological andToxic Weapons Review Conference. Hungary willstrive to explore opportunities to strengthen theBiological and Toxin Weapons Convention.My country remains committed to the OttawaConvention banning landmines. We will havedestroyed all equipment under the provisions of theConvention by the end of 2005  well in advance of thedeadline.At the current session  beyond the wide range ofissues to be tackled  we have to make importantdecisions to put on track the implementation of theoutcome document adopted by the High-level PlenaryMeeting of the General Assembly. If we are guided bya sense of common responsibility and firmly anchoredrealism  the momentum for reform will be maintained.The delegation of Hungary stands ready to work inpartnership with other delegations to make this happen."
"74",3167,"IDN",60,2005,"We live in an age ofunpredictable threats  against which there may be noairtight security measures. Tragedy could strike in theform of a deadly epidemic. It could be the handiworkof terrorists  like the attacks against New York City on11 September 2001 or the Bali bombings of 2002. Itcould be a convulsion of nature  like the tsunami thatdemolished the Indonesian province of Aceh andnearby Indian Ocean Rim areas  or the storm tide thatdrowned New Orleans and much of Louisiana recently.On the tragedy of New Orleans  we extend ourdeepest condolences to the American people.We Indonesians know too well the enormoussuffering that a natural catastrophe can bring. In Acehalone  the tsunami of 26 December 2004 killed outrightsome 130 000 individuals. It destroyed 220 000 homesand displaced 572 000 individuals. Some 100 000persons are still missing and presumed dead. The deathtoll would have been higher were it not for the quickand vigorous response of the international communityand the United Nations. For that  the Indonesian people29are deeply grateful. The outpouring of sympathy andsolidarity  as well as humanitarian assistance from allover the world  deeply touched us.Eleven days after the tragedy  we hosted inJakarta a special summit of the Association ofSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on the aftermath ofthe earthquake and tsunami. At that summit  worldleaders and the United Nations Secretary-General  aswell as representatives of multilateral institutions worked out a system of coordination and division oflabour in attending to the stricken countries. Pledgeswere made of urgently needed assistance. A decisionwas reached to develop a multi-nodal early warningsystem covering the Indian Ocean Rim countries.Within ASEAN  an agreement to establish stand-byarrangements to mitigate natural disasters wasconcluded last July. Those efforts were reflected inGeneral Assembly resolution 59/233  initiated byASEAN and sponsored by more than 130 UnitedNations Members.The reconstruction and rehabilitation of Aceh gotoff to an early start as the emergency relief phase wascompleted ahead of schedule. A master plan forreconstruction and rehabilitation was then devised. Anagency for the reconstruction and rehabilitation ofAceh was established and given broad powers.Through the World Bank’s Multi-Donor Trust Fundand bilateral mechanisms with donors  we haveinstituted a strict system that guarantees transparencyand accountability in the disbursement of funds.Rehabilitation and development  however  cannotrun smoothly without peace. And for many years therehas been no peace. Before the tsunami  Aceh saw threedecades of armed conflict caused by perceivedeconomic injustices. Many Acehnese felt that theywere not being given a fair deal by the centralGovernment. As the conflict raged and took a heavytoll on human life  a vicious cycle was at work:violence impoverished the people  and in their povertymany resorted to violence.In the spirit of reform and in a democraticenvironment  efforts to address the problem of Acehthrough dialogue and reconciliation were initiated in2000. Those efforts led to the signing of a finalagreement in Helsinki last month. That was the silverlining in the cloud of 26 December; it opened the eyesof both sides to the hopelessness of the situationwithout peace.It helps that there is international support for thepeace process. At our invitation  the European Unionand ASEAN contributing countries have providedmonitors for the implementation of the peaceagreement. In a way  it has created a precedent for thecollaboration of two regional organizations inpeacebuilding.The decommissioning and destruction of rebelweapons are working according to the peaceagreement. The former rebels are back in the fold ofthe unitary Republic of Indonesia and are fighting onthe same side as the Government in the struggle againstpoverty.Peace and development in Aceh are the fruits ofreform and democratization  which are pervading all ofIndonesia. Starting this year  all local officials governors  regents and mayors are directly elected bythe people. Whereas the former rebel leaders oncesought power through the bullet  they can now seektheir legitimate aspirations through the ballot.Since 1998  we have enhanced our politicalinstitutions through constitutional amendments. Wehave overhauled our legal system  and we are adoptinghigh standards of good governance in the corporate andpublic sector. We have pursued vigorous campaignsagainst corruption.We are now pursuing an economic strategy that ispro-growth  pro-poor and pro-job. We arestrengthening the export sector  promoting investmentsto create jobs and speeding up rural economicdevelopment. In a few weeks  we will put in place asocial safety net that will cushion the impact of highoil prices on the poor. We are on target with ourMillennium Development Goals on poverty reduction.Wherever there is social unrest in Indonesia  webring justice and foster dialogue and reconciliation  aswe did in Aceh.In the same spirit of reconciliation  Indonesia andneighbouring Timor-Leste have reached out to eachother so that both nations might together close apainful chapter in our shared history. Together  wehave established a commission of truth and friendship tasked to bring about exposure of the truth andacknowledgement of responsibility for the humanrights violations committed prior to and immediatelyafter the popular consultations held in Timor-Leste in1999. The commission started its work last August.30The fledgling democracies of the two countries stand abetter of chance of succeeding if they work together ina spirit of reconciliation  friendship and cooperation complementing the prosecutorial justice that has beencarried out in Indonesia and Timor-Leste.With our other closest neighbours in South-EastAsia  we are striving hard to become an ASEANcommunity that is at peace with itself and all others —a prosperous ASEAN living in harmony within thecommunity of caring societies that we have longenvisioned. We hope to see ASEAN play a pivotal rolein the evolution of a new equilibrium in the Asia-Pacific region that will consolidate the peacefulengagement of regional Powers with one another.Today  ASEAN already serves as the driving forcetowards the development of an East Asian economiccommunity.We Indonesians love to build bridges. Last April we served as host to the representatives of 106 Asianand African countries  many of them heads of State orGovernment  for the Asian-African Summit of 2005.During that historic Summit  we put in place thecornerstone for a bridge of cooperation across theIndian Ocean — the New Asian-African StrategicPartnership — on behalf of the 4.6 billion people of thetwo continents. Through the Partnership  bothcontinents will intensify their political solidarity economic cooperation and socio-cultural relations including technical cooperation and human resourcesdevelopment.The establishment of the Partnership was themost meaningful way in which we could observe theGolden Jubilee of the 1955 Asian-African Conferenceheld in Bandung  which heralded the emergence ofmany new sovereign nations from the shadow ofcolonialism. In those formative years of ours  wesought to reform international relations through theUnited Nations.Today  we feel called upon to seek reform of theUnited Nations itself  for we are faced with theformidable challenges of development  security andhuman rights — three challenges that are interlinkedand interdependent and that cannot be addressedseparately. We therefore need a United Nations that ismore effective and efficient and more democratic andaccountable to its Members — an Organization with abalanced focus on those three challenges.We need a reformed Security Council that is moredemocratically representative. As the Asia-Pacificregion is home to more than half of the human race andis the cradle of ancient civilizations and religions  wein Indonesia feel that it should have more seats on theCouncil. Moreover  we must do away with the right ofthe veto.We cannot afford to exclude global disarmamentand non-proliferation from our agenda. We are not ridof the danger of nuclear annihilation. At the same time developing countries must be allowed to engage in thepeaceful use of nuclear energy to hasten theirdevelopment.We need a Peacebuilding Commission to helpcountries in conflict make the transition from war todurable peace. The Commission must work incoordination with the Security Council and theEconomic and Social Council  under the mandate ofthe General Assembly.With regard to the fight against terrorism  wehope that a comprehensive convention can beconcluded soon. International cooperation to addressthis problem should include efforts to deal with its rootcauses. We also hold that no human right may besacrificed and that no international law may be violatedin the fight against terrorism.We in Indonesia believe that interfaith dialogueand cooperation to empower moderate voices cansignificantly reduce violent radicalism. That is why wehave sponsored and hosted Asia-Pacific and Asian-European dialogues on interfaith cooperation.We urge that the Economic and Social Council beempowered to effectively review and coordinateinternational cooperation for development.The envisaged Human Rights Council mustuphold human rights as universal  indivisible andinterdependent. It should be free from politicizationand double standards; instead  it should promotedialogue as well as concrete cooperation. It should be asubsidiary body to the General Assembly.Finally  no effort aimed at United Nations reformcan be complete unless it affirms and makes a realitythe central role of the General Assembly as the maindeliberative body of the United Nations.It may not be realistic to hope that these reformswill be realized this week or in the months to come. We31the Members of the United Nations are not sufficientlyin concert to achieve an early breakthrough. But wewho desire reform must keep faith and persevere.For three decades  armed conflict smouldered inAceh  until it became clear to both sides that the onlyway out of a tragic situation was the way of peace. Formore than three decades  Indonesian reformistsstruggled against the crushing weight of anauthoritarian regime  until it became clear that our onlyway out of the Asian crisis was through democraticreform.We do not know when the moment of truth willcome for the United Nations. We hope that it willcome  not in the wake of a crisis  but at the dawning ofa more enlightened time. Above all  we must neverlose hope in the Organization’s capacity for reform  itsperfectibility. We must keep on working — even harderthan before. Then  when the moment of truth comes we will be ready to seize the opportunity."
"75",3214,"IND",60,2005,"Your election  Sir  asPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtiethsession comes at a significant moment in the history ofthe United Nations. The outcome document adopted byour heads of State or Government shortly after thebeginning of the session represents the culmination ofa long process. It started with the report of the High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change. Itcontinued with the Secretary-General’s “In largerfreedom” report  and the efforts of your distinguishedpredecessor to synthesize those ideas for theconsideration of Member States. We thank all of thoseinvolved for their dedicated efforts.We are united in our commitment tomultilateralism; that is a good foundation for ourfurther efforts. All countries  especially those from thedeveloping world  played a significant role in thenegotiations on the outcome document. Much wasachieved; much has been left out. There arefoundations on which we have to build  but there arealso shortcomings which we need to correct in theprocess of implementation. A notable omission is thetheme of disarmament. Our struggle for multilaterallynegotiated  universal and verifiable nucleardisarmament  in a time-bound manner  must continuewith vigour. The outcome document must serve as aroad map  with its main elements acting as signposts inour discussions over the coming months under yourstewardship  Mr. President.26You  Sir  have suggested a very appropriate themefor the general debate: “For a stronger and moreeffective United Nations: follow-up to andimplementation of the High-Level Meeting inSeptember 2005”. We believe that that captures thespirit and essence of all that we  co-partners in theUnited Nations  wish to achieve.India is the world’s largest democracy. There isno historical precedent for a democracy of over 1billion people. It is a tremendous undertaking. It is alsoan exciting and inspiring one. We are breaking newground. The fact that Indian democracy works is apolitical miracle. The credit goes to the Indian voters.They ensure that India remains secular  democratic andpluralistic.We also believe that we need to do much more toinculcate respect for and acceptance of pluralism. I amreminded of what Mahatma Gandhi  the father of ournation  said:“I do not want my house to be walled in on allsides and my windows to be stuffed. I want thecultures of all the lands to be blown about myhouse as freely as possible. But I refuse to beblown off my feet by any.”Humankind is now learning  to some extent  tocope with the menace of terrorism. We all know thatthat evil is increasingly directed at innocent civilians.It invites the strongest condemnation. We all agree thatthere can be no justification for terrorism in any form.Whether we are considering terrorism or non-proliferation  unless there is a non-selective  uniformand sustained approach  the objectives of theinternational community cannot be achieved. Theoutcome document reflects the joint resolve of theinternational community to fight terrorism. In ourjudgement  there is no institutional setting that is morecapable than the United Nations of providing cohesionand vigour to those efforts.As a victim of terrorism over the past twodecades  India understands  and is fully supportive of the need for United Nations action on counter-terrorism. A key aspect of the implementation of theoutcome document will be the development andadoption by the General Assembly of a strong counter-terrorism agenda to supplement the existing GeneralAssembly and Security Council resolutions on thatissue. As an initiator of the draft comprehensiveconvention on international terrorism  India welcomes and is fully committed to  the decision taken by headsof State or Government to conclude negotiations on theconvention during this session of the GeneralAssembly.The main purpose of the summit last week was toreview the implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration. Unfortunately  most developing countrieswill not be able to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  given current growth rates andlevels of international support. We must strengthenefforts at both the national and the international levelsto take us closer to the development targets set out inthe Millennium document.The Millennium Development Goals embody aquantifiable vision of human dignity and solidarity  aswell as of important economic and social rights. Yet important objectives  such as employment  critical fordeveloping countries  are excluded. India’s use ofinnovative financial instruments for ruralinfrastructural investment  as well as our RuralEmployment Guarantee Bill — recently passed inParliament — I believe may be of interest to otherdeveloping countries.Most of us had much higher expectations of thesummit in the area of development  particularly inagreeing on a definite timetable for the achievement ofthe 0.7 per cent target for official developmentassistance. Unfortunately  that has not been achieved and we have gone down to 0.5 per cent. That is equallytrue of innovative sources of financing becausedeveloping countries cannot break out of the cycle ofpoverty without enhanced resource flows and theapplication of science and technology to meet theirdevelopmental challenges.As India’s own economy develops — at about 8per cent per year — and its technological advancementcomes of age  we are expanding our economic andtechnical cooperation with the developing countries reinforcing our political solidarity. We have extensiveprogrammes in Africa and elsewhere in the developingworld. We are also happy to have contributed to theSouth Fund for Development and HumanitarianAssistance. The India-Brazil-South Africa Facility forAlleviation of Poverty and Hunger is a good exampleof South-South cooperation.India has written off the debts of all the highlyindebted poor countries. Given India’s long-termassociation with and commitment to Africa  we27welcome the recognition given by the High-levelPlenary Meeting to the need to urgently address thespecial needs of our African brothers and sisters. On itspart  India has undertaken several initiatives inpartnership with Africa. The Techno-EconomicApproach for Africa-India Movement initiative isdesigned to promote technology transfer to WestAfrica. The pivotal role of scientific knowledge andtechnology for economic development cannot beoverstated. India stands ready to share its experiencewith the developing countries of Africa and elsewhere.To bridge the digital divide within a countryitself  which sometimes becomes as problematic as it isat the international level  wireless local looptechnology developed in India  which eliminatesexpensive equipment and copper lines  has alreadybeen used in several countries in Africa. India has puttogether a connectivity mission in Africa  using fiberoptics and dedicated satellite. It will support tele-education  telemedicine  e-commerce and e-governance  infotainment  resource mapping andmeteorological services. India is also earmarking $1.5billion for lines of credit to assist developing countries in particular those in Africa  in fighting HIV/AIDS andother pandemics.The international community needs to addressintellectual property regimes that seek to denytechnologies rather than facilitating their transfer to thedeveloping countries  including in the areas ofenvironment and public health.Although both the Millennium Declaration andthe outcome document have spoken of exploiting thebeneficial aspects of globalization  we are yet to agreeon and implement the modalities for such a process.Making the process of globalization fairer and moreequitable remains one of the main challenges of ourtime. At present  the accumulation of wealth isaccompanied by the accumulation of poverty. Ruskin the nineteenth century British author  in his book Untothis Last — a favourite of Mahatma Gandhi —described such wealth as “the gilded index of a far-reaching ruin  a wrecker’s pile of coin gleaned from abeach to which he has beguiled an argosy.” Poverty issometimes attributed to lack of entrepreneurship. Thepoor of the world prove their entrepreneurship everyday by ensuring their families’ physical survival.Regrettably  the summit has not given a clear andcomprehensive direction to the World TradeOrganization (WTO) Doha Round of tradenegotiations. Formulas are not an end in themselves;the end has to be a decrease in poverty and an increasein employment. Therefore  equal treatment cannot beforced on unequal partners. Special and differentialtreatment remains an integral component of all tradenegotiations  including agriculture and non-agriculturalmarket access. India  as a member of the G-20  willcontinue to promote in the WTO and elsewhere theinterests of all developing countries  including thesmall island developing States  the least developed  thelandlocked and the highly indebted poor countries.An achievement of the developing countries inthe Group of 77 is their hard-fought and reasonablysuccessful struggle for progress on systemic issuescritical to good international economic governance. Wehave to build on that to ensure the reform of BrettonWoods institutions and the restoration of the centralrole of the United Nations in setting the internationaleconomic agenda.A change in the composition of the SecurityCouncil is an imperative. The G-4 frameworkresolution has made United Nations reform a centralissue that can no longer be ignored or disregarded.There is a democracy deficit  as the Secretary-Generalalso said in July  in the governance of the UnitedNations. There is not much point in speaking ofinclusiveness  transparency and democracy and leavingthe Security Council as a glaring exception to thoseprinciples. Measures taken so far to revitalize theGeneral Assembly are simply not enough. Only byelecting permanent members committed to renderingunto the General Assembly what is the GeneralAssembly’s can that be done. That is essential for aworld order in which decisions are optimal andtherefore acceptable  and the use of force minimal.Jawaharlal Nehru  India’s first Prime Minister aptly stated: “Above all  we have to participate in thegrowing structure of a world order. We cannot rely onothers to do it on our behalf.” One cannot argue infavour of democracy in the rest of the world and leavethe Security Council undemocratic. Effectiveness is afunction of right decisions with broad support.Negotiations on the outcome document and manysubsequent statements have demonstrated that  if morecould not be achieved on the development aspects oftrade in the document  it is because the SecurityCouncil has not been made representative. Ifinstitutional reform has been faltering and many are28doubtful of securing a just solution  it is because theSecurity Council does not reflect the world of today. Itreflects the world of 1945.The unsatisfactory progress on other issues showsthat critics of Security Council expansion in both thecategories were profoundly mistaken. Security Councilreform  far from hindering progress  was actuallyhelping it. In its absence  fears of intervention haveprevented agreement on a human rights council andother issues. Therefore  Security Council reformremains more necessary than ever and shouldpreferably  as the Secretary-General has said  becompleted by the end of the year. That should be ourmain priority; I doubt if it is. Security Council reformis not about any country’s prestige or power  but abouttransforming the balance of power in the world. Ourexperience in India from the freedom movement topresent times shows that diversity is a source ofstrength and effectiveness. The same would be true of areformed Security Council. We would continue also toengage actively in the strengthening of the Economicand Social Council  the restructuring of the Secretariatand the setting-up of peacebuilding commission.As we observe the sixtieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  I am reminded once again of the wordsof India’s first Prime Minister  Jawaharlal Nehru  whosaid at this very forum 45 years ago:“During these past fifteen years the UnitedNations has often been criticized for its structureand for some of its activities. These criticismshave had some justification behind them  butlooking at the broad picture I think that we candefinitely say that the United Nations has amplyjustified its existence and repeatedly preventedour recurrent crises from developing into war. Ithas played a great role  and it is a little difficultnow to think of this troubled world without theUnited Nations.” (A/PV.882  para. 110)In the life of individuals as well as of institutions the completion of 60 years is a significant moment forstocktaking — certainly in my part of the world. Evenas we reflect upon the functioning of this institutionsince its inception in 1945  all of us gathered here lookforward to the realization of new hopes  aspirationsand  indeed  to a rejuvenated United Nations which isfully geared to meet the myriad challenges of our timesand effectively contribute to the well-being anddevelopment of humanity at large and to managechange.The vision which we have for a better world isbest described in the words of a great son of India  thegreat poet Rabindranath Tagore  who was the firstAsian to be awarded the Nobel Prize in literature. Ishall end my statement by quoting a very famous textof his:“Where the mind is without fear and the head isheld highWhere knowledge is freeWhere the world has not been broken up intofragments by narrow domestic wallsWhere words come out from the depth of truthWhere tireless striving stretches its arms towardsperfectionWhere the clear stream of reason has not lost itswayInto the dreary desert sand of dead habitWhere the mind is led forward by theeInto ever-widening thought and actionInto that heaven of freedom  my Father  let mycountry awake.”"
"76",3260,"IRL",60,2005,"Sixty years ago  ourpredecessors  having adopted the United NationsCharter  made sure that the United Nationsimmediately got down to work. We need to act nowwith the same urgency.In the face of the profound challenges thatconfront the world — some of long standing  somenew — our heads of State and Government last weekagreed on a far-reaching agenda for change. Althoughthe summit did not achieve all that we had hoped for  itis still a major step forward.It is now time for follow-up. On Saturday theSecretary-General proposed an accountability pact. Heundertook to deliver on his obligations but said thatwe  the Member States  must deliver on ours. Thatrequires real political leadership all round. I herecommit Ireland to playing its part.The United Nations has no Member more loyalthan Ireland. But we realize that the United Nationsneeds to change  just as the world around it haschanged. This has to be our focus over the next year.And what we do affects not just us here in this Hall but billions of our fellow human beings.For the first time in its history  the human racehas the capacity to end extreme poverty. The summithas endorsed the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs) as the benchmark of progress towards thatobjective. Ireland will play its full part. Last week  myPrime Minister committed Ireland to reaching the 0.7target by 2012. By that year we will be spending up to1.5 billion euros annually. Moreover  our aid willremain completely untied and directed towards thevery poorest. Africa is  and will continue to be  theprimary focus of Ireland’s aid programme.Over the past year  we have been tragicallyreminded of human vulnerability in the face of naturaldisasters. Their causes may be beyond our control  buthow we react is in our own hands. Ireland will place aneven stronger emphasis on emergency andhumanitarian relief. In particular  we are urgentlyexamining how we ourselves can improve our owncapacity to deliver effective civilian protection in suchcases.Conflict resolution is a vital part of the United Nationsmission. It is not enough to end war. We must win thepeace. Without coherent peacebuilding strategies vulnerable countries may not escape the cycle of17violence. From the start  my country has been a leadingproponent of the Peacebuilding Commission. Now thatit has been agreed  let us work hard to get it up andrunning by the beginning of 2006.At the summit  there was agreement on the vitalprinciple that the international community should takeaction to prevent genocide  war crimes  ethniccleansing and crimes against humanity when theresponsible Governments fail to do so. I hope and praythat such eventualities will never again come to pass.But if they do  we must act in a way which honoursthat solemn commitment. We have failed grievously inthe past and must never do so again.The summit has committed us to strengtheningthe United Nations human rights machinery. I stronglywelcome the decision to double the budget of theOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.And the decision to establish a Human Rights Councilwas very positive. Now the General Assembly mustmove swiftly to flesh out the modalities and thestructure. It must be composed and operate in a waywhich avoids the failings of the past. But the bestfeatures of the Commission on Human Rights  such asits engagement with civil society  must be retained.Ireland particularly values the work of human rightsdefenders in calling Governments to account  and thatmust continue.Once more  we meet in the shadow of terrorism.So many recent and terrible acts remind us that nocountry is immune  as Ireland knows from its own longand bitter experiences. We should agree on thecomprehensive convention on combating terrorismwithout delay during this session of the GeneralAssembly. And all existing specific conventions mustbe fully implemented  and practical cooperation mademore effective.The threat of terrorism requires a robust securityresponse. But that response must be intelligent calibrated and proportionate. It must respect humanrights  fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. Andalthough no cause can ever justify terrorism  thepolitical and social conditions within which it breedsmust also be addressed.We cannot ignore the threat posed to our securityby weapons of mass destruction  including nuclearweapons. Ireland was deeply disappointed at the failureof the recent Review Conference of the Parties to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT). We were equally disappointed at the inability ofthe summit to make any progress on that absolutelyvital issue. But we cannot afford to give up hope. Thelogic in favour of the twin and mutually reinforcinggoals of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferationremains compelling.I welcome what appear to be positivedevelopments with regard to the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea and salute the leadership of itsneighbours and the United States in the negotiatingprocess.Under the NPT  countries have every right tochoose the option of civilian nuclear power. But it isessential that they do so in full accordance with theNPT and under the supervision of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Internationalconfidence in their exclusively peaceful intent is alsovital and  where damaged  must be rebuilt in a clearand fully verifiable way. With our other EuropeanUnion partners  Ireland fully supports the efforts of theEuropean Union three to achieve that outcome withregard to Iran.We must continue to reform the structures of theUnited Nations. The need to align the Security Councilwith today’s realities is widely acknowledged. Thisremains an important piece of unfinished business. Wemust fulfil our commitment to revitalize the Assembly.And we need to take a serious look at how theEconomic and Social Council can better fulfil its role.The Secretary-General has made clear hiscommitment to delivering on management reformwithin the Organization  as was requested by thesummit. Very substantial progress on this questionmust be made during the present session.I would now like to touch on a number of issuesof specific concern to Ireland.In relation to the Middle East and Iraq  theachievement of a lasting peace in the Middle East is ofgreat importance to the entire world. Here  too political will is the crucial ingredient. The initialdifficult phase of Israel’s disengagement fromsettlements in Gaza has taken place peacefully. Thecourage and the commitment of Prime Minister Sharonand his Government have been commendable. Much however  remains to be done.I welcome the determination of President Abbasand his colleagues to take full advantage of the18opportunity presented by the withdrawal. They must with our help  maintain their efforts to ensure peace security and the rule of law. And disengagement willtruly be a success only if Gaza becomes economicallyviable  with free trade and free movement. This isclearly in Israel’s interests  as well as in those of thePalestinians.Disengagement is an important advance. It cannotbe the end  but rather a step towards the fullimplementation of the Quartet’s road map. With thesupport and the assistance of the internationalcommunity  both sides must press forward and renewmomentum towards a permanent peace. It is also vitalthat  in particular in relation to the West Bank — as mydelegation has spelled out in detail on manyoccasions — Israel desist completely from further stepswhich could jeopardize the viability of a two-Statesolution.With respect to Iraq  the people of Iraq faceappalling challenges from terrorism. Despite that  theyhave courageously taken steps towards the restorationof full democracy and the control of their own destiny.The final decision on the adoption of the draftconstitution now rests with the people themselves innext month’s referendum. The international communitymust do whatever it can to ensure that the vote takesplace in a democratic and peaceful way. We have seenelsewhere that  no matter how difficult and imperfectprogress may be  with political will and the support ofthe international community  it is possible to moveforward  away from conflict.The elections yesterday in Afghanistan are afurther welcome milestone in its transition.I also commend the excellent progress made inAceh. I am proud that Irish soldiers are among thosetaking part in the monitoring mission run by theEuropean Union and the Association of SoutheastAsian Nations (ASEAN).Sadly  in Burma-Myanmar  human rights anddemocracy continue to be denied. That is most acutelysymbolized by the continued detention of the heroicAung San Suu Kyi. The cumulative length of herdetention now approaches ten years. Her ordeal is notforgotten by the people of Ireland. I urge ASEAN  inparticular  to demonstrate effective regional leadershipand to heighten pressure on the regime to release herand move along the path of reform.As I said earlier  Ireland is particularly committedto Africa. We contribute substantially to developmentand conflict resolution  and we will continue toincrease that contribution. But external help can doonly so much. In the resolution of various politicalcrises affecting the continent  the key requirement is again  political leadership and vision.We welcome the recent signing of theComprehensive Peace Agreement in the Sudan  whichmust now be fully implemented. I am encouraged that despite the tragic and untimely death of Vice-PresidentGarang  both sides have reaffirmed their commitmentto the Agreement.However  the situation in Darfur continues to bedeeply worrying. My Government fully supports theAfrican Union’s mission to improve security there. Welook forward to early progress in the InternationalCriminal Court investigation into human rightsviolations. The Government of the Sudan and theparties in Darfur must renew their efforts to conclude acomprehensive peace agreement by December  and theinternational community must continue to supportefforts led by the United Nations to providehumanitarian assistance.I welcome recent progress in the Great Lakesregion  in particular in Burundi  where the electedrepresentatives have shown generosity of spirit andcourage. I look forward to parallel progress in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Ireland willcontribute to support for the electoral process there.But I am seriously concerned at the situation inZimbabwe. The downward spiral  which  above all hurts the ordinary people of that nation  must bereversed. The Zimbabwean Government should start byaccepting the recommendations of the SecretaryGeneral’s Special Envoy.Turning to a topic closer to home  in the NorthernIreland peace process it is also time for renewedleadership. There is a real prospect of the fullimplementation of the Good Friday Agreement —which was put together in 1998 and voted by thepeople of Ireland — and the sustained operation of itsinstitutions. The British and Irish Governments arepartners in that endeavour  and we look for others tojoin us in delivering their promises.The Irish Republican Army took a major andcourageous step forward in July. We now expect early19movement to deliver fully  in a verified and convincingway  on its commitment to decommissioning. There isno room for fudge and  equally  no room for anycontinuation of paramilitarism or criminality. Sinn Feinshould also show leadership in moving to support thePolice Service of Northern Ireland and to take theirplace in the governance of policing. The Police Serviceis showing professionalism  courage and even-handedness. The completion of the policing projectwould represent a profound move towards peace andpolitical stability  and I call upon Sinn Fein  inparticular  to take the hard decisions needed.Equally  leadership is needed from within theUnionist community. When the IRA’s commitments arefully delivered and verified  then the way will be clearfor renewed political discussions by all parties on thereactivation of the Northern Ireland institutions. TheUnionist parties say they are prepared to share power when it is clear that the threat of violence has beenremoved once and for all. It should soon be time forthem to demonstrate that good faith.I also look to the Unionist community to showdetermination in condemning and doing all it can todiscourage the continuation of the appallinglawlessness  which has in recent times so badlyaffected both loyalist communities and their vulnerablenationalist neighbours. The need for politicalleadership is so urgent precisely because the prospectof decisive progress is so real and so alluring.Following the summit  we have a collectiveresponsibility to grasp the opportunity to reinvigoratethe United Nations. If we fail  our peoples today and inthe future will not judge us kindly.Ireland gives its full backing to the Secretary-General’s proposals for change. I personally washonoured to act as one of his envoys  because  likehim  we recognized that the United Nations was at afork in the road. At the summit  we chose to start downthe right track  but there is a long way to travel. Ipledge again that over the year ahead Ireland willremain at the forefront of the drive for reform andrenewal."
"77",3307,"IRN",60,2005,"Today  we havegathered here to exchange views about the world  itsfuture and our common responsibilities towards it. It isobvious that the future of the world is intertwined withits current state and with the prevailing trends  whichexhibit signs of hope and despair.On the one hand  certain hopes and opportunitiesexist  and the General Assembly is convened on thebasis of those hopes. Today  human thought reflectssignificant commonalities that provide an appropriatefoundation upon which to build. With the passing ofthe era of agnostic philosophies  humanity is onceagain united in celebrating monotheism and belief inthe Creator as the originator of existence. That is thecommon thread that binds us all together. Faith willprove to be the solution to many of todayís problems.The truth will shine the light of faith and ethics on thelives of human beings; it will prevent them fromengaging in aggression  coercion and injustice; and itwill guide them towards care and compassion forfellow beings.Another hope is found in the common globalappreciation of the sources of knowledge. Althoughreason  experience and science are among the valuablesources of knowledge  the darkness of the Middle Agesprevented major portions of the Western world fromappreciating them. This reactionary tendency deprivedmany of access to various scientific findings andknowledge and led to the exclusion of other sources ofknowledge  namely God and knowledge based onrevelation from the life of human beings in the West ódivine knowledge that was disseminated by suchprophets as Noah  Abraham  Moses  Jesus and5Mohammad. Today  agnostic thinking is on the declineand humanity is equally enamoured of religion science  knowledge and spirituality. This is anauspicious beginning.Divine prophets teach us about proper regard forthe exalted state of human beings on earth. The humanbeing is blessed with dignity  manifested mostimportantly in being the viceroy of the Almighty onearth. The Almighty placed humans on earth to developit  to institutionalize justice  to overcome their egoistictendencies and to praise no lord but the Almighty.Faith and good deeds can bring deliverance and thegood life  even in this world. Attaining this depend onhuman will  that is  the will of each and every one ofus. We must heed the call of our common primordialnature and achieve the realization of this good life.On the other hand  the prevalence of militarydomination; increasing poverty; the growing gapbetween rich and poor countries; violence as a meansto resolve crises; the spread of terrorism  especiallyState terrorism; the existence and proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction; the pervasive lack ofhonesty in inter-State relations; and disregard for theequal rights of peoples and nations in internationalrelations constitute some of the challenges and threatsfacing us.Although these challenges are very real  webelieve we are not predestined to experience them. Ourcommon will not only can change this course but  infact  can lead us to a life filled with hope andprosperity. Divine revelation teaches us that""The Almighty changes the fate of no peopleunless they themselves show a will for change""(The Holy Koran  XIII:11).How can we influence the future of the world?When and how will peace  tranquillity and well-beingfor all come about? These are the fundamentalquestions before us.We believe that a sustainable order - in whichpeace and tranquillity can flourish - can be realizedonly on the basis of the two pillars of justice andspirituality. The more human society departs fromjustice and spirituality  the greater the insecurity it willface  so much so that a relatively small crisis - suchas a natural disaster - can lead to various aberrationsand inhumane behaviour.Unfortunately  the world is rife withdiscrimination and poverty. Discrimination produceshatred  war and terrorism. They all share the commonroot of a lack of spirituality coupled with injustice.Justice is about equal rights; the equitabledistribution of resources in the territories of differentStates; the equality of all before the law; and respectfor international agreements. Justice recognizes theright of all to tranquillity  peace and a dignified life.Justice rejects intimidation and double standards. Asthe eminent daughter of the Prophet of Islam said ""Justice brings tranquillity to our hearts.""Today  the world longs for the establishment ofsuch justice. If humanity heeds the call of itsprimordial nature with firm resolve  justice will follow.That is what the Almighty has promised and what allpeople of goodwill from all religions are waiting for. Ifthe prevailing discourse of global relations becomesone of justice and spirituality  then durable peace willbe guaranteed.Conversely  if international relations are definedwithout justice or spirituality and are void of moralconsiderations  then mechanisms for promotingconfidence and peace will remain insufficient andineffective.If some  relying on their superior military andeconomic might  attempt to expand their rights andprivileges  they will be performing a great disservice tothe cause of peace and  in fact  will fuel the arms raceand spread insecurity  fear and deception. If globaltrends continue to serve the interests of small influential groups  even the interests of the citizens ofpowerful countries will be jeopardized  as was seenduring recent crises and natural disasters such as therecent tragedy of Hurricane Katrina.Today my nation calls on other nations andGovernments to move forward towards a durabletranquillity and peace based on justice and spirituality.The Islamic Republic of Iran was born of amovement based on the pure  primordial nature of apeople who rose up to regain their dignity  esteem andhuman rights. The Islamic revolution toppled a regimewhich had been put in place through a coup and thatwas being supported by those who claim to beadvocates of democracy and human rights. For 25years they thwarted the aspirations of the nation todevelopment and progress through the intimidation and6torture of the population and submission andsubservience to outsiders.The Islamic Republic of Iran is the manifestationof true democracy in the region. The discourse of theIranian nation is focused on respect for the rights ofhuman beings and on a quest for tranquillity  peace justice and development for all through monotheism.For eight years  Saddam's regime imposed amassive war of aggression and occupation on mypeople. It employed the most heinous weapons of massdestruction - including chemical weapons - againstIranians and Iraqis alike. But who  in fact  armedSaddam with those weapons? What was the reaction ofthose who now claim to fight against weapons of massdestruction to the use of chemical weapons back then?The world is witness to the fact that the IslamicRepublic of Iran  because of its humanitarianprinciples - even during the most trying of times andwhen it was sustaining the highest number ofcasualties - never allowed itself to use such weapons.Thousands of nuclear warheads stockpiled in variouslocations  coupled with programmes to further developthese inhuman weapons  have created a newatmosphere of repression and the rule of the machinesof war  threatening the international community andeven the citizens of the countries that possess them.Ironically  those that have actually used nuclearweapons and continue to produce  stockpile andextensively test such weapons; that have used depleteduranium bombs and bullets against tens  perhapshundreds  of thousands of Iraqis and Kuwaitis  andeven their own soldiers and those of their allies afflicting them with incurable diseases; that blatantlyviolate their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); that haverefrained from signing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT); and that have armed theZionist occupation regime with weapons of massdestruction ó they are not only refusing to remedytheir past actions  but  in clear breach of the NPT  aretrying to prevent other countries from acquiring thetechnology necessary to produce nuclear energy forpeaceful purposes.All of these problems emanate from the fact thatthe elements of justice and spirituality are missing inthe way powerful Governments conduct their affairswith other nations.After 11 September  a particular radical groupwas accused of terrorist activities  although it wasnever explained how such huge intelligence-gatheringand security organizations had failed to prevent suchan extensive and well-planned operation.Why have Powers that not so long ago weresupporting the activities of such groups in Afghanistan thereby portraying themselves as supporters of humanrights and of the Afghan people  overnight turned intotheir most fierce critics? Are we to believe that theirbenefactors - those very same hegemonic Powers -have lost control? If so  would it not be better for thosePowers to adopt an honest and transparent approach tothe international community  provide preciseinformation about the main elements and their weaponsand financial support system  and accept responsibilityfor their inhuman actions against nations and countries thereby assisting peoples and nations in addressing theroots of terrorism correctly  wisely and sincerely?We must endeavour to achieve sustainabletranquillity and peace based on justice and spirituality.Terrorism and weapons of mass destruction aretwo major threats facing the international community.The Islamic Republic of Iran  as one of the mainvictims of terrorism and chemical weapons  fullyappreciates the difficulties involved in combating thesemenaces. Today  the most serious challenge is that theculprits are assuming the role of the prosecutor. Evenmore dangerous is that certain parties  relying on theirpower and wealth  are trying to impose a climate ofintimidation and injustice on the world. They arebullying others  while using their huge media resourcesto portray themselves as defenders of freedom democracy and human rights.People around the world are fully aware of whatis happening in occupied Palestine. Women andchildren are being murdered and teenagers are beingtaken prisoner. Houses are being demolished and farmsare being burned down. Yet when the people ofPalestine resist these conditions  they are accused ofterrorism. At the same time  the occupier  which doesnot abide by any principles  terror being part of itsstated and regular policy  enjoys the support of thepreviously mentioned Governments. Let me be stillmore blunt. State terrorism is being supported by thosewho claim to fight terrorism.How can one talk about human rights and at thesame time blatantly deny many people the inalienable7right of access to science and technology  which haveapplications in the fields of medicine  industrialproduction and energy  and hinder their progress anddevelopment by means of force and intimidation? Cannations be deprived of scientific and technologicalprogress through the threat of use of force and on thebasis of mere allegations of possible militarydiversion? We believe that all countries and nations areentitled to technological and scientific advancement inall fields  and particularly to the peaceful technology toproduce nuclear fuel. Such access cannot be restrictedto a few  depriving most nations and therebyestablishing economic monopolies which are then usedas an instrument to expand domination.We have gathered here to defend human rights inaccordance with the Charter of the United Nations andto prevent certain Powers from claiming that somecountries have more rights or that some countries donot have the right to enjoy their legitimate rights.We must not  at the beginning of the twenty-firstcentury  revert to the logic of the Dark Ages and tryonce again to deny societies access to scientific andtechnological advances. The United Nations must bethe symbol of democracy and of the equal rights ofnations. If we talk about the equal rights of nations inpolitical forums  we must talk of the same concept inthis forum as well. Similarly  if we talk about the rightof sovereignty  then all nations must be allowed toexercise their rights on an equal footing and in ademocratic process.The United Nations will be able to be thestandard-bearer of democracy in the world when it itself  is a manifestation of democratic process. Ireiterate that sustainable tranquillity and peace canonly be built on justice and spirituality.The Islamic Republic of Iran is a symbol of truedemocracy. All officials  including the Leader President and members of the Islamic ConsultativeAssembly  city and village councils are elected throughthe vote of the citizens. The Islamic Republic of Iranhas held 27 national elections in 27 years. Thisshowcases a vibrant and dynamic society in whichpeople participate broadly in political life.Because of its key importance and influence inthe important and strategic Middle East region  theIslamic Republic of Iran is committed to contributingactively to the promotion of peace and stability in thatregion.The Saddam and the Taliban regimes were boththe products of foreign Powers. The people ofAfghanistan and of Iraq know very well who supportedthose two regimes. Today  to establish peace andsecurity in the region  foreign occupation forces mustleave and completely hand over the political andeconomic sovereignty of those two countries to theirpeoples.The Islamic Republic of Iran will continue toprovide full and comprehensive support to the peopleof Iraq and Afghanistan and to their electedGovernments and will actively help them establishorder and security. My country will continue to expandits sincere cooperation and interaction with them.In Palestine  a sustainable peace will be possiblethrough justice  an end to discrimination  an end to theoccupation of Palestinian land  the return of allPalestinian refugees and the establishment of ademocratic Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif asits capital.Today  more than ever  nations need constructive positive and honest cooperation and interaction inorder to enjoy a dignified  tranquil and peaceful lifebased on justice and spirituality. Let us enter into acollective covenant to realize this legitimate aspirationof our nations.Here  I should like to talk briefly about theapproach and initiative of the Islamic Republic of Iranon the nuclear issue. Nuclear weapons and theirproliferation  on the one hand  and attempts to imposean apartheid regime on access to peaceful nuclearenergy  on the other  are two major threats tointernational tranquillity and peace.Keeping in mind that in past years no seriousefforts complemented by practical mechanisms havebeen made to move towards full disarmament and more specifically  to implement the decisions andoutcomes of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) review conferences of 1995and 2000  I suggest that the General Assembly  as themost inclusive United Nations organ  mandate an adhoc committee to compile and submit a comprehensivereport on possible practical mechanisms and strategiesfor complete disarmament. Such a committee shouldalso be asked to investigate how  in violation of theNPT  material  technology and equipment for nuclearweapons were transferred to the Zionist regime  and topropose practical measures for the establishment of a8nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Somepowerful States practise a discriminatory approachagainst access by NPT States parties to material equipment  and peaceful nuclear technology. In doingso  they intend to impose a nuclear apartheid. We areconcerned that once certain powerful States completelycontrol nuclear energy resources and technology  theywill deny access to other States and thus deepen thedivide between powerful countries and the rest of theinternational community. When that happens  we shallbe divided into light and dark countries.Regrettably  in the past 30 years  no effectivemeasure has been implemented to facilitate theexercise of the legally recognized right of NPT Statesparties to have access to and to use peaceful nuclearenergy in accordance with article IV. Therefore  theGeneral Assembly should ask the International AtomicEnergy Agency - in accordance with article II of itsStatute - to report on violations by specific countriesthat have hindered the implementation of the abovearticle and also to produce practical strategies for itsrenewed implementation.It is particularly important to note that thepeaceful use of nuclear energy without possession ofthe nuclear fuel cycle is an empty proposition.Countries and peoples that rely for their fuel oncoercive powers and stop at nothing to further theirinterests may indeed become totally dependent onnuclear power plants. No popularly elected responsible Government would consider such asituation to be in the interest of its people. The historyof dependence on oil in oil-rich countries underdomination is an experience that no independentcountry would be willing to repeat.Those hegemonic Powers that consider thescientific and technological progress of independentand free nations to be a challenge to their monopoly onthose important instruments of power and which do notwant to see such achievements in other countries  havemisrepresented Iranís healthy and fully safeguardedtechnological endeavours in the nuclear field as apursuit of nuclear weapons. That is nothing but apropaganda ploy. The Islamic Republic of Iran ispresenting in good faith its proposal for constructiveinteraction and a just dialogue. However  if some try toimpose their will on the Iranian people by resorting toa language of force and threats against Iran  we willreconsider our entire approach to the nuclear issue.Allow me  as the elected President of the Iranianpeople  to outline the other main elements of mycountryís initiative regarding the nuclear issue.First  the Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirms itspreviously and repeatedly stated position that  inaccordance with our religious principles  the pursuit ofnuclear weapons is prohibited.Secondly  the Islamic Republic of Iran believesthat it is necessary to revitalize the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and  as Iproposed earlier  to create an ad hoc committee tocombat nuclear weapons and abolish the apartheid thatexists in the field of peaceful nuclear technology.Thirdly  the fuel cycle of the Islamic Republic ofIran is not technically different from that of othercountries that have peaceful nuclear technology.Therefore  as a further confidence-building measureand in order to provide the greatest degree oftransparency  the Islamic Republic of Iran is preparedto engage in serious partnerships with the private andpublic sectors of other countries in the implementationof a uranium enrichment programme in Iran. Thatrepresents the most far-reaching step - beyond allrequirements of the NPT - proposed by Iran as afurther confidence-building measure.Fourthly  in keeping with Iranís inalienable rightto have access to a nuclear fuel cycle  continuedinteraction and technical and legal cooperation with theInternational Atomic Energy Agency will be thecentrepiece of our nuclear policy. The initiation and thecontinuation of negotiations with other countries willbe carried out in the context of Iranís interaction withthe Agency. With that in mind  I have directed therelevant Iranian officials to compile the legal andtechnical details of Iranís nuclear approach  based onthe following considerations.First  international precedent tells us that nuclearfuel delivery contracts are unreliable  and no legallybinding international document or instrument exists toguarantee the delivery of nuclear fuel. On manyoccasions such bilateral contracts have either beensuspended or stopped altogether for political reasons.Therefore  the Islamic Republic of Iran  in its pursuitof peaceful nuclear technology  considers it to bewithin its legitimate rights to receive objectiveguarantees for uranium enrichment in the nuclear fuelcycle.9Secondly  in its negotiations with the EuropeanUnion three  Iran has tried in earnest to demonstratethe solid and legitimate foundations of its nuclearactivity in the context of the NPT and to establishmutual trust. The selection of our negotiating partnersand the continuation of negotiations with the EuropeanUnion three will be commensurate with therequirements of our cooperation with the Agencyregarding the non-diversion of the process of uraniumenrichment to non-peaceful purposes  within theframework of the NPT. In that context  severalproposals have been presented that can be consideredin the context of the negotiations.Thirdly  the discriminatory approach with respectto the NPT  focusing on the obligations of Statesparties while disregarding their rights under the Treaty should cease.As the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran  Iassure the Assembly that my country will doeverything in its power to contribute to globaltranquillity and peace  based on the two values ofspirituality and justice  and on the principle of equalrights of all peoples and nations. My country willinteract and cooperate constructively with theinternational community to face the challenges beforeus.From the beginning of time  humanity has longedfor the day when justice  peace  equality andcompassion would envelop the world. All of us cancontribute to the establishment of such a world. Whenthat day comes  the ultimate promise of all divinereligions will be fulfilled with the emergence of aperfect human being who is heir to all prophets andpious men. He will lead the world to justice andabsolute peace.Almighty Lord  I pray to you to hasten theappearance of your last repository - the promised one that perfect and pure human being  the one who willfill this world with justice and peace. O Lord  includeus among his companions  followers and those whoserve his cause."

I come from a rich and36fertile land which has throughout its honourable pastgiven the blood of its children  such as Al-Hussein andsubsequently Al-Sadr  to protect freedom and humanrights.This is a unique opportunity for me to makeheard the strong voice of Iraq. The dictatorship thatruled Iraq in the past tried to silence that voice bysowing death and destruction. Mass graves testify tothat. Today it is the terrorists who are trying to silencethat voice. I have come here to deliver to the Assemblya message from my nation  to convey the real pictureof the new Iraq that is emerging  the power of itsdetermination and its profound love and feelingstowards all other nations.Iraq is now dealing with various new realities.Today ó released from the restraints of a 35-yeardictatorship that imposed on Iraq one political security  media and economic option and engendered areal Calvary of suffering for its people ó Iraq iswitnessing a different  multifaceted reality. Throughoutthat period of great suffering and while the world stoodidly by  all kinds of crimes and suppression werecommitted against Iraqis  Iraqi wealth and resources the environment  education  the justice system  cultureand civilization.With the recent successful conclusion of ourpolitical journey - in record time and in spite of allthe obstacles and challenges facing it - the Iraqipeople can justly be proud of their country and identitytoday. Beginning with the elections on 30 January 2005and the formation of the Government on 3 May  anddespite all the challenges faced over the past threemonths  a draft constitution was written and will bepresented to the Iraqi people for a vote on 15 October.That referendum will allow the Iraqi people to expressits will and allow it to constitutionally establish therule of law and to create a State in which there isequality for all Iraqis.The constitution will allow law and order  justiceand equality for all Iraqis. Iraqi women will be able toparticipate actively in political life and will have theirrights restored  including the same right that men haveto pass on their nationality to their children. Theconstitution grants religious freedom  freedom ofspeech  and the right to federal and regional autonomy.We are marching resolutely towards politicalstability and economic prosperity and regainingsecurity and stability. While there were 61 terrorist carbombings in July  that number dropped to nine inAugust and September. Likewise  the number ofassassinations decreased from 225 to nine in the pasttwo months.On 9 September the Iraqi military attackedterrorist hubs in Talafar to restore security and stabilitythere. Our forces adhered to strict rules of conduct doing their best to protect innocent civilians in thattown. Feeling the force of that operation  the terroristsfled to commit more crimes ó this time in the braveand heroic city of Khadimiya  where over 160 civilianswere killed on 14 September.The Iraqi forces continue to build  to train and tobe equipped so that they can take control of all internalsecurity matters and do not have to depend on themultinational forces for their security. However  eventhough some Iraqi cities are already prepared for it  thetime has not come for the Iraqi forces to be completelyindependent. When we are ready and self-sufficient  wewill ask the multinational forces to leave our cities.The new political life in Iraq is committed tofreedom of the press  freedom of expression  theseparation of the legislative  executive  and judiciarypowers and the reconstruction of Iraq  as well as torealize the aspirations of the Iraqi people todevelopment and progress. Oil production and exportshave increased along with the number of employmentopportunities  income and trade exchange for Iraqis.More is being accomplished in public services and inhealth care and ambitious projects are under way toreconstruct our infrastructure  especially in the areas ofhome and road construction. Environmental bureauxhave now declared the Iraqi provinces to be free fromradioactivity.I therefore seize this opportunity to urge creditornations to help us by cancelling Iraqi debt or loans.That debt was accumulated under the corrupt policiesof the previous regime and the Iraqi people have hadno hand in it.For Iraq to recover its role in the internationalcommunity and to participate effectively in defendinginternational peace and security and to combat the evilscourge of terrorism  it must be allowed to rebuild andto implement plans for the development  rehabilitationand the rebuilding of its infrastructure. I call on thedonor countries to meet their commitments undertakenat different international conferences  including in37Madrid  Brussels and  most recently  Jordan  to providefinancial aid to Iraq.Iraq would like to pay tribute to the constructiverole of the United Nations in its special efforts to helpthe Iraqi people through the special envoy of theSecretary-General and the technical election assistanceteam. While we highly appreciate those efforts  we arealso looking forward to having the United Nationsreturn to Iraq and reopen its offices and agencies inorder to support the reconstruction and developmentprocess.We also call upon the international community toevaluate the need to adopt an international programmeto protect and preserve the fine cultural andarchaeological heritage and shrines of Iraq  whosecities are steeped in history  from Sumer and Babylonto the present.Today  Iraq is both a witness to and a victim ofthe cruel  vicious and merciless attacks of internationalterrorists  who began their global campaign on11 September 2001. Alarm bells are ringing in differentcapitals around the world ó in Spain  Britain  Turkey Egypt  Jordan  Lebanon  and Saudi Arabia - as wehave all witnessed. Iraq was afflicted with that scourgeunder Saddamís regime  whose policy was to rule ordestroy people and property with all types of lethalweapons. Today the Iraqi people are paying the price ofcountering terrorism  because it is their homes that areon the frontlines of the battle. The world must supportIraqis in fighting the war against terrorism and theremnants of the Baath regime so that it can movetowards democracy.In order to deal effectively and radically withterrorism  we must agree on a definition of a number ofelements that are closely related to it  including suicideand the culture of terrorism  the financing of terrorism advocacy and propaganda that attempt to legitimizeterrorism  perpetrators of terrorist acts and Stateterrorism.No country is free of terrorism today. Anycountry can be a victim of terrorism at any time. We allface this common threat. It brooks no boundaries; thegeography of terrorism envelopes all humanity. Wemust therefore lend a hand to those who are paying theprice of terrorism and to its victims. Because of theinterdependence of nations  what happens in onecountry cannot fail to have repercussions in others.There is also a need to draw a distinction betweennatural disasters and terrorist disasters caused by man.The former are often uncontrollable. When they occurthe entire world mobilizes to provide assistance to theaffected countries  as we witnessed in the case of lastDecemberís Asian tsunami and the recent HurricaneKatrina in Louisiana. But the calamities of terrorism  ifallowed  will be as devastating as natural disasters. Weneed to raise awareness and work together to put anend to terrorism and to alleviate its destructive impact.In this regard  we want to express our warmestthanks to the people of the United States and to all theother peoples who have supported us. We must joinefforts to triumph over terrorism  because those whowin this victory will be able to help others as well. TheIraqi people are in the forefront of the counter-terrorism struggle. Why do those countries that sendsuicide bombers not send their young people to dohumanitarian work to contribute to the reconstructionof Iraq instead of sending them to kill children  todestabilize Iraq and its security? Why do they not sendfunds to invest in Iraq  so that the common interests ofour peoples and theirs may be achieved and so that thestay of the multinational forces may be shortened?Why do the news agencies in these countries not relaythe achievements of the new Iraq and convey the realpicture of the terrorist offensive  which targets popularmarkets and civilian gatherings  instead of incitingmedia reports that distort facts and falsify realities?But prior to that  we call upon neighbouring countriesto stand by our people and prevent terrorists fromentering Iraq  and to commit themselves to protectingour common borders for the safety and well-being ofour peoples. We seek to establish the best possiblerelations with all countries  especially neighbouringones  in order to promote the best interests of all and tosafeguard national sovereignty and protect it from anyforeign interference.I would like now to touch on the most importantpolitical problems and the need for these problems tobe resolved peacefully in accordance with internationalagreements and treaties. We call for a fair and justsolution to the political problems in the Middle East and in particular the Palestinian question  so that thisregion and all regions of the world will be free fromweapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons. Wealso must affirm the legitimate right of the Palestinianpeople to establish a sovereign State  ensuring them alife of dignity lived in freedom in a climate of peace intheir own territory. We must all work to spread the38culture of love  peace and coexistence instead of theculture of hatred  war  vindictiveness and terrorism.Iraq  whose children aspire to political economic  security and developmental reconstruction wants fully to assume its responsibility  both regionaland international  to safeguard peace and securitythroughout the region and in the world. Iraq paystribute to the United Nations  which has provided theworld with a broad umbrella to prevent wars andresolve conflicts. The world today is constantlychanging  and this requires dynamic changes in thestructure  decision-making and working methods of theUnited Nations so it can cope with new world realitiesand meet its obligations. Iraq is undergoing difficulttimes  but its aspirations are just and we therefore hopethat you will give Iraq your support and that you willdisplay solidarity with Iraq  especially as we are on theverge of adopting our permanent constitution  aconstitution that can ensure independence and a life ofdemocracy  coexistence  love and tolerance for all."
"79",3401,"ISL",60,2005,"I would like to join thosewho have expressed thanks to the Secretary-Generalfor his efforts in recent years to address the veryserious issues facing the international community.Iceland had high expectations for the results oflast week’s summit  which were met only partly in itsoutcome document (resolution 60/1). Much furtherwork is needed. While most of the key values in theCharter were reaffirmed  it is Iceland’s view thathuman rights and the accountability of States to theircitizens were insufficiently dealt with.The United Nations Charter guarantees equalityamong nations and provides a basis on which they canlive together as good neighbours. However  the Charternot only addresses how relations should be conductedamong Governments; it also specifies howGovernments should conduct themselves towards theirpeoples. That is what the Secretary-General has calledthe accountability of States to their citizens.Iceland supports the Secretary-General’s strongstatement on the responsibility borne by theinternational community in cases of massive humanrights abuses or genocide. The United Nations hasmade significant progress in that respect by recognizingthe existence of an international responsibility to protect.The Security Council and other institutions have thusbeen given a clear mandate — indeed  a clear duty —to act where crimes against humanity are committed.6Democracy and respect for universal humanrights are of central importance to security anddevelopment. Iceland supports the establishment of theUnited Nations Democracy Fund and will contribute toit. We are also strongly in favour of reforming thepresent human rights machinery. The Commission onHuman Rights is dysfunctional and devoid ofcredibility; deliberations on human rights have sufferedaccordingly. Moreover  the credibility of the entireUnited Nations Organization is threatened. There nowexists a summit mandate to establish a Human RightsCouncil  which will be responsible for promotinguniversal respect for the protection of all human rightsand fundamental freedoms. For Iceland  the idealHuman Rights Council would be smaller than theCommission and would be in session all year so that itcould respond to emergencies. The composition of thenew Council will be fundamental to its effectiveness. Itmust not include major human rights abusers.At the summit  Member States committedthemselves to making every possible effort to concludea comprehensive convention on international terrorism.Such a convention must unconditionally condemnterrorism. If it is to be fully effective  it must include alegal definition of terrorist acts.Unfortunately  the threat of terrorism  combinedwith that of weapons of mass destruction  is not dealtwith in the outcome document  which fails to addressthe proliferation of such weapons. Proliferation is aprofound danger which the United Nations cannotignore but must confront in a decisive manner.Iceland welcomes the emphasis placed by thedocument on investing in prevention  peacemaking peacekeeping and peacebuilding. We welcome inparticular the proposal to create a PeacebuildingCommission and a Support Office within theSecretariat. Iceland is willing to take part  along withother Member States  in ensuring that both are up andrunning by the end of the year.I must express disappointment at the fact that thegroup of four proposal for reforming the SecurityCouncil has not yet received the support it deserves.While not perfect  it remains the most practical basisfor reforming the Council. That approach thereforecontinues to have Iceland’s firm support. The Councilmust reflect the world as it is and be representative.Iceland has previously  in this very forum  expressedits interest in participating actively in the work of theCouncil in the years 2009 and 2010.The Millennium Declaration provides a platformto address poverty in the developing countries.Developed countries have committed themselves toproviding the necessary support in the form of officialdevelopment assistance. It is no less important fordeveloping countries to create a transparent andaccountable environment that respects goodgovernance and the rule of law  in order to attractdomestic and foreign investment  which fosters thegrowth of a vibrant private sector. It is also importantfor developed and developing countries to ensure asuccessful outcome of the current World TradeOrganization negotiations.The Government of Iceland has acknowledgedthe great challenge posed by the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Accordingly  it will continuesubstantially to increase Iceland’s official developmentassistance in the coming years.Iceland is committed to reform of the UnitedNations and to finding common ways of dealing withthreats to international security. The outcomedocument has serious shortcomings  and the riskremains that the United Nations could be furtherweakened. Member States must ensure that the processcontinues and that it will  in the coming weeks andmonths  deliver on the fundamental issues at hand inthe interests of peace and prosperity in the world."
"80",3448,"ISR",60,2005,"It is my unique pleasure topraise His Excellency Ambassador Dan Gillerman  myemissary to the United Nations  who is in the Chair atpresent  upon his election to the post of Vice-Presidentat this session of the General Assembly  and to wishhim much success.These are optimistic times in the Middle East.The iron wall that has defined Israel's relations withmost of the Arab and Muslim world for generations  iscoming down. Israel's contacts with Arab and MuslimStates are growing at a rate never seen before.Countries like Pakistan and others that in the pastrefused to acknowledge our shared humanity  todayextend their hands in friendship and recognition.Relations with key Muslim States  such as Turkey  areflourishing  while our peaceful ties with both Egyptand Jordan are constantly improving.Here in New York this week  I have had thehonour of meeting with more than 10 of my colleaguesfrom the Arab and Muslim world - a numberunthinkable just two years ago. Those meetings havebeen friendly  as is only fitting for countries that arenot in conflict - either territorially  or economically.Israel welcomes this new readiness for contact  and weencourage our neighbours to build on the foundationsthat we are now laying. Contacts between Israel and itsArab and Muslim neighbours are good for the region and good for peace.We all share a common interest in building aregion of tolerance and cooperation - a region wherethe moderates have the initiative  not the extremists whose violence has set the agenda for so long. Indeed those who genuinely wish to help the Palestinians andto bring them the benefits of peace and prosperity mustrealize that building contacts and cooperation withIsrael is a crucial element in that process.Possibilities for cooperation abound. In fields asdiverse as agriculture  health  the environment transportation and electricity  the potential benefits ofMiddle East regional cooperation are immense. Suchcooperation can bring tangible and immediateeconomic benefits  as Israel's improving relations withJordan and Egypt have shown.Unfortunately  many of our ties with the Arab andMuslim world are still deep in the shadows  hiddenfrom the public eye. Today  I call on my Arab andMuslim colleagues to bring our contacts out into thelight of day  so that our peoples may understand our8shared desire to work with each other to bring peaceand prosperity to our region. I call on the leaders of theArab and Muslim world  to join us in speaking to ourpopulations of peace rather than conflict  of reasons tocooperate  rather than reasons to boycott.In November of this year  I will sit alongside myArab and Muslim colleagues at two internationalgatherings: the World Summit on the InformationSociety  in Tunisia; and the summit of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership  in Barcelona. I call uponthe international community and my Arab and Muslimcounterparts to work together with us to ensure thatthose meetings result in concrete projects that will helpreinforce our peace efforts on the ground.This is also the time for the internationalcommunity to renew its investment in the future of theMiddle East by reviving the multilateral track of theMiddle East peace talks.Just one week ago  Israel completed theevacuation of all Israeli communities in the Gaza Strip.Entire families - many of whom had lived and tilledthose lands for three generations - were called uponby their Government to leave and to begin their livesanew. Today  there are no more Israelis in Gaza. Israelimilitary rule is now over. Responsibility for the affairsof Gaza and its residents is now in Palestinian hands.Israel's actions have opened the door to a new future and we invite our neighbours to walk with us togetherthrough that door.We are committed to the road map  and we wishto get back to its full implementation. To do that  weneed a partner. A partner who is committed  as we are to the peaceful resolution of our differences  and to thedemocratic and universal principles on which peace isfounded.Israel attaches great importance to the Palestinianassumption of responsibility. In it lies the key toprogress towards peace. The transfer of responsibilityfor Gaza provides the Palestinian side with the chanceto take their fate into their own hands; an opportunitynot just to say that they want to govern  but to showthat they are ready and able to do so. Gaza  we hope  willserve as a model for how the Palestinian Authority canbuild a functioning  democratic and peaceful society.Recognizing the significance of this moment Israel is taking great pains to ensure that Palestinianleader Mahmoud Abbas is given every opportunity toestablish his authority. We want to promote conditionsthat will benefit ordinary Palestinians  without posing asecurity threat to Israel.Israel has expressed its strong support forinternational aid and assistance for the social andeconomic development of Gaza  and we are committedto facilitating those efforts. Constructive internationalengagement is crucial to the Palestinian Authority'ssuccess. The international community's priority nowmust be ensuring that the Palestinian Authority and itsinstitutions can deliver the services and outcomes theirpeople and ours expect and deserve.Economic reconstruction  of course  is notenough. The Palestinian Authority must also deliver onits commitment to end the campaign of terror againstIsrael. For Israel  security is an issue on which we willnever compromise. We insist on the end of terror andthe dismantlement of its infrastructure  for the safety ofour citizens  and so that our peace efforts can succeed.Turning Gaza into a model of success requiresthat the Palestinian Authority act to promote andprotect democracy from its enemies. Here  as withsecurity  there is no room for discounts. Simplyholding elections is no guarantee of moderation andresponsible government.Two days ago in Gaza  the terrorist organizationHamas held a rally of 10 000 armed men dedicated to aholy war against Israel. Like Al-Qaida and the otherorganizations in the global network of terror  Hamasseeks to destroy everything that the internationalcommunity and the moderates in our region seek tobuild: tolerance  democracy and peace. Hamas isresponsible for the deliberate murder of hundreds ofIsraeli civilians  amongst them scores of women andchildren. Israel cannot and will not grant legitimacy tosuch an organization. We will not cooperate with itsdesire to participate in the forthcoming Palestinianelections. And we call on the international communityto make clear its own opposition to the inclusion ofsuch terrorists in the democratic process. If Gaza isindeed to be the positive model we all wish to see  thenit is those who promote dialogue  not violence  whomust be empowered.The central threat to global security and torenewed momentum towards dialogue and peace in theMiddle East today is Iran and its nuclear ambitions. Asthe speech before this Assembly by the newly electedpresident of Iran so clearly demonstrated  Iran's fanaticregime remains determined to proceed with its nuclearweapons programme. Israel welcomes the efforts of theinternational community - in particular France  Britainand Germany  backed by the United States - to deny Iranthe ability to terrorize the world with nuclear weapons.The Board of Governors of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency is meeting at this very momentin Vienna to discuss this urgent matter. I call on themto stop this evil regime from acquiring nuclearweapons. The security and stability of the entire globeis at stake. This is why it is essential and urgent thatthe Security Council take action. The internationalcommunity must rally as one and use all the means atits disposal to stop Iran before it goes nuclear. We mustnot allow the fate of mankind to rest in the hands of thetyrants of Tehran.In January of this year  this Assembly convenedin special session to commemorate the Holocaust andpay tribute to the brave soldiers and nations who freedEuropean Jewry and the world from the calamity ofthat darkest nightmare. Israel commends thecommunity of nations for standing up in unison on thisanniversary in commitment to the cry ""never again"".We commend the Secretary-General's and thisAssembly's recognition that Holocaust remembrancemust be a universal commitment. Ultimately  it is onlythe determined defence of the universal values oftolerance and the sanctity of each human life that willprotect us from tyranny and extremism.In this spirit  Israel calls on the GeneralAssembly to adopt a resolution initiated by Israel andother like-minded countries commemorating theHolocaust and calling for global educational efforts toensure that its lessons are learnt. Especially today  theday the world's greatest Nazi-hunter  SimonWiesenthal  has passed away  we are reminded that theHolocaust is passing from human memory to history.As the generation of survivors leaves us  who will telltheir story  if not us?The special session to commemorate theHolocaust is only one example  of the welcome shift inthe attitude of this institution towards Israel. Our recentelection as Vice-President of this Assembly is another.I wish to commend the Secretary-General for hisunique contribution to this positive trend. Israel'srelations with the United Nations are better today thanthey have ever been. Nevertheless  they are still farfrom what they should be.I call on all the States gathered here to examinehow they too can contribute to promoting a morebalanced and constructive United Nations approach toIsrael. The United Nations cannot be true to its ownlofty and universal principles  if it continues to wastescarce resources and serve as a forum of hostility andprejudice against one of its own.The United Nations was born of the noble visionto bring the ideals of peace  security and human rightsto all peoples. Sadly  reality of the United Nationsremains far removed from the United Nations ideal.Major reform is urgent and crucial. Israel joins ourfellow Member States and their peoples in the desire tosee the United Nations fulfil the vision of its founders;to see the United Nations serving as a force for good inmeeting the many challenges of our age.Israel seeks to take its rightful place as a countrywith full and equal rights in this institution. We seek torealize our full potential to contribute to the globalagenda. This is why I have decided to present for thefirst time Israel's candidacy for membership on theSecurity Council.It was the wisest leader of ancient Israel  KingSolomon  who wrote  in the book of Ecclesiastes  ""Foreverything there is a season: a time to weep and a timeto laugh; ... a time to love and a time to hate; a timefor war and a time for peace."" This is a time for peace.A time for the leaders of the world to work together tobring the blessings of opportunity  peace and prosperityto all humanity.As the Jewish New Year dawns upon us  I extendon behalf of the Jewish people greetings of peace andbrotherhood to our Muslim and Arab neighbours and toall nations."
"81",3495,"ITA",60,2005,"Allow me atthe outset to express my heartfelt congratulations toyou  Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixtieth session. Your vast experiencein the international arena is the best guarantee ofsuccess for your mandate. My sincere thanks go also toyour predecessor  Jean Ping  who presided over thefifty-ninth session with particular effectiveness andskill.The deliberations of the High-level PlenaryMeeting represent an important and significant step inthe process of adapting the United Nations to theglobal challenges that it must address. The resultsachieved in the process of reforming the UnitedNations  its basic principles and its bodies reflect thebroadest consensus that could be mustered within theinternational community. Any attempt to reach formore would in all probability have meant jeopardizingits unity  which is an absolute and essential value. Weshould therefore rate those results highly and considerthem to be a call to action.Indeed  the heads of State or Government haveshown us the path to follow. It is now up to the GeneralAssembly and the Secretariat to set aboutimplementing the initiatives agreed upon in theoutcome document  improving and developing themwhere necessary.Recent events remind us  sometimes tragically  ofthe need for a multilateral system that has a solidstructure and can respond swiftly and effectively to themany challenges that individual members of theinternational community would never be able toaddress by themselves. Italy is convinced of this  andcommitment to multilateralism is a basic characteristicof our foreign policy.Of course  Italian support for the action ofinternational organizations is not based solely onabstract ideals. We support the principle  and especiallythe practice  of multilateralism because we areconvinced that common principles and  above all common interests justify the sharing of resources tools  responsibilities and benefits. Joint action isinconceivable without a shared perception of interests objectives and their priorities.Among the positive results of the High-levelPlenary Meeting is that it encouraged consensus on aninnovative and comprehensive vision of collectivesecurity and highlighted the main phenomenathreatening that security. Terrorism  underdevelopmentand fundamentalism are the primary threats  and ourresponse must be equal to the challenge; it can comeonly from a strong and credible multilateral system.In the light of the emergence of fundamentalistterrorism  the use of force by itself  althoughsometimes inevitable  is not enough. It is not throughweapons  but through political means  that we cancreate the conditions for a fruitful dialogue amongcultures  civilizations and religions and therebydevelop the social and international solidarity that canprevent terrorism from continuing its criminalproselytizing.9Global solidarity is also the most appropriateresponse to the scandal of global poverty  which resultsfrom the persistence of profound inequities in thedistribution of wealth — inequities that violate notonly every standard of fairness  but also the mostfundamental criteria of logic and effectiveness. Toeradicate underdevelopment  we must promote atangible solidarity that provides real and lastingbenefits by combining political and economic action onthe part of donor countries with the heightened sense ofresponsibility and autonomy that is developing inemerging countries as they yearn to shake off theculture of dependency.Underdevelopment and terrorism often findunifying elements — which increases the potential forinstability — in fundamentalism and ideologicalfanaticism  sworn enemies of universal values such asfreedom  peace and equality: values seen as a gravethreat by those who seek to control and delegitimizeour social systems.We firmly believe that the internationalcommunity must unite in the fight against terrorism underdevelopment and fundamentalism. This sessionof the General Assembly will have the task ofidentifying concrete initiatives and actions to that end.Italy’s steadfast commitment — even at the costof significant sacrifices — to promoting peace in keyareas of crisis such as the Middle East  the Balkans andDarfur; our assistance to countries  such asAfghanistan and Iraq  that are seeking to recover afterdecades of obscurantist oppression; our commitment tospreading a culture of freedom and dialogue amongcultures; and our front-line commitment to fighting thescourge of underdevelopment  including throughinnovative methods such as debt cancellation andparticipation in the Global Fund against the majorepidemics  are eloquent and material testimony to theseriousness of our intentions. In that regard  I wish tomention in particular our activities to promote thedevelopment of the African continent — activitiescarried out not only by way of anti-poverty initiatives but also by strengthening African capacities in theareas of conflict prevention  management andsettlement.We are prepared to meet the challenges before us which will entail the significant contribution ofmaterial and human resources that Italy is providingfor the functioning of the United Nations. It would notbe consistent with Italy’s attachment to multilateralismif I did not add that our efforts would be bound to failif they were carried out individually and not within amultilateral framework — hence our resolve tostrengthen multilateralism.The reform proposals introduced over the pastyear and submitted for the consideration of heads ofState or Government provide us with new andpotentially valuable tools that we must put to good use.I am thinking  for example  of the possibility ofsignificantly developing the international community’scapacity to prevent crisis situations  manage conflictsand modernize the modalities and contents oftraditional development assistance programmes inorder to promote lasting stability.That is why Italy cannot but favour the prospectof developing or inventing tools for communal actionin those areas by creating new bodies such as thePeacebuilding Commission and the Human RightsCouncil. Their creation will make it possible tooperationalize the desired integrated approach to crisismanagement and management of peacekeepingoperations — an approach that promises to reduce therecurrence of conflicts  consolidate peace processes incrisis regions and promote the restoration of rule-of-law infrastructures.The reform process under way can and mustinvest in United Nations institutions in their entirety with regard to both their composition and workingmethods  in order to strengthen effectiveness  while atthe same time ensuring the coherence and balance ofthe Organization’s general framework. Italy is fullyaware and convinced of this. We are also convinced ofthe need — especially in this area — to proceed withdue attention to individual sensitivities  within theframework of a process that ensures transparency andinclusiveness.At the summit  it was not possible to reach anagreement on the rather controversial subject ofSecurity Council reform  whose various aspects already widely debated in the preparatory phase  arewell known. Also well known is the position of Italyand of countries that  like us  belong to the “Unitingfor consensus” group. We presented a proposal aimedat greater inclusion  greater effectiveness and increaseddemocratic participation  having broad geographic andregional representation and elaborated in a constructiveand flexible spirit.10We are well aware that the priorities of othercountries are different  and we obviously respect theirpositions  although we do not share them. It is ourfervent hope that everyone will be convinced thatSecurity Council reform cannot be the result of showsof force  unacceptable conditions or artificialaccelerations aimed at creating new positions ofprivilege. Awareness of the need to reform the Councilis the common heritage of all Members. Such reformcertainly cannot be considered the exclusiveprerogative of those who advocate one reform optionas opposed to another. Recent events havedemonstrated that none of the proposals currently onthe table has the votes needed for adoption.Undoubtedly  none of them enjoys the broad consensusessential to ensure that the future shape of the SecurityCouncil will help unite  and not divide  theinternational community. This is why we firmly believethat it is necessary to turn the page in order to uniteefforts to seek new consensus formulas  both in termsof substance and in terms of method.It is clear that this quest cannot go on forever.Travelling this road together with trust andperseverance is the only way to ensure effective andlasting outcomes. Italy is prepared to consider  in aconstructive spirit  any potential solution that willgarner the broadest consensus possible  but willcontinue to oppose — in accordance with the principlesshared by a growing number of Member States — anyformulas that could create new divisions andmarginalization. Given the challenges it must face  theinternational community needs to be united in itsintentions.I know quite well that in these statements  theadjective “historic” is used so often that it loses muchof its meaning. Nevertheless  when we think about thetimetables and the risks or opportunities that areemerging  describing the moment of this GeneralAssembly as historic does not seem an exaggeration. Awell-known aphorism reminds us that those who do notremember history are condemned to repeat it. Historyteaches us that a united international community basedon the recognition of shared principles and basicinterests is the necessary condition for ensuring peace development and progress for our peoples."
"82",3541,"JAM",60,2005,"I would like tocongratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of thepresidency of the current session of the GeneralAssembly. May I also express our deep appreciation toMr. Jean Ping for so ably guiding the work of theGeneral Assembly during its fifty-ninth session.I am honoured to address the General Assemblytoday in my capacity as Chairman of the Group of 77and China. Five years ago  I was among the leaders ofnations  rich and poor  who met here under the auspicesof the United Nations and made a compact to rid theworld of the most dehumanizing conditions afflicting a24large portion of humankind. That was a solemn pledgemade by us to the most disadvantaged peoples of ourworld — the poor  the hungry  the illiterate  thehomeless  the sick — to infants  mothers and theunborn  as well as to nature  which must sustain theexistence of the whole human race.This year’s Human Development Report of theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP)reveals that one fifth of humanity survives on less than$1 per day  and that 2.5 billion people fail to earn $2daily. The recently concluded High-level PlenaryMeeting has revealed that we have made slightprogress  more so in a few regions  to meet some of theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). But we arenowhere on track to achieving the promises of any ofthe major development-oriented United Nationsconferences or summits held since the adoption of theMDGs. Progress has been uneven. At the current pace some regions and countries will miss several of theMDGs by decades. In certain areas  such as theelimination of hunger  we could be centuries away.We are likely to miss global targets in the areas ofinfant and maternal mortality  HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis malaria and other infectious diseases andenvironmental sustainability. Limited financialresources  debt  restricted asymmetrical tradeopportunities and HIV/AIDS have been identified asmajor inhibiting factors. Beyond those constraints during the past five years many developing countrieshave suffered devastating natural disasters  which havedisrupted economic growth  damaged production destroyed infrastructure and dislocated populations causing economic losses that amount to years of grossdomestic product (GDP). Development goals andtargets cannot be met within the time frames without amassive addition of resources  both financial andtechnical. No one can remain safe and secure  or evencontent  while living in an oasis of wealth surroundedby a desert of poverty.Not to be forgotten is the unfulfilled agenda ofgender equity. The empowerment of women must be avital ingredient in all our social and economicprogrammes.We agreed at Monterrey on a comprehensiveapproach to mobilize the financing needed for realglobal development that specified the contributionsrequired from developing and developed countriesalike. Our review has revealed that  as a group developing countries have delivered on theircommitments. Most have achieved a level of economicgrowth and have increased domestic resources andforeign-exchange reserves. There has been astrengthened focus on South/South cooperation  whichhas seen trade among developing countries growingfaster than their total export trade and an increasingflow of investment.At the second South-South Summit  held in Qatarin June  we agreed on a major programme ofSouth/South cooperation that is already having results.I shall cite just two examples. First  the Governmentsof Qatar  China and India pledged donations at theSummit to launch a South fund for development andhumanitarian assistance. Secondly  last week atMontego Bay  Jamaica  the President of the BolivarianRepublic of Venezuela signed  with several CaribbeanGovernments  the Petrocaribe Energy CooperationAgreement to enhance energy security  facilitate socio-economic development and advance regional economicintegration in the Caribbean. This is a most positiveinitiative at a time of high and volatile energy pricesand insecure supplies.From our partners in the developed world therehas been a gradual recovery of private foreign directinvestment and in the provision of official developmentassistance (ODA). We welcome the increase in debtrelief  including debt cancellation  for many of themost highly indebted poor countries  as well as therenewed focus on Africa and on HIV/AIDS.However  the review has also revealed sometrends that are cause for anxiety  and therefore worthyof our attention. First  a significant part of theresources mobilized by developing countries has beenused to finance debt-servicing payments to multilateraldevelopment banks and to increase foreign-exchangereserves held in developed countries. That has led tonet transfers to developed countries every year since1998. Secondly  foreign direct investment has beenconcentrated in  and is becoming almost confined to the larger  faster-growing developing countries.Thirdly  the increase in ODA since 2000 has largelybeen the result of resources targeted for emergencyassistance  debt relief and technical assistance.Together they accounted for 50 cents of every aiddollar in 2004. Fourthly  debt relief has been limited tothose highly indebted poor countries which havesatisfied International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditionsfor disbursements. Fifthly  the terms of trade continue25to work against commodity- and preference-dependentdeveloping countries. And sixthly  the sudden erosionof trade preferences has created significant economichardships for many developing countries without theresources or time to diversify their export base. The netresult is that there have been insufficient new resourcesavailable to the vast majority of developing countriesto invest in meeting long-term development goals.Policy space for developing countries to acteffectively and the timing and quality of the resourceflows are also very important. In this regard  the Groupof 77 and China calls for the elimination of aidconditionalities which restrict the policy options fordeveloping countries and thereby the real effectivenessof development cooperation.Further  we stress the need to cease the use ofunilateral coercive measures against developingcountries. It is wrong to apply the weight of economicpower to pressure developing countries for politicalpurposes. This causes severe hardships and jeopardizesdevelopment efforts  including the achievement of theMillennium Development Goals.There are developing countries which facepeculiar  if not unique  development challenges. TheGroup of 77 and China has consistently argued thatAfrica  the least developed countries  the landlockeddeveloping countries and the small island developingStates face special and tremendous challenges. Theseare magnified in a globalized  liberalized andcompetitive international economic environment andwith the increasing incidence of more devastatingnatural disasters.The arguments are gaining acceptance. There arenow internationally agreed programmes for the lastthree named groups and an emerging consensus for aspecial programme for Africa under Africanleadership. The special programmes for these groups ofcountries were reaffirmed at our High-level PlenaryMeeting. We now need to implement them withurgency.We have long recognized that export trade is themost sustainable source of resources for developmentas well as the best stimulant to investment andemployment. The current international trading rulesand systems are heavily stacked against developingcountries. We must resolve to transform internationaltrade into an engine of growth. The policies  rules andmodalities of global trade must have developmentfocus. Why have we failed so miserably to fulfil theDoha mandate for a development round? We sent onlythe feeblest of messages from the High-level PlenaryMeeting to our trade ministers  but unless they aregiven firm instructions to afford special and differentialtreatment to developing countries  the DecemberMinisterial Conference of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) in Hong Kong will  like thoseheld in Seattle and Cancun  yield a dismal collapse.We agreed in Monterrey that it was necessary toreform the international economic system and make itmore coherent and supportive of the developmentpolicies of Member States. We also agreed that it wasnecessary to increase the voice and participation ofdeveloping countries in the international financial andtrade institutions. Yet nothing has happened. We cannotallow the Bretton Woods institutions to remain foreverimpervious to our calls. To attain the agreeddevelopment objectives  there must be a renunciationof the ill-conceived policies imposed on a number ofdeveloping countries under structural adjustmentprogrammes begun three decades ago.We might dispute the causes and the sharing ofresponsibility  but no longer do we dispute theawesome reality of climate change. The evidence thatclimate change poses a long-term challenge to everypart of the globe is irrefutable.Developing countries have maintained thatclimate change and other unsustainable pressures onour environment demand urgent attention. Developedcountries must take the lead in changing productionand consumption patterns: in an approach to thedevelopment and transfer of environmentally soundtechnology to developing countries on a preferentialbasis; in their level of commitment and support to fightagainst desertification and land degradation; and in theresources to be devoted to the management of wasteand in the change towards the promotion of a culture ofrecycling. We must keep on pressing for thedevelopment and adoption of strategies that mitigate and build resilience to  the impact of climate change.I have spoken thus far on development issues.But these are closely related to other critical areas ofthe international agenda. One such area is disarmamentand arms control  which is in danger of becoming aneglected and forgotten goal of the United Nations.The link between disarmament and development iseven more relevant today. The figures are indeed26startling. Roughly $1 trillion is now spent annually onweapons and military equipment of all kinds consuming a massive share of the world’s resources. Ifsuch resources were channelled into development  theworld would not only be more prosperous  it would bemuch safer and more secure.Our concern is not just about nuclear weapons. Itis also about the proliferation of guns of everydescription  which endangers the lives of ordinarycitizens  undermines the rule of law and threatenssocial stability. Those who manufacture such weaponsmust exercise greater control and support anti-proliferation efforts.The United Nations was established 60 years agoto bring peace and security to the world  and also toplay a major role in promoting development. TheUnited Nations must not allow  as has appeared to bethe case in recent years  any part of its mandate to beusurped.The Bretton Woods institutions and the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade  now the World TradeOrganization  have taken dominant positions onpolicies in areas of their specialization. These policies however  have far-ranging implications across theeconomic  social and environmental spectrum. There isa glaring gap in overall international developmentpolicymaking  and in the capacity to secure coherenceacross the development  finance  trade and technologyareas.With renewed priority to development and theMillennium Development Goals  United Nationsreform should empower the Organization by providingthe resources and a clear mandate to do at least threethings. First  it should ensure system-wide coherence including with the Bretton Woods institutions and theWTO  in respect to the policies and operationalactivities which impact the achievement of the agreeddevelopment goals. Secondly  it should bring theresources of the development-oriented arms of theUnited Nations system to focus on developmentpriorities that have been identified by Member States.And  thirdly  it should promote dialogue andpartnership  review trends  particularly in resourcemobilization  and implement measures to ensure thatthe Development Goals can be met within the agreedtime frames. These should be the responsibility of arevitalized Economic and Social Council.The future of generations to come rests not somuch on the vigour of our debate and the declarationsat the sixtieth session of the General Assembly  but onthe action we take  commencing right here in NewYork  to make the United Nations stronger and moreeffective.All our citizens are demanding that collectivelywe emerge with a clear vision  that we display thecourage and unrelenting commitment to build a worldof peace  justice and equity  which we can inhabittogether in true harmony. They are convinced that it iswithin our power to rid the only planet where humanlife prevails of hunger  ignorance  disease and strife.They believe we can provide shelter to the homelessand eradicate poverty everywhere; that once we havethe political will and determination  we can preventgenocide and combat terrorism; that irrespective ofgender  race  colour or religious creed  we can ensurefor every person the inalienable right of human dignity.Let us spare no effort to build a single world freefrom want and fear  free from exploitation andoppression: a mother Earth where justice  liberty prosperity and the wisdom of creative minds prevail inabundance. Let us here resolve to build one world inwhich every man  woman and child can realize the truepurpose of life and enjoy its fulfilment. Let usdetermine that the time for action is now and sound thetrumpet of hope for all mankind."
"83",3587,"JOR",60,2005,"Mr. President  allow me at the outset to congratulateyou warmly on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. I would alsolike to express my confidence that your well-knownwisdom and competence will contribute to enrichingand focusing the deliberations of this Assembly.Moreover  I would like to express my gratitude to yourpredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  for the strenuous efforts heexerted during the past session. I would especially liketo convey my appreciation to Secretary-General KofiAnnan for his notable efforts in advancing the reformprocess in the United Nations.From this rostrum  allow me to convey mycountry's solidarity with the people and Government ofthe United States of America for the tragedy that wasinflicted on certain regions and cities by HurricaneKatrina. I would like to extend our sincere condolencesto the families of the victims and our sympathy for thedestruction caused by the hurricane.Tackling the reform of the United Nationsrequires the objective recognition that theOrganization  since its establishment in 1945  hasachieved a large measure of success in the realizationof the purposes and principles of its Charter.Objectivity further requires the admission thatsubstantive and concrete changes have affected thecore of the international order and the network ofinternational relations; this has made it imperative toreview the role of the United Nations as a matter of areal and urgent international necessity. Such a reviewshould focus on a comprehensive revitalization of thisrole in order to enable the Organization to respond tosuch challenges and changes affecting the internationalsystem.The United Nations Charter is a document that iscapable of coping with international developments provided that Member States have the political will tointroduce the necessary reforms into the work of themain organs of the Organization. The reforms shouldensure that these bodies are able to fulfil the ambitionsof member States and  at the same time  provide theenvironment and mechanism necessary to guarantee thefaithful application of the Charter's provisions and theimplementation of resolutions adopted  particularlySecurity Council resolutions  without discrimination.In this context  we would like to welcome theresults of this year's world summit and the adoption ofthe outcome document  even though more could havebeen achieved in the document  particularly in relationto the renewal of the international community'scommitment to the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs). Nevertheless  we hope that the document willbe a starting point to development and reform  whichwe all hope to achieve  so that the United Nationsremains the cornerstone of the system of internationalrelations.While emphasizing the principles of the non-useof force in international relations and non-interferencein the internal affairs of States  we believe that theCharter's provisions  if applied  would respond to thenew and unconventional challenges that constitute apossible threat to international peace and security. TheSecurity Council can deal with such challengesappropriately and in a timely manner  if the will existsto do so  without exceeding its powers. This requiresthat serious consideration be given to revitalizing theCouncil's mechanisms in order to make them moredemocratic  transparent and representative. That  inturn  requires an expansion of both permanent andnon-permanent membership of the Council in a waythat reflects the current international situation and thesignificant increase in United Nations membership.In the context of reform  it is imperative tostrengthen the General Assembly and enhance its role which complements that of the Security Council in themaintenance of international peace and security. Therole of the General Assembly is central  since it is theorgan in which all United Nations Member States arerepresented. It is  therefore  capable of dealingeffectively with the requirements of enhancedmultilateral international cooperation and thedevelopment of the policies necessary for suchcooperation.18We support the development of the work of theEconomic and Social Council in order to resolveemerging economic  social and development challengesand problems. We would like to emphasize theCouncil's leading role in coordinating and guiding theinternational development process and promoting theachievement of the MDGs  which Member Statespledged to implement and fulfil by the year 2015.It is important to consider seriously the currentcoordination mechanisms with other internationalorganizations involved in development and theliberalization of world economy and trade. It is alsoimperative to consider the reduction of the debt ofdeveloping countries  in accordance with amethodology that helps to achieve sustainabledevelopment and bridge the widening gap betweendeveloped and developing countries.Moreover  this development methodology oughtto parallel commitments by States towards certain keyissues  such as the promotion of good governance respect for human rights and basic freedoms and thecombating of corruption. This is done through a reformprocess that should take into consideration theparticular cultural specificities of each State.Confronting the existing challenges and settlingconflicts requires us to emphasize the necessity torespect the rule of law and human rights.Combating international terrorism is a prioritythat requires the close cooperation of all on the basis ofthe principles mentioned earlier. The same can be saidof responses to acts of aggression against others  whichshould accord with existing commitments under theCharter  international law and Security Councilresolutions. To safeguard human rights  it is crucial torevitalize human rights mechanisms  promote theirwork and establish new machinery  including a HumanRights Council. In the same context  respect for therule of law requires that we address more seriouscrimes against the international community ó hencethe pivotal role of the International Criminal Court incombating war crimes  genocide and crimes againsthumanity. Moreover  the promotion of the rule of lawmakes it imperative to resort to the International Courtof Justice to settle disputes between States and torespect its decisions and advisory opinions.My country is committed to reform anddevelopment. We believe that the ideal paradigm forreform is one that comes from within and aims toenhance the protection of human rights and basicfreedoms  as well as expanding grass-rootsparticipation in national decision-making. Jordan is inthe process of launching a national agenda aimed atformulating a comprehensive reform methodology inthe political  economic and social areas over the next10 years. The agenda also aims to promote grass-rootsparticipation in political decision-making on the basisof a solid democratic choice.Any real reform and development in a State isaffected  positively or negatively  by the political andgeographical realities of the region. The pattern ofreform in Jordan and the Middle East will be moresustainable and progressive if the political settlementbased on the international terms of reference of thepeace process  the road map and the Arab peaceinitiative attains its goal of achieving a just  lasting andcomprehensive peace in the Middle East.Jordan welcomes the Israeli withdrawal from theGaza Strip and certain settlements in the northern WestBank. We stress that this withdrawal is not analternative to the road map but must be part of it  andthat both the Israeli and Palestinian sides must carryout their respective obligations under the road map aswell as the recent Sharm el-Sheikh Understandings. Inthat regard  we call upon Israel to withdraw its militaryforces from the Palestinian towns reoccupied inSeptember 2000 and to cease all forms of settlementactivity in the occupied West Bank  including EastJerusalem.We also call upon Israel to cease the constructionof the separation wall in the occupied Palestinianterritories and to demolish the segments that havealready been built in those territories. We call on it toreturn the property that was seized and to paycompensation for the damage incurred. Theconstruction of the wall along its current routeconstitutes a clear and continuous violation of theestablished norms of international law  including theright to self-determination  human rights principles andthe rules of international humanitarian law. That factwas emphasized by the International Court of Justice inits landmark advisory opinion on the subject.We also urge support for the Palestinian NationalAuthority in its genuine efforts to preserve the truceand to deal firmly with any violations of it or theceasefire. We call upon the international communityand the Quartet in particular to provide all possible19assistance to the Authority. We emphasize here that themost important outcome of the road map is theestablishment of an independent  viable PalestinianState that is geographically contiguous  with EastJerusalem as its capital  whose borders are based onthose existing before 5 June 1967.Moreover  we must create conditions conduciveto completing the peace process in order to achieve ajust and comprehensive peace in the Middle East  onthe basis of full Israeli withdrawal from all theoccupied Arab territories  including the Syrian GolanHeights  and to reach an agreed solution on the issue ofthe Palestinian refugees  based on General Assemblyresolution 194 (III). That should lead to theestablishment of normal relations between the ArabStates and Israel  in accordance with the Arab peaceinitiative and the international terms of reference of thepeace process.The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan rejects allforms and manifestations of terrorism  regardless ofjustifications. We stand together on the front lines  inword and deed  to eradicate that scourge  which hasafflicted the entire international community and left noone unscathed. My country also rejects all unjust andsuspicious attempts to tie that criminal phenomenon toa specific religion  culture or geographical region  andwe stand firm against any such attempt to tie it to theIslamic religion. Islam  in substance and practice  isbased on moderation and facilitation. It was a pioneerin promoting the protection of human rights andsafeguarding the life  dignity and property of persons.It rejects any infringement on these concepts  even intime of war. In that context  the Amman messagewould emphasize that this divine religion is beyondany suspicion linking its teachings to incitement toharm innocent human beings.Jordan welcomes the adoption of the Conventionon the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism andsupports the efforts under way to ensure the adoptionof the comprehensive convention to combat terrorism.We further endorse the proposal made by the Kingdomof Saudi Arabia to establish an international centre tocombat terrorism  which was adopted by the Counter-terrorism International Conference  held in SaudiArabia early this year.Jordan will continue to assist Iraq in overcomingits current crisis and in consolidating its safety andsecurity. We condemn all aspects and practices ofterrorism and extremism in the country  which dailykills scores of innocent people. My country calls on allgroups and sectors of the Iraqi population to reachconsensus on the basic principles and elementsnecessary to preserve the unity of Iraq and theinviolability of its territory and to ensure that itcontinues to belong to the Arab world. We also call forthe respect of religious  ethnic and sectarian diversityin the framework of free democratic choice  withoutprejudice to the rights of its minorities. We reiterateour support for the political process in Iraq and call onthe international community to lend its support tocreate the appropriate conditions for its success. Wecall also on the United Nations to continue playing itsimportant role.Let me now turn to an issue that is important toJordan: the drying out of the Dead Sea  and how topre-empt an ensuing environmental crisis through theimplementation of the Red Sea-Dead Sea CanalProject. An agreement was reached recently by therelevant parties and beneficiaries of the project  namelyJordan  Israel and the Palestinian National Authority on a feasibility study for the construction of the canal.We look forward to continued international support forthis project and the implementation of all its phases  inaccordance with the agreement mentioned earlier.The future of the Middle East requires thecreation of strong civil societies enjoying decent livesand deriving their guidance from their strong belief intheir heritage. We are endeavouring to achieve thisgoal at the national level through effective reformprojects  whose benefits are beginning to be evident inJordan.But stability  security and peace are essential tocreating a suitable environment for such societies.Putting an end to the Israeli occupation of Arabterritories and reaching a just and comprehensivesolution will contribute to bringing about a brightfuture."
"84",3634,"JPN",60,2005,"I should like  first andforemost  to convey  once again  my sincere sympathyin connection with the victims of the devastationcaused by Hurricane Katrina.Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits sixtieth session. I would also like to pay high tributeto Mr. Jean Ping  your predecessor  for hisdistinguished leadership.The 60-year history of the United Nations hasbeen a pathway towards a peaceful  prosperous and justworld. The path followed by Japan during that time hasbeen  indeed  that of a nation striving for an honouredplace among peace-loving nations. Building upon thedetermination that it will never again follow the path towar  Japan has pursued  and will continue to pursue international peace and stability in partnership with theUnited Nations.Japan needs an effective and efficient UnitedNations and strongly endorses the outcome documentof the summit. To that end  our leadersí commitments as expressed in the document  must be translated intoaction with the utmost urgency. Japan will spare noeffort in that endeavour.The new United Nations must be equipped with abetter peacebuilding capacity. We expect the proposedPeacebuilding Commission to help to achieve thatobjective. To that end  Japan will continue to play aconstructive role  making full use of its experience andresources.In the Gaza Strip  the reconstruction effort afterthe Israeli withdrawal has been crucial. Japan hasimplemented more than $110 million worth ofassistance since the beginning of this year  in thefervent hope that we will now see the resumption ofthe road map.As the largest donor to the Trust Fund for Iraqireconstruction  Japan has devoted its energies tobringing together the international community in thereconstruction effort. Humanitarian and reconstructionassistance by Japan's Self-Defence Forces and officialdevelopment assistance (ODA) are contributing intandem to progress towards a peaceful and prosperousIraq. Japan has pledged ODA amounting to $5 billion of which $1.5 billion in grant assistance has alreadybeen implemented.Japan has taken the lead in assisting the Afghanefforts for disarmament  demobilization andreintegration (DDR)  in conjunction with the UnitedNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).As a result  about 63 000 ex-combatants are tocomplete the reintegration programme by the end ofnext June. Japanese Self-Defence Forces vessels areengaged in activities in the Indian Ocean in support ofthe countries fighting against terrorism. Japan hasannounced that its contribution will total $1 billion bythe end of March 2006  including assistance in the fieldof security.It is essential to ensure a sense of justice in asociety struggling to recover from its suffering in theaftermath of conflict. In the area of establishing therule of law  Japan  in cooperation with the Governmentof Cambodia  has taken the lead in setting up a tribunalto try members of the Khmer Rouge  with acontribution of over $20 million.41Sixty summers have passed since Hiroshima andNagasaki suffered the indescribable horrors of nucleardevastation. Japan again calls upon all Member Statesto renew their determination to bring about a peacefulworld free of nuclear weapons.To that end  Japan will submit a draft resolutionto the General Assembly presenting a concrete agendato strengthen the disarmament and non-proliferationregime  including a call for the early entry into force ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).In that regard  it is extremely regrettable that the 2005Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)concluded without adopting a consensus document onsubstantive issues  and that the outcome documentfound no consensus on disarmament and non-proliferation.The Democratic People's Republic of Koreaísnuclear programmes pose a serious challenge to theinternational non-proliferation regime  centring on theNPT  and constitute a direct threat to peace andstability in North-East Asia. Japan is committed to apeaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through the six-party talks and strongly hopes that the DemocraticPeopleís Republic of Korea will accept the prompt andverifiable dismantlement of all its nuclear weapons andnuclear programmes at the current round of talks inBeijing. Japan will continue to make every effort toensure that the nuclear issue  along with the missileand abduction issues  is comprehensively resolved inaccordance with the Pyongyang Declaration.Japan believes that the Iranian nuclear issueshould be resolved through negotiations by diplomaticmeans. To that end  Japan strongly urges Iran toimplement  in a spirit of sincerity  all the requirementsset out in the relevant resolutions of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors including the full suspension of uranium conversionactivities  and to return to the negotiating table with thethree European Union States.In recent years  we have witnessed countlesstragedies caused by terrorist acts. Japan  for its part has continued to provide assistance to countries in needof capacity-building in the area of counter-terrorism.To consolidate the international legal framework  Japancalls on Member States to join international counter-terrorism conventions and protocols  including thenewly adopted International Convention for theSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.Development provides a foundation for peace andstability. The new United Nations must serve as aneffective Organization for the promotion ofdevelopment. Having recovered from the devastationof the Second World War with global assistance  Japanis in a better position than any other country todemonstrate the significance of ownership andpartnership  poverty reduction through economicgrowth  and human security in promoting development.The concept of human security ó focusing on theprotection and empowerment of individuals ó offers ameaningful approach in a world striving for freedomand dignity. The concept also provides an importantviewpoint with respect to the protection of humanrights. I look forward to forthcoming discussions onthis concept in the General Assembly  to which leaderscommitted themselves in the outcome document.Based on its experiences as a recipient  and also adonor for more than a half century  Japan has beenkeen to make an impact on world development andthus has contributed one-fifth of world ODA over thepast 10 years. Japan is resolved to continue its supportfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs). To that end  Japan intends to increase itsODA volume by $10 billion over the next five years.For the achievement of the MDGs  addressing theissues facing Africa is critically important. As PrimeMinister Koizumi announced during the Asia-Africasummit  Japan will double its ODA to Africa in thenext three years and host the fourth TokyoInternational Conference on African Development(TICAD) meeting in 2008. In an effort to supportAfricansí own efforts to bring about peace andstability  Japan has devoted its energies to theconsolidation of peace in such countries as the Sudan the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Sierra Leone Burundi and Liberia.With respect to the Sudan  Japan has decided todisburse more than half of its pledged assistance of$100 million  with a contribution of personnel throughthe United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS).Furthermore  to address the humanitarian crisis inAfrica and in other regions caused by infectiousdiseases  Japan has announced $500 million infinancial assistance in the coming years for the GlobalFund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. Japan42will contribute $5 billion over the next five years to theìHealth and Developmentî Initiative. Japan has alsotaken steps to address the ìforgotten crisesî in Africaand will continue to focus on those issues.At no other time in its history has an effective efficient and credible United Nations been moreneeded than today. The credibility of the UnitedNations is at stake. The basic structure of the SecurityCouncil continues to reflect the world of 1945. Reformof the Security Council therefore remains key toachieving the overall renewal of the United Nations.The fact that an overwhelming majority of MemberStates - 166 countries in all - called for SecurityCouncil reform during the previous session of theGeneral Assembly is a testament to the urgent need forreform.For the first time in the 60-year history of theUnited Nations  during the last General Assemblysession we witnessed the submission of draftresolutions calling for fundamental change in thecomposition of the Security Council. Japan is proud tohave taken the lead in promoting Security Councilreform. It is encouraging  as well  that a large numberof leaders at the recent summit expressed their supportfor reform.I believe that Japan's path of striving forinternational peace speaks for itself  and should serveas the basis for a larger role for Japan as a permanentmember of a reformed Security Council. I can assureyou  Mr. President  that Japan will continue to make itsutmost effort to realize the reform under yourleadership. And I call on Member States to reach anearly decision at this session of the General Assembly.The new United Nations requires an efficient andeffective Secretariat  with a strong sense of integrity.Japan is deeply concerned about recent developments including the failure over the oil-for-food programme.The management and administration of the UnitedNations system must be transparent and accountable toMember States and their citizens. In this regard  Japanwill promote and conduct more comprehensiveperformance evaluation of United Nations activities.With respect to the anachronistic ìenemy Stateîclauses  I am pleased to note that the leaders resolvedin the outcome document (resolution 60/1) to deletethese obsolete clauses from the Charter at the earliestopportunity.A comprehensive review is also needed in orderto reach agreement on a scale of assessment structurethat is more equitable and fair. Japan will activelyparticipate in the negotiations to be concluded by theend of next year. In the upcoming negotiation process Japan will make its utmost effort to ensure that thestatus and responsibilities of a Member State are dulytaken into account in the scale of assessments.We have embarked on a mission to renew theUnited Nations. A great deal of work lies ahead. I callupon all representatives in this Hall to dedicatethemselves to accomplishing this unfinished missionby the close of this commemorative session of theGeneral Assembly."
"85",3659,"KAZ",60,2005,"We can safely claim that the United Nations summit that has just been concluded will have far-reaching implications for our Organization. Its outcome has prepared the ground for the most radical reform in the entire history of the United Nations. An effective response by the family of nations to global challenges and threats is the ultimate goal of these reforms. Kazakhstan expresses its confidence that the United Nations  as a universal Organization to which there is no alternative  is in a position to achieve that goal.  As a matter of principle  Kazakhstan supports closer interdependence among the three main pillars of the contemporary world: development  freedom and peace. Yet the issues of development should continue to be the focus of attention of the world community. The Millennium Development Goals can be achieved only through the active engagement of the entire international community on the basis of partnership and cooperation. Kazakhstan is committed to its undertakings with regard to the timely and effective attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. The recently published report on Kazakhstan’s progress in implementing the Millennium Development Goals report in Kazakhstan reveals that as a result of successful reforms my country is close to reaching important targets in this area.   Today Kazakhstan is confidently leading other post-Soviet States in all macroeconomic indicators. The Government of Kazakhstan is implementing a large-scale programme to ensure further development in the social field. Human development is the focus of all these efforts. Kazakhstan is reaching a new level in the area of sustainable development. The national Government is paying priority attention to poverty  women’s issues  employment  financial aid from the State to poor families  the development of small and medium-sized businesses  and large-scale educational  health and environmental programmes.   We commend the United Nations and its specialized agencies for their efforts to assist our country in addressing the effects of environmental disasters in the area of the Aral Sea and in the Semipalatinsk region. The problems facing those regions are global in their scope as the environmental situation there has negative effects on the habitat and livelihood of people all over the world. We urge the international community to be involved actively. In particular we ask it at this session of the General Assembly to support a draft resolution to be sponsored by Kazakhstan on the problems of the Semipalatinsk region.   International trade is an important factor for development. Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a priority for Kazakhstan. We consider further liberalization of trade and WTO membership as key elements of our country’s general development strategy. In 2003 Kazakhstan hosted the International Ministerial Conference on Transit Transport Cooperation. We attach great importance to    16 05-51226  that forum and believe that the special needs of landlocked developing countries should be fully taken into account in accordance with the decisions and recommendations emanating from the Almaty Programme of Action. The integration of Kazakhstan and other Central Asian States into the world economy is of exceptional importance both for the social and economic development of our region and for the world economy in general. Our country is committed to comprehensive cooperation with the other States of Central Asia. That is our consistent policy  unswayed by political exigencies.  Since the early years of its independence  Kazakhstan has been pursuing a principled policy of demilitarization and nuclear disarmament. We call for the universalization of international instruments in that area. This year we marked the tenth anniversary of the removal from the territory of Kazakhstan of all nuclear devices left over from the former Soviet Union. Kazakhstan has set a commendable example by voluntarily eliminating its nuclear arsenal  the fourth largest in the world  and shutting down the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground  the site of nearly 500 nuclear explosions.   The global security system is in serious crisis today. The 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) failed to set up a balanced and comprehensive mechanism that would facilitate the strengthening of the international non-proliferation regime and the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.   Even more disturbing is the lack of clear recommendations on non-proliferation and disarmament in the outcome document of the summit (resolution 60/1). We believe that it is necessary to put in place a mechanism for international sanctions against States that violate both the NPT Treaty and the non-proliferation regime in general. Otherwise we will not be able to prevent the continuous spread of nuclear weapons around the world. Our country calls for the establishment and enhancement of controls over nuclear  chemical and biological materials and their production technologies in order to prevent terrorists from getting hold of deadly weapons.  Kazakhstan recognizes the special role of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). All of our country’s nuclear activities are being carried out in accordance with its standards and under its control. It is time to establish similar effective bodies within the framework of the international Conventions on chemical and biological weapons.   The international community should not relax efforts to combat illegal trafficking in conventional arms. According to the United Nations  some 500 million small arms and light weapons are in circulation all over the world. We share the view of the Secretary-General  who has compared small arms to weapons of mass destruction  because  year after year  they kill hundreds of thousands of people all over the world  thus fostering a culture of violence and terror and trampling on human rights.  Kazakhstan categorically condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and considers it to be the most dangerous threat in today’s world. We are convinced that economic and social underdevelopment  poverty and misery breed international terrorism. That is why speedy economic advancement of poor countries is a priority task.   Yet the ideology of terrorism is a factor of no lesser importance. It is extremely dangerous that young people are increasingly being sucked into the ideological orbit of international terrorism. Fighting terrorism is a mission of paramount importance. For that reason  close attention should be paid to the efforts to prevent recruitment for terrorist operations.   In that context  the international community must urgently take practical steps to curb the ongoing drug trafficking across Central Asia. We cannot but be seriously concerned by the situation in Afghanistan. Kazakhstan appreciates cooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.   Enhanced regional cooperation in the struggle against international terrorism is also important. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization sets a positive example in that regard.   Kazakhstan believes that international cooperation in fighting terrorism should be pursued in strict compliance with the norms of international law. We support further universalization and enhancement of anti-terrorist treaty mechanisms. The signing by Kazakhstan of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism is a practical reaffirmation of that position. We are looking forward to the early completion of a comprehensive convention   05-51226 17  against international terrorism. At the same time  joint practical actions to curb that evil represent a key element of the international community’s counter-terrorism activities.  International peacekeeping operations conducted under the umbrella of the United Nations remain an effective tool to prevent and settle crises and to ensure global and regional stability. The lack of an effective and comprehensive mechanism to address the root causes of destructive conflicts is a serious problem of peacekeeping. Preventive action and post-conflict peacebuilding constitute important elements of a comprehensive response by the United Nations to emerging crisis situations.   For Kazakhstan  the proposed Peacebuilding Commission is a step in the right direction. As its main mission it should strive to avert the recurrence of situations in which the lack of a peacebuilding strategy results in the escalation of internal conflicts and ultimately in States further losing their capacity to perform their sovereign functions in an effective and responsible way.   Our country is actively working on issues related to the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA)  which we treat as an important and useful forum for the exchange of views on security issues in the Asian region. It is encouraging to see that the CICA process is gaining momentum and has already become an important factor in today’s international relations.  Kazakhstan believes that the rule of law should play a leading role in international affairs today. Ignoring this principle is one of the main threats to peace and security. Continuing its consistent efforts to accede to international treaties concluded within the framework of the United Nations and to implement their provisions  Kazakhstan intends to ensure strict compliance with the rule of law at both national and international levels.   We closely link our country’s development to building a democratic society based on respect for the rights and freedoms of every individual. Kazakhstan supports the strengthening of democratic institutions and the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations designed to promote the rights and freedoms of citizens and to ensure compliance with the principles of non-interference and the sovereign equality of States.   Kazakhstan supports efforts to carry out a comprehensive reform of the United Nations encompassing all its principal organs. We strongly believe that priority attention should be paid to the General Assembly as the main deliberative  decision-making and representative body of the Organization. The sensitive issue of reform of the Security Council should be resolved on the basis of broad international agreement. We are convinced that the enlargement of the Security Council in accordance with the principle of equitable geographical representation and taking into account the contribution of States concerned towards the development of the world economy and global security would serve the interests of many States and would facilitate comprehensive reform of the United Nations.  The United Nations needs to improve collaboration with regional organizations that make an important contribution to the collective security system. Kazakhstan has repeatedly proposed the creation of a standing body under the Secretary-General that would coordinate cooperation between regional arrangements. In this context we would welcome the establishment of a standing committee on regional organizations.   We in Kazakhstan are convinced that in the twenty-first century the consolidation of peace and security is increasingly dependent on the development of dialogue and interaction between peoples of differing faces  cultures and civilizations. An interfaith dialogue is an integral part of the effort to promote the culture of peace and dialogue between civilizations and to advance the common values reflected in the Millennium Declaration. In this context  Kazakhstan is grateful to the international community for its support of our country’s actions to promote an interfaith dialogue. The General Assembly has recognized Kazakhstan’s positive role in this area through the adoption of a resolution.  As demonstrated over the past 60 years  the United Nations was  still is  and I am sure will continue to be a link between our countries and peoples. The United Nations will not allow our planet to slide into chaos and unrest. It is within our power to strengthen this link. Kazakhstan expresses confidence that the agreements reflected in the outcome document of the historic summit will serve the cause of bringing nations together in the face of existing challenges and threats  ensuring the security  welfare and dignity of our    18 05-51226  peoples  and strengthening the Organization itself for the sake of its noble goals.

"86",3706,"KEN",60,2005,"It gives me great pleasure toaddress the General Assembly on the occasion of myfirst visit to the United Nations as head of State. First  Icongratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside overthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly.I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his able stewardship ofour Organization and the reform proposals he has putforward for our consideration. Since his appointment the Secretary-General has steered the United Nationswith tact and patience. His skill as a builder ofconsensus has indeed been exemplary. We share hisvision for the United Nations in the twenty-firstcentury as outlined in his epic report entitled ìIn largerfreedomî (A/59/2005). I am confident that MemberStates will seize this historic opportunity and deliveron the promise of a better world for posterity.The shift in the global distribution of power accompanied by the emergence of new threats andchallenges  has dramatically changed the contextwithin which the United Nations operates. The UnitedNations of the future must still  however  remain trueto the universal values that inspired its creation. Ourpeoples expect the United Nations to act as an agent ofprogress. They look to the Organization to play aneffective and leading role in improving their economicand social well-being.Kenya embraces the principles of the Charter which serve as a basic reference point for the reform ofthe United Nations. Those principles are the core of itsinner strength. We believe that the principle ofdemocracy is as central to this Organization and itsfuture health as it is to the prosperity of our ownnations. Kenya deeply cherishes that principle andseeks its generous spread around the world and in thisinstitution.Global problems require global solutions. TheUnited Nations is the only vehicle that can help usattain those solutions and give legitimacy to ouractions. The United Nations remains indispensable inthe maintenance of international peace and security. Itis pivotal to the attainment of sustainable developmentand the advancement of human rights. Let us work tostrengthen the United Nations to meet contemporarychallenges.Important proposals for United Nations reformare already on the table. My Government embraces theholistic definition of collective security  which stronglyaffirms the connections between peace  development human rights and the rule of law. Those goals cannotbe realized in isolation. As the Secretary-Generalobserved  ìwe will not enjoy development withoutsecurity  we will not enjoy security withoutdevelopment  and we will not enjoy either withoutrespect for human rightsî (A/59/2005  para. 17). I amsure we all acknowledge those plain truths.15Kenya firmly believes that reform of the UnitedNations is a process  not an event. In view of theintegrated nature of the issues  we need to adopt acomprehensive policy approach to United Nationsreforms. We must maintain a broad vision driven bycollective effort for the ultimate benefit of theinternational system.I am happy to note that although some of theproposals have been adopted  we should now movequickly to implement them. I refer especially to theproposals that do not require amendment of theCharter. They include the adoption of a robust counter-terrorism strategy  strengthening peacekeeping creating a Peacebuilding Commission and Fund and thereform of the human rights system.I am also pleased to note the consensus on thestrengthening of the General Assembly  the Economicand Social Council and a strong relationship betweenthe United Nations and regional and subregionalorganizations.Environmental protection is a threat that is amajor challenge in the attainment of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. This places the environment  morethan ever  at the core of sustainable development.International environmental governance is an integralpart of realizing sustainable development. Kenya fullyendorses the ongoing process of defining the elementsof international environmental governance. This however  should be done within the framework of theCartagena decision  which aims at strengthening theUnited Nations Environment Programme within itscurrent mandate through an enhanced financial andscientific base.We should also recognize that no truly effectiveresponse can be made unless the internationalcommunity fully complies with its commitment tomake the means available as provided for in variousmultilateral environmental agreements.Kenya remains firmly committed to the UnitedNations Programme of Action on Small Arms andLight Weapons and is gratified with the status of itsimplementation  at both national and regional levels.Despite the progress made  small arms and otherconventional weapons continue to end up in the handsof wrong non-State actors  with attendant adverseimplications on peace and security leading to politicalinstability in many countries. In order to curb thistrend  Kenya requests the Secretary-General toundertake a study into the possibility of a legalinstrument to control international transfers ofconventional arms.Kenya also supports proposals for theenhancement of peace-support operation capabilities ofthe United Nations. Any mandate for peacekeepingforces should be clear and precise. Adequate resourcesmust be made available to the commanders in the fieldto enable them to execute their mandates effectively.Intervention in crisis situations must also be timely toprevent undue loss of life. Kenya welcomes vitalcontributions to peace and security made by regionalorganizations forging predictable partnerships betweenthe United Nations and regional organizations.Furthermore  Kenya endorses the proposal toestablish a strategic military capacity to reinforceUnited Nations peacekeeping and the creation of astandby brigade for rapid deployment of theOrganizationís civilian police in peacekeepingoperations.We strongly support the Secretary-Generalísproposal to establish a Peacebuilding Commission andfund by 31 December 2005. We believe such apeacebuilding commission will contribute to therealization of real peace in many regions. However  itis important that critical questions about form  functionand decision-making authority be resolved.In our own neighbourhood  the importance ofpost-conflict peacebuilding has become a biggerpriority after the recent successes of the Sudan andSomalia mediation efforts  which Kenya chaired underthe auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority onDevelopment.Kenya commends the international communityfor the excellent response during the Oslo pledgingconference towards reconstruction of southern Sudan.We urge a similar response to support the TransitionalFederal Government of Somalia in setting up andimplementing a national security  stabilization andeconomic reconstruction strategy.We also call upon the Security Council to play amore positive proactive role in the search for a broadconsensus for peace and thus enhance the capacity ofthe Transitional Federal Government to establish basicinstitutions.On the reform of the Security Council  it isnecessary to make it far more equitable and16representative of the United Nations globalconstituency. The procedures and methods of work ofthe Council should be changed to secure transparencyand dialogue with the United Nations membership.Furthermore  the future composition of theSecurity Council should proceed on the basis ofsovereign equality of States and equitable geographicalrepresentation.Kenya welcomes the proposal to develop astronger relationship between the United Nations andregional and subregional organizations. For Africa there is abundant political will in our continent to makethe African Union succeed. I believe that externalsupport  especially from the United Nations and theinternational community at large  would make theAfrican Union work better.The establishment of an African Union Peace andSecurity Council and of the intervention force plannedto be set up by 2009 are measures aimed at advancingpolitical stability in Africa to underpin economicdevelopment. Already  the African Union has taken thelead in Burundi and in Darfur  in the Sudan  wheredeployments of peacekeeping missions have precededinternational action by the United Nations.The recent pledges by the Group of Eight (G-8)countries to double aid to Africa and grant 100-per-cent debt relief to 18 developing countries werewelcome. We hope they will honour their pledges andcommitments in conformity with the agreement forgedat the 2002 Monterrey International Conference onFinancing for Development. Support by the G-8 willhelp African countries achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.Kenya affirms the centrality of gender equalityand recognizes the critical role that women must playin development. We also recognize that achievement ofthe Millennium Development Goals depends on theempowerment of women. As part of our effort to fullyattain this objective  my Government has adopted anational policy on gender development. The aim is tointegrate women in decision-making through legal regulatory and institutional reforms.I am convinced that  if we are to attain ourcommon objective of revitalizing the United Nations we should embrace the vision presented by theSecretary-General in his package of reforms. This willrequire political will and leadership on our part. Itherefore urge Member States to seize this opportunityand endorse proposals on which there is broadconsensus. As we contemplate strengthening andrenewing our Organization  we should do so forposterity."
"87",3730,"KGZ",60,2005,"At theoutset  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to the important post of President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth anniversary sessionand to wish you every success in your responsible anddifficult task. May I also extend our thanks to yourpredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  for his successfulpresidency of the previous session of the Assembly.The summit that ended yesterday demonstratedthat the United Nations remains the universalOrganization capable of making an importantcontribution to strengthening international peace andsecurity  achieving sustainable development andfinding adequate answers to new global challenges andthreats. In that regard  I hope that this sixtiethanniversary session of the General Assembly willbecome a major event in and give people some hopefor the future.The rapid changes in today’s world have notbypassed Kyrgyzstan. Our people  not indifferent to itsown destiny and future  in March of this year chose itsown path to development  progress and creativity.Another page has been turned in Kyrgyzstan’s modernhistory. We enter the twenty-first century full ofresolve to achieve our deepest aspirations and hopesfor peace  prosperity  progress and freedom. We areconfident that that the goals reflected in theMillennium Declaration will be achieved in the KyrgyzRepublic as elsewhere.If it is to preserve the respect and to justify thehopes of peoples  the United Nations must not lagbehind the swift and ever accelerating changes takingplace in the world today. It must not only adapt tocurrent realities  but also create more effectivemachinery for addressing new challenges and risks.Kyrgyzstan is convinced that United Nationsreform should fully reflect the will  fundamental rightsand interests of all States Members and peoples.In recent years  the Security Council has beenrepeatedly criticized for its failures in the maintenanceof international peace and security. It is thereforeextremely important that the Security Council find themost effective way to meet its basic responsibility forthe maintenance of international peace and security.Kyrgyzstan has consistently advocated expansion ofthe membership of the Security Council and reform ofits working methods in order to make it morerepresentative  democratic and  above all  moreeffective. We believe that the reform of the SecurityCouncil should be based on the principles ofuniversality  efficiency and broad geographicrepresentation. The Council’s decisions must be astimely as possible and their implementationcorrespondingly expeditious and effective.The Kyrgyz Republic shares the position thatUnited Nations reform will be successful only ifSecurity Council reform is followed by reform of theGeneral Assembly and the Economic and SocialCouncil. We support efforts to enhance the activities ofthe General Assembly and to strengthen thecoordinating functions of the Economic and SocialCouncil. Effective coordination among the threeprincipal organs is extremely important in addressingthe complex problems facing the world today.We all realize how great and complex are thechallenges facing the United Nations in themaintenance of peace and security. Kyrgyzstan intendsto make its contribution to those tasks. For the firsttime  it has offered its own candidature for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for theterm 2012-2013. We understand the great responsibilitythat membership of that crucial organ of the UnitedNations entails. I would venture to assure the19Assembly that Kyrgyzstan will make every effort toincrease its cooperation with Member States in allregions and to become a reliable partner in resolvingglobal political issues.Today  the United Nations and its agencies aremore engaged with issues of development than withthose of security. While many United Nations agenciesdeal every day with the problems of development there is only one permanent organ that deals withsecurity issues. In our opinion  given globalization andthe interrelationship of all issues relating to man-madeand natural disasters  along with international terrorismand extremism  the United Nations capacity tomaintain global security must be considerablystrengthened. We believe that developmentprogrammes should be endowed with preventivepowers to ensure security and safety.The history of international relations in thesecond half of the last century shows that it is virtuallyimpossible to preserve international peace and securitywhen certain basic conditions of life remain unmet.Poverty and deprivation lead to tension  which in turnsleads to breaches of international peace and security. Itis no accident that it is precisely the poorest regions ofthe world that suffer the most serious regionalconflicts. If it is to achieve its security anddevelopment targets  the international community mustadopt a more balanced policy.The world community must work actively toovercome disparities and inequalities between thecountries of the North and the South. We feel that theUnited Nations needs to establish interactivemachinery to resolve the issues that cause the poorestcountries to opt out of the process of globaldevelopment and decision-making. The countries of theSouth should become full partners in decisionsinvolving global problems.Kyrgyzstan remains committed to the MontereyConsensus  whereby the developed countries willincrease their development assistance and poorcountries will adapt themselves to using that assistancemore effectively. At various high-level forums  wehave come to understood the concepts of sustainableeconomic development and sustainable humandevelopment. We fully support those concepts  withsubstantive provisions reflected in our national strategyand programmes.Furthermore  the successful implementation ofthe national development programmes of manycountries is directly linked to regional and internationalcooperation. It is at the juncture where all of thoseinterests meet that the United Nations and its agenciesmust further enhance their role and coordinate theirefforts.We support the proposal for national developmentstrategies to be adopted by 2006 and implemented by2015 as indicators for the implementation of thedevelopment goals set out in the MillenniumDeclaration. In our opinion  the United Nations shouldmobilize new resources  strengthen coordination andincrease its contribution to the resolution ofdevelopment issues.Donor countries must now move from paying lip-service to their obligations to concrete action. In thatregard  the Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the decision ofthe European Union to allocate 0.7 per cent of its grossnational income to official development assistance by2009. Kyrgyzstan also advocates the identification ofan acceptable level of indebtedness and the adoption ofurgent and commensurate measures to ease the debtburden of developing countries.Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked  mountainous country.Mountain States are characterized by remoteness difficult accessibility  the scarcity of information  harshgeo-climatic conditions  and high costs of living. Whilereceiving financial aid from the developed countries Kyrgyzstan itself is a donor of environmental serviceswhose value increases yearly. So  for example  theKyrgyz Republic is one of the principal repositories ofglaciers and suppliers of fresh water in the region.Moreover  in the context of the InternationalConvention on Biological Diversity  Kyrgyzstan alsooperates a network of biosphere areas and releasesmuch less greenhouse gases into the atmosphere thanmost other countries of the world  thus contributing tothe preservation of the planet’s ozone layer.At the same time  unfortunately  in our territory our many stockpiles of radioactive waste are aninheritance from the military-industrial complex of theformer Soviet period. Their maintenance and theprevention of further potential ecological accidents forthe entire Central-Asian region are an excessive burdenfor Kyrgyzstan. We believe that the internationalcommunity  with a coordinating role for the UnitedNations  should more actively involve itself in those20areas of environmental risk and provide more financialand technical assistance to avert global and regionalecological disasters.We also believe that the United Nations should bemore active in assisting poor and developing countriesregarding sustainable development by creatingmachinery to shift the burden of external debt tosustainable development. A significant amount of ourincome goes to servicing our debt  hindering the socio-economic development of mountainous areas.In addition to disaster preparedness andmitigation  Kyrgyzstan supports initiatives on thecreation of a worldwide early warning system fornatural disasters. As a mountain country  Kyrgyzstanregularly faces serious and frequent natural disasters such as earthquakes  landslides  avalanches  and theflooding of cities and settlements. In our harshexperience  the consequences of such natural disastersdivert huge sums from economic and socialdevelopment and highlight the importance ofstrengthening ecological security. As a first step Kyrgyzstan offers the use of its territory as a pilot areafor the prevention and mitigation of such naturaldisasters.I would also like to express our support for theestablishment of a committee of regional organizationsunder United Nations auspices. Such a committeewould enable the exploitation of untapped potential ofthe regional and subregional organizations in theprevention and settlement of conflicts and otherimportant regional problems. Regional structures withsuch potential that are now operating effectively shouldplay a mutually complementary role in facing newthreats and challenges. Kyrgyzstan supports theparticipation in the work of the committee of suchorganizations as the Shanghai CooperationOrganization  the Collective Security TreatyOrganization  the Euro-Asian Economic Union and theCentral Asian Cooperation Organization.We also support measures to enhance theeffectiveness of peacekeeping operations and welcomethe Secretary-General’s proposal on United Nationsstandby forces of peacekeepers and civilian police.The Kyrgyz Republic is the only country inCentral Asia that participates in United Nationspeacekeeping operations. We have sent militaryobservers and staff officers to the United Nationsmissions in Liberia  Burundi  Sierra Leone  Serbia andMontenegro  and the Sudan. We are proud of ourcontribution and are resolved to continue supportingthat noble endeavour.Kyrgyzstan actively supports the efforts of theinternational community to restore and strengthenpeace in Afghanistan and has opened its territory to theforces of the counter-terrorism coalition and theCollective Security Treaty Organization to provideregional security measures.We remain committed to the establishment of anuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. The text ofthe agreement on such a zone has been agreed by fivecountries of our region and we are pleased that theKyrgyz Republic is to be the depositary of the treaty.We feel that this is evidence of the great respect andtrust in which our Republic is held with regard to theinitiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone. I amfirmly convinced that the establishment of such a zonein our region will strengthen global security andregional stability. We hope to obtain the correspondingsupport of the world community.In conclusion  I would like to note that the worldcommunity is going through a difficult phase in theestablishment of a new system of internationalrelations. Clearly  it will be a long  drawn-out process.The States Members of the United Nations shouldaffirm their readiness to find practical solutions to themost essential problems of our time: combatingpoverty  famine and disease and to work for sustainabledevelopment. This session of the General Assemblywill be remembered as the session of reforms."
"88",3773,"KHM",60,2005,"I wish to join otherrepresentatives in congratulating you  Sir  on yourunanimous election as the President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixtieth session. I am confident that under your able guidance  the General Assembly willrespond wisely and effectively to the needs andexpectations of the international community. I wouldlike to assure you of Cambodia's full support andcooperation as you carry out the duties and tasks ofyour high office.While commending the efforts and contributionsof Mr. Jean Ping  President of the General Assembly atits fifty-ninth session  I wish also to express myappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for hispolitical vision and his firm commitment to the effortsto strengthen and revitalize the role of the UnitedNations in securing international peace  strengtheninginternational security and forging internationalcooperation.In these times of uncertainties and difficulties when the world seems to be inundated by conflicts andtribulations  the summit of the General Assembly andthe outcome document reaffirmed our commitment tothe principles of the Charter of the United Nations andprovided us with a new hope for achieving our noblegoals of strengthening peace and stability in the world a sine qua non for the development and prosperity ofall humankind. Admittedly  the outcome document didnot respond to all of our concerns  but it gave us aframework for our future action. It is important for usto keep hope alive and to maintain our commitment toglobal peace and to taking the necessary steps to ensurethat that noble goal will one day be achieved.As a country that has just emerged from manyyears of war and internal conflicts  Cambodiaunderstands the paramount importance of peace.Cambodia is firmly convinced that more weapons willnot bring more security to the world. Disarmament like any other matter on our agenda today  cannot bedealt with in isolation. There is an urgent need for thatmatter to be dealt with at the national  regional andinternational levels. We are of the view that thepromotion of confidence-building measures isnecessary in that endeavour. The experiences gained bythe Regional Forum of the Association of South-EastAsian Nations ó now in its eleventh year of existenceó have confirmed the rightness of that approach.This explains the rationale behind Cambodia'sratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of theDevelopment  Production  Stockpiling and Use ofChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction on19 July 2005. Cambodia is a proponent of thereinforcement of international law  which  inter alia incorporates the major instruments to curb the armsrace  including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) and the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We note with dismay anddeep concern that the recent NPT Review Conferenceended without achieving any results  and we regret thefailure to reach consensus on that very crucial issue inthe outcome document of the High-level PlenaryMeeting. Cambodia profoundly believes in thenecessity and benefit of disarmament. We believe thatpeople need food  not weapons.After 11 September 2001  security perceptionshave changed drastically. Nobody and no country issafe from terrorism  which has caused untold sufferingand death among innocent people and knows nodistinction between the rich and the poor  the powerfuland the powerless  between a super-Power and a littlespeck in the ocean  as we have seen in many parts ofthe world. When death strikes  we are all the same. Thesecurity of our people cannot be assured and ensuredthrough weaponry and sophisticated technology alone.Another threat created by the force of nature Hurricane Katrina  which devastated the States ofLouisiana  Mississippi  Alabama and even Florida reinforced us in that conviction. The human brain is adecisive factor of and the essence behind our efforts tocounter security threats and threats of any other nature.Therefore  it is more important than ever that ourstrategies be preventive  comprehensive  inclusive andglobal in nature. I would like to take this opportunity toexpress  on behalf of the people and the RoyalGovernment of Cambodia  my profound condolences tothe families of the victims who have lost their lives  aswell as deepest sympathy for the survivors of thattragic incident.During the summit  our leaders endorsed theSecretary-General's identification of elements of acounter-terrorism strategy. Such a strategy wouldcontribute to our concerted efforts to fight terrorism inall its forms and manifestations  which would beundertaken in full respect of human rights andfundamental freedom. I hope that our joint efforts will18lead to an agreement on the comprehensive conventionon international terrorism.As part of the Government's policy of playing anactive role in international efforts to combat terrorism in particular by fulfilling its obligations spelled out bythe Counter-Terrorism Committee of the UnitedNations  Cambodia has implemented some necessarymeasures recently. Among other things  we are in theprocess of finalizing our national anti-terrorism law.As we have learned through our experience overthe years  the causes of terrorism do not arisespontaneously. Only through continuous and consistentefforts to promote tolerance  social development economic growth and democracy  and to build a globalcoalition involving all civilizations  all religions  allcultures and all political systems can we fight injustice poverty and the other roots of those malicious andoften lethal acts. Those long-term measures are ofsignificance in our mission effectively to prevent actsof violence and extreme aggression.Sixty years ago  the United Nations wasestablished to spare future generations from thescourge of war. However  the foundation of peace liesin the success of our respective Governments  theirpeoples and the world community at large in forgingtheir future and the future of their children throughbetter health care  education and economic andprofessional opportunities in a safe and secure socialenvironment that abides by the rule of law and theculture of merit and honesty.It goes without saying that development is thecement for peace. Development in one part of theworld cannot be sustained without developmentelsewhere. Cambodia believes in national ownership indevising strategies to develop itself. We also believe inthe crucial importance and necessity of internationalpartnership. We equally believe in the importance ofgood governance at the national  international andcorporate levels. How could we explain our mutualdependency otherwise? Transparency and mutualaccountability are the best guarantees of a successfulpartnership.Cambodia has expressed its full commitment tothe Millennium Declaration. In 2003  Cambodialocalized the global Millennium Development Goals which it calls the Cambodia Millennium DevelopmentGoals (CMDGs). The CMDGs  which reflect therealities of Cambodia  are based on a strong nationalconsensus. Specific indicators have been adopted foreach CMDG  including the benchmarks and the short- medium- and long-term values to be achieved by 2005 2010 and 2015. In all  the CMDGs cover nine areas oflong-term and short-term goals  25 overall targets  and106 specific targets covering extreme poverty andhunger; universal  nine-year basic education; genderequality and women's empowerment; child mortality;maternal health; HIV/AIDS  malaria and otherdiseases; environmental sustainability; globalpartnership for development; and demining unexploded ordinance and victim assistance.At present  Cambodia is in the process ofpreparing a national strategic development plan for2006-2010 by combining its earlier socio-economicdevelopment plan and its national poverty reductionstrategy processes and integrating them into theCMDGs. The resulting CMDG-based national povertyreduction strategy will be rooted in the ìrectangularstrategyî for growth  employment  equity andefficiency  which provides the political platform of theRoyal Government in the third legislature (2004-2008)of Cambodia's National Assembly.Our progress towards achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals is constrained by a number ofimpediments  including the chronic shortage ofinvestment funds to meet our priority requirements.That resource gap needs to be bridged throughincreased flows of external finance. That is necessarysince the current concessions given by the internationalcommunity to least developed countries like Cambodiaprovide only limited benefit to us and need to besupplemented by increased inflows of developmentfinance. If we are to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  greater financial inflows throughaid  reduced debt servicing and increased currentaccount inflows are critical to bridging the resourcegaps and fostering the required growth.It is in that connection that we would like toreiterate our call for the implementation of the BrusselsProgramme of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries. We welcome the establishment of timetablesby many developed countries to achieve the target of0.7 per cent of gross national income for officialdevelopment assistance by no later than 2015 and toreach at least 0.5 per cent by 2009. We urge thosedeveloped countries that have not yet done so to makeconcrete efforts and invite them to establish timetablesfor achieving the target of 0.7 per cent. We also urge19those developed countries to achieve the target of 0.15to 0.20 per cent of gross national income for officialdevelopment assistance to the least developedcountries.The Royal Government of Cambodia welcomesthe resumption of the six-party talks on the Koreanpeninsula. Equally crucial is the continuation of theinter-Korean dialogue. It is our belief that openchannels of communication are essential in building astrong foundation for attempts to pursue peace andstability in the Korean peninsula.We also welcome the recent positivedevelopments in the Middle East and continue toencourage the implementation of the road map and therelevant Security Council resolutions. After all theyears of war and conflict  we reiterate our call on bothsides to continue taking steps towards peace  no matterhow small they might seem at the time  in order to givethe children of Palestine and Israel the opportunity tolive in harmony.The dire situation in Africa deserves our outmostconcern and action. Too many African children andadults have suffered too long from too many conflicts.At the end of the day  the world community  throughthe United Nations and the Group of Eight leadingindustrial countries should strive to make moreefficient efforts and to take timely action to tackle thesevere plights of numerous innocent people in sub-Saharan Africa.It is important for us never to lose hope  because as history has shown us  hope is what carries usthrough difficult times and dreadful challenges.Because of hope  we lend a hand to others. Because ofhope  we let ourselves be assisted by others. Althoughwe are indeed facing an uphill battle in our attempts toovercome the challenges of peace  security anddevelopment together  our noble goals to provide abetter future for our children and grandchildren will beachieved. Let us have faith in our common house  theUnited Nations."
"89",3787,"KIR",60,2005,"Please accept mycongratulations  Sir  on your election to the presidency and my assurances that Kiribati will support you duringyour term of office. I would also like to take thisopportunity to thank the outgoing President  Mr. JeanPing  for his able and effective leadership during thefifty-ninth session.During last week's High-level Plenary Meeting we discussed  among other issues  the future of thisOrganization and what we expect from it. We heard aboutthe achievements made by our Organization over the past60 years. We express our gratitude to all nations for thecooperation and support that led to those achievements.I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General aswell as his staff  for his leadership of our Organizationat these difficult and trying times.We also heard about the shortcomings of ourOrganization. While we recognize and fully endorsethe need for reform in the Organization  we areconcerned that many of the shortcomings in terms ofthe promotion of sustainable development in Membernations  in particular in the small island developingStates  are the result of our inability to deliver oncommitments made in the past.Individual Member nations have the primeresponsibility for achieving sustainable developmentwithin their borders  but with globalization and theincreasing interdependency of our world  individualnations cannot achieve sustainable development actingalone. To attain sustainable development in smallisland developing States  the need for externalcooperation and support is understandably morepronounced.Having taken stock of progress over the past 60years  the challenge now is to consider measures bywhich we can collectively and through the UnitedNations address the needs and concerns highlightedduring the High-level Plenary Meeting. Of particularconcern are the special needs of the least developedcountries and small island developing States.While Kiribati may be categorized as a leastdeveloped country and a small island developing State the people of Kiribati have a genuine desire to developthemselves and at the same time to develop theircountry. As their elected representatives  we have aclear mandate and duty to make our best efforts to meettheir development aspirations.2Population issues are a major challenge in ourdevelopment efforts. Concerted efforts to promoteeffective family planning have been given greaterfocus in our national development strategies. Thegrowing number of unemployed youth brings with itnew social issues. We are committed to directing theenergy of our youth to productive and worthwhilepursuits. Employment opportunities abroad for bothmen and women  such as the arrangements in placewith foreign shipping companies  fishing companiesand cruise operators  will be expanded and newopportunities explored. The New Zealand Government'sPacific Access Category scheme is a very welcomemodel that merits closer scrutiny by other countries.The spiralling cost of fuel is an issue of graveconcern to us. The impact of rising fuel costs has beenhardest on the least developed countries  which are alsothe least able to afford it. Therefore  the need toaccelerate the development of alternative sources ofenergy  including clean and renewable energy  is nowgreater than it ever was.We firmly believe that our fishery resources canprovide us with the basis for achieving a sustainablefuture  but in order to be able to do so  we shall needthe assistance of our development partners in providingthe necessary incentives through the provision of creditschemes to those investors who are able and willing todevelop onshore facilities within resource-owningcountries.But before we can achieve that  and if we are toachieve our Millennium Development Goals  we shallcontinue to be reliant on the official developmentassistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross nationalincome being met.Environmental issues and  in particular  climatechange and sea-level rise are security issues forcountries comprising low-lying coral atolls  such asKiribati. A global and concerted effort  includingstronger political commitment  is required to achievethe objectives of the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change.We are appreciative of the support we havereceived and continue to receive in developingadaptation measures to climate change and sea-levelrise. We nevertheless acknowledge the need now toseriously consider the option of having to relocate ourpeoples when necessary — an option that can bemeaningfully addressed only within this forum.Kiribati fully endorses the need forcomprehensive reform in the United Nations. Theenvironment in which the Organization now operates isso very different from that of 1945. Reform must takeplace to ensure that the Organization continues to be arelevant institution for its Member countries.Terrorism threatens all. Kiribati condemnsterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and wesupport the global fight against terrorism. We havenoted with increasing alarm the globalization of terror.We cannot afford to be complacent about terrorism andwill contribute  within our resource constraints  to thewar against terror. We seek support from those able andwilling in the implementation and enforcement ofcounter-terrorism legislation we have passed incompliance with our obligations as a member of theglobal community.Kiribati has contributed to the RegionalAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. We willcontinue to contribute to that regional effort as long asthere is need. Kiribati is also interested in contributingcivilian police to peacekeeping missions of the UnitedNations.Kiribati supports an expansion of the permanentand non-permanent membership of the Security Council.In our view  those countries  such as Japan  that aresignificant contributors to United Nations programmespromoting peace  security and development merit apermanent seat on the Security Council.As we consider reform of the United Nations andas we celebrate 60 years of the United Nations  webelieve that now is also the time to consider the issueof Taiwan and its 23 million people. Taiwan is acountry where democracy thrives  where the rule oflaw prevails and where human rights are respected.Taiwan has also remained able and willing to makesignificant contributions to the collaborative efforts tosecure global peace  security and prosperity.We also believe that  whatever the views are onthe question of whether Taiwan is a domestic issue ornot  there can be no justification for supportingthreatening initiatives  such as the so called anti-secession law  which could have such far-reachingeffects on regional and global stability.I am confident that  under your leadership  Sir we will work with unity of purpose and perhaps withless posturing to address the challenges before us."
"90",3818,"KNA",60,2005,"MyGovernment supports the report of the Secretary-General  which reaffirms development  peace  securityand human rights as fundamental to the well-being ofany modern State. The Government of Saint Kitts andNevis steadfastly contends that there is an inherent linkbetween poverty reduction  the promotion of humanrights  economic development  security and goodgovernance.Regrettably  the tendency has been to separatethem  in favour of what some call political imperatives.I daresay policies do not and cannot exist in a vacuum.Politics is about people  and therefore national regional or even international organizational policiesmust be about people. There is stark evidence of this.The political landscape reveals clear indicationsof the interconnectedness of the phenomena of povertyeradication  security  economic development andgovernance. The task of governance is becomingincreasingly difficult in the face of growingunemployment  deepening poverty  escalating energyprices and a mounting cost of living. As aconsequence  we have witnessed social dislocationsand civil disquiet. The fruits of globalization still donot grow among the worldís poorest  who have becomefurther marginalized and blame their Governments which  despite their best efforts  are often relegated tothe margins of political discourse and economicactivities.Some citizens have become more vocal and moreopen in their distrust of Government policies that failto deliver the promises of democracy andglobalization  fail to reduce poverty and unemploymentand fail to improve their standard of living. Theeconomic and political rift between rich and poornations is steadily becoming a deeper divide asmistrust continues to characterize relations between thedeveloped and the developing countries.Understandably  small countries ó despitelimited and diminishing resources ó are expected toparticipate equally in the fight against the socialscourges that confront us. But that dramaticallyreduces our ability to make new and necessaryinvestments in socio-economic development. It iswithin that context that we urge Member nations tosubstantively support the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. We also urge them to partner with us recognizing our vulnerabilities to natural disasters andother external economic factors  and recognizing theneed for preferred and differential treatment in tradeand access to markets in developed countries. We urgedeveloped countries to implement policies that do not2undermine our efforts or reverse the gains that we insmall developing countries have made. We call forequity and for a willingness to live and let live.Despite overwhelming odds  however  theGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis stands ready todo its share. At the base of our efforts and policies isthe fundamental importance of strengthening the rightsof the child. We believe that promoting the rights of thechild goes to the heart of full and effective protectionof human rights. We also firmly believe that by makingsure every child in Saint Kitts and Nevis has access toprimary and secondary education  to potable water andto health care  we are creating healthier  better adjustedand productive adults whose rights will have beennourished and enshrined in the policy orientation anddevelopment agenda of our proud country.It is generally accepted that the right todevelopment is also a fundamental right that nationalGovernments have a primary responsibility to ensure.Long before the Millennium Development Goals wereformally elaborated and adopted by the community ofnations  that fundamental right was emphaticallyunderstood by the Government and the people of SaintKitts and Nevis. As a point of reference  in this year'sHuman Development Report issued by the UnitedNations Development Programme  Saint Kitts andNevis was ranked 49 out of 177 countries on theHuman Development Index ó the second-highestranking in the Caribbean region and  indeed  among thehighest in the Latin American and Caribbean region.The report reflects the reality in Saint Kitts and Nevis where there is an adult literacy rate of 97.8 per cent  alife expectancy rate of 70 years - which needs upwardrevision - and a combined primary  secondary andtertiary school enrolment ratio of 89 per cent. Thereport underscores our commitment to gender equality starting with current parity in enrolment levels amonggirls and boys in school at both the primary and thesecondary levels. The report also confirms 98 per centaccess to safe water and sanitation. In the field ofhealth  it notes a 99 per cent rate of immunization ofinfants against tuberculosis and measles in Saint Kittsand Nevis.The Pan-Caribbean Partnership to combatHIV/AIDS (PANCAP)  established by the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM)  has proved to be a usefuland pragmatic vehicle for collective action and results.In Saint Kitts and Nevis  our own fight againstHIV/AIDS uses that particular model. PANCAP hasdistinguished itself and has been identified as a best-practice model. We are therefore now pursuing policiesaimed at universal access to treatment and care and atending discrimination and the stigmatization of thosepersons affected by HIV/AIDS  while at the same timecontinuing our public education initiatives onpreventing the spread of the virus.A per capita income of more than $7 000 placesus squarely among upper-middle-income countries. Wethank the United Nations for recognizing our efforts which are the result of policies engineered to ensurethe development of the individual despite the obstaclesthat we face as a small economy. They also reflect thecommitment of my Government to ensuring theprotection of the rights of our children and their role inour countryís future.That  however  is only one side of the coin. Theachievements to which I referred come at an enormouscost - a cost that represents an enormous burden - toour people. The past decade has been particularlydifficult for Saint Kitts and Nevis. Our small islandState continues to be especially vulnerable to naturaldisasters  external economic fluctuations and policiesbiased against small economies such as ours. Mycountry has experienced back-to-back hurricanes landslides and floods  at a cost of more than half abillion dollars. We have been forced to direct more andmore of our scarce resources towards recovery andaway from development.The experience throughout the Caribbean regionis very similar. It was just in July this year that oursister CARICOM nation of Grenada again sufferedserious devastation  caused by Hurricane Emily  on theback of last year's devastation brought by HurricaneIvan. The Maldives  another small island sister nation has made pleas for a delay in the process set in motionfor its graduation from the list of least developedcountries  owing to the tsunami. We specificallysupport the Maldives' request.In addition to the cost of recovery  escalatinghigh prices and the cost of food imports  Saint Kittsand Nevis  as an emerging tourist destination  hasfaced the prohibitively high cost of implementingsupplementary security measures since 11 September2001. To further compound that grave situation  therecent rulings of the World Trade Organization relativeto trade preferences have dealt a most significant blow3to small economies in the Caribbean and thereforethreaten to unravel their economic base.In the case of my country  after centuries of sugarproduction and sales to the European market - whichhave been a cornerstone of our economic support andour social stability - we have been forced to close thatindustry  which finally succumbed to continuous lossesand escalating debts. Saint Kitts and Nevis can nolonger compete profitably in a world market that ischaracterized by engineered low prices for sugar andby the unfair trading practices of some countries. Thathas severe implications in terms of unemployment social dislocation  psychological distress and thedramatic loss of urgently needed foreign-exchangeearnings.We have tried to prepare for such an eventualitythrough a process of economic diversification  butsupport from the international community has not beenforthcoming. The cost of borrowing  the removal ofgrant financing from the menus of internationalfinancial institutions and the annual recovery costsfrom catastrophic hurricanes have become more andmore onerous. Creative legal policy initiatives especially in the international financial services sector have been challenged and undermined by somedeveloped countries.In an attempt to fulfil the MillenniumDevelopment Goals by 2015  my Government has alsopursued policies to stimulate and facilitate private-sector-led growth by investing in physicalinfrastructure and human resource development. Butwe need international political and economic support.The Secretary-General underscored that threats topeace and security represent different things todifferent countries. If we intend to promote collectivesecurity  there must be an appreciation of andsensitivity to this diversity among countries. In thesame way  we are called upon to aid in the fight againstterrorism  drug trafficking  transnational organizedcrime and other scourges that threaten internationalpeace and security in the more advanced countries. It isnot unreasonable  therefore  to expect reciprocity ofsupport in fighting the almost intractable problems thatconfront small States. To address these urgentchallenges  we call on the international community tosupport and contribute to the full  timely and effectiveimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy for furtherimplementation of the Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  which we consider a very important mechanismfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals.My Government was heartened by the Secretary-General's proposal for the establishment of a HumanRights Council. We also support effective change in theUnited Nations  which also means that the SecurityCouncil must evolve to reflect current world realities.The United Nations must also play a more enhancedrole in development  and the concerns of small islanddeveloping States must be given greater attentionwithin this Organization. Small States can offer best-practice models and creative ideas from which theinternational debate on development  peace  securityand human rights could benefit.We encourage greater transparency in thedeliberations of critical organs of the Organization andgreater opportunities for small States to be representedin the decision-making processes of these organs.The people of Taiwan continue to be excludedfrom the brotherhood of nations  which was created torepresent the hopes and aspirations of all peoples. MyGovernment reiterates its call for the people of theRepublic of China  Taiwan  to be consulted  effectivelyrepresented and invited to participate in the criticaldebates on world peace  human security  developmentand human rights. I believe that we would have failedto promote human rights effectively if  throughpolitical exclusion  generations of people are relegatedto the margins of such important issues and the forumsthat facilitate their discussion.I remain cautiously optimistic about the future.On the one hand  Governments have rededicatedthemselves to the struggle to build a world free fromwant and fear and with the freedom to live withdignity. In addition  we are poised to reform the UnitedNations in the hope that it can play a more effectiverole in this ever-changing world.However  the tenor of last week's summitsuggests a strong possibility that some developedcountries may yet renege on those commitments  whichcould further erode developing countries' efforts toeradicate extreme poverty  generate employment promote human security and narrow the developmentgap between richer and poorer countries.We still have an opportunity for an enhancedglobal partnership to turn commitments into action and4secure a future for our children  a future that is freefrom want of the basic necessities  free from fear ofviolence with guarantees of protection of the right tolive in dignity. Only then will we build and reinforcethe foundation of democracy  enhance collectivesecurity and jumpstart a process where globalizationbecomes a vehicle for change among all of the world'speoples."
"91",3844,"KOR",60,2005,"Let me begin  Sir by extending my sincere congratulations to you onassuming the presidency of the General Assembly at itssixtieth session. Well aware of your experience anddiplomatic skills  I have every confidence that underyour able leadership  we will achieve great resultsduring this important session  which marks the sixtiethanniversary of the United Nations. I would also like totake this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping  whose tireless workenabled the membership to successfully prepare for theHigh-level Plenary Meeting held last week. My highesttribute also goes to the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for his unqualifieddedication to our world body.The leaders of the world gathered here last weekin the largest summit meeting of States in history anddemonstrated their collective political will to overcomethe challenges of the present and to build a future ofpeace and prosperity for all humankind. Theyreaffirmed their commitment to achieving theMillennium Development Goals. They alsounderscored the vital role of the United Nations for ourtime and gave guidance on steps to reform theOrganization. The outcome document (resolution60/1)  adopted in the greatest spirit of cooperation andcompromise  may not be everything to everyone  but itis the guideline for action that our leaders have givenus. The task now is to implement it.The work will require determined action by all.Success will be ensured only when each and every oneof us strives to look beyond the immediate horizon. Wemust commit ourselves anew to realizing the ideal thatinspired the founders of the Organization 60 years ago that of building a peaceful and prosperous world in13which all peoples live together in harmony  free fromwant and fear.Certainly  with 30 000 children dying of hungeror preventable diseases every day  the world lies farfrom that ideal today. Everyone agrees that we have themeans to lift the whole world out of poverty andunderdevelopment. We just need to effectively putthose means to good use. Thus  the concrete  action-oriented recommendations adopted by our leaders onpartnership  financing  trade  debt relief and otheraspects of development are greatly welcome. We mustfully and speedily implement them so that  by the year2015  most of the world’s impoverished are freed fromhunger and poverty  the spread of HIV/AIDS is halted primary education is made universal for all children gender equality takes firm root in all societies and theglobal partnership to achieve those and otherdevelopment goals is in full operation.In particular  we welcome the timetables manydeveloped countries have presented for reaching thetarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national income forofficial development assistance (ODA) by 2015. TheRepublic of Korea is committed to doing its share.Despite the internal and external economic challengesthat my country has faced since the financial crisis of1997  we have continued to increase developmentassistance year after year  doubling our ODA between2000 and 2004. We now plan to double it again by2009.My Government is also seeking other ways tobuild partnerships with developing countries. Utilizingour resources and expertise in information andcommunication technology  we are working with theEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and thePacific to build and host an Asia-Pacific training centrefor information and communication technology  withan initial outlay of $10 million. The centre willcontribute to reducing the digital divide and enablingdeveloping countries to make the most of informationand communication technologies for development.Korea is also dedicated to good governance which is an essential ingredient of development. Thus we are working with the Secretariat to establish aUnited Nations governance centre in Seoul  as afollow-up to the Sixth Global Forum on ReinventingGovernment  which my Government hosted earlier thisyear.Health is another area that requires our collectiveaction. In our globalized  connected world  infectiousdiseases can spread with terrifying speed  with noregard for borders. They can become pandemics thatthreaten the development and the security of affectedcountries and regions. Here  too  the world must acttogether. For its part  my Government is contributing tothe Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis andMalaria.We are also vigorously supporting the activitiesof the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul  whichstrives to develop and disseminate vaccines mostneeded in the world’s poorest regions. And we havetaken part in the launching of the InternationalPartnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza announced by President Bush of the United States inhis speech here last week (see A/60/PV.2).As world leaders noted  the threats to peace andsecurity around the world today are increasing interconnected and global in scale. They require of usan urgent  collective and more determined response.Terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction (WMDs) and transnational crime are gravethreats that can be most effectively addressed whencountries act in concert under the United Nationsbanner.Cruel and inhuman acts of terrorism targetinginnocent lives  as witnessed in Iraq  the UnitedKingdom and elsewhere  are heinous crimes for whichthere can be no justification. The Republic of Korea isalready a party to all 12 international anti-terrorismconventions in force. Last week  I signed for myGovernment the International Convention for theSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism as soon as itwas opened for signature. We are strongly committedto preventing and eradicating international terrorism inall its forms. We will continue to actively participate inthe efforts to conclude a comprehensive convention oninternational terrorism as soon as possible.The proliferation of WMDs is another pressingsecurity concern. The prospect of WMDs falling intothe hands of terrorists is more alarming and real thanever before. The Republic of Korea is fully committedto the non-proliferation of WMDs. Thus  we aredismayed that the outcome document of the High-levelPlenary Meeting is silent on this vital issue. We verymuch hope for an early opportunity to redress thisomission. In the meantime  my Government will14continue to press for the strengthening of the nuclearcompliance and verification system. We call for theuniversal adoption of International Atomic EnergyAssociation (IAEA) additional protocols  thedisarmament and non-proliferation of biological andchemical weapons and the full implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004).In facing the threats of terrorism or WMDs  orany traditional threats  the Security Council must bemade to act more quickly and efficiently to situationsthat arise when the elements of a threat become reality.At the same time  the Security Council must exercisewith only the utmost prudence its prerogative tosanction the use of force. In that regard  we shouldbuild upon the agreement reflected in the outcomedocument on the establishment of principles for the useof force. That would lead to the strengthened relevanceand efficiency of the Security Council and of thecollective security system embodied in the UnitedNations as a whole.Peacekeeping has been an important part of thissystem. Indeed  the success of the peacekeepingmissions in such places as Timor-Leste has been one ofthe proudest achievements of the Organization inrecent years. However  there have been failures  aswell as cases of fragile peace being overtaken by theresumption of conflict. Shameful misconduct by somepeacekeeping operation personnel in certain missionshas added to the sense of disappointment. Obviously what is needed is a more structured and extensivemechanism to make the peace more durable andconsolidate the grounds for post-conflictreconstruction. In this regard  my Governmentwelcomes the decision taken at the High-level PlenaryMeeting to establish a Peacebuilding Commission.We hope to play our part  so that effectivepeacebuilding can become an important part of the roleof the United Nations to ensure peace and securityaround the world. This is very much in line with ourpast and current participation in efforts to restore peacein many challenged areas of the world  including inIraq  where we are helping the Iraqi people to build ademocratic and prosperous country.I would like to take this opportunity to addressthe current situation regarding the North Koreannuclear issue. After a 13-month hiatus  the fourthround of the six-party talks commenced on 26 July broke off for a recess and resumed last week. Duringthe talks  all participants agreed on the goal andprinciples of the denuclearization of the Koreanpeninsula. They conducted serious  in-depthconsultations to make substantive progress towardsrealizing that objective. For our part  the Republic ofKorea has made an earnest effort to expedite the talksand move them towards a resolution  including throughthe offer to supply 2 million kilowatts of electric powerto the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea directly addressing one of the most pressing problems it faces.As we are gathered here  the resumed fourthround is under way to adopt an agreement on theprinciples for the resolution of the North Koreannuclear issue. Once adopted  the agreement will be acrucial step towards the denuclearization of the Koreanpeninsula and will launch discussions on an action plantowards a peaceful resolution of the North Koreannuclear issue.A strategic decision by the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea to dismantle all nuclear weaponsand nuclear programmes would be met with economicand energy assistance and security assurances. NorthKorea must return to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and complywith the full scope of IAEA safeguards so as to restorethe trust of the international community. The doorswould then open to its right to peaceful use of nuclearenergy. We urge North Korea to take this road.The Republic of Korea is committed to promotinghuman rights as universal values that should beguaranteed to all. Based on our own experience of thepast decades  we know that development and securityare on shaky ground without full respect for the humanrights of all. We thus welcome the reform initiatives tostrengthen the United Nations human rights system andwholly support the creation of a Human RightsCouncil. We would have preferred to see strongerlanguage and greater detail about the composition mandate and functions of the Council spelled out in thesummit outcome document. Working closely with otherdelegations  we hope to promptly engage in activeconsultations so that the Council can be establishedand can start functioning as soon as possible.The Republic of Korea is also committed todemocracy at home and abroad. We are an activeparticipant in the Community of Democracies and havesupported the International Conference of New andRestored Democracies. We have pledged to contribute15to the United Nations Democracy Fund  and we willremain a strong supporter of the continuing mission ofthe United Nations to nurture and strengthendemocracy and human rights around the world.Respect for human rights and the rule of law areindispensable for the preservation of peace andcooperation among nations. Mass killings  genocideand other grave infringements of human rights arethreats to peace and stability and must not be let passwith impunity. The principle of the “responsibility toprotect”  as discussed during the High-level PlenaryMeeting  underscores the responsibility of theinternational community to lend assistance to States inupholding their solemn obligation to protect theircitizens. We support the continued deliberations byMember States to reach agreement on the responsibilityto protect. This would certainly form the backbone of apreventive mechanism against gross violations ofhuman rights.Earlier this month  Hurricane Katrina devastatedNew Orleans and the surrounding areas in the UnitedStates  causing massive casualties and tremendous painand suffering for the victims and their families. Onbehalf of the Government and people of the Republicof Korea  I would like to extend our deepestsympathies and condolences to those affected.Coming less than a year after the massive tsunamithat struck many countries of South-East Asia  Katrinaonce again mobilized the international community inbringing emergency relief to the victims. It alsounderscored the urgency of establishing effectivemechanisms to cope with natural disasters around theworld  including the importance of early warningsystems. With those lessons in mind  natural disasterswill be a primary issue for debate at the Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation summit meeting  which mycountry is hosting in Busan in November. Meanwhile we reaffirm our support for the reform of UnitedNations humanitarian aid agencies to enhance theirefficiency and effectiveness in helping countries torecover from disaster and rebuild their capacities forsustainable development.We mark the sixtieth anniversary of the UnitedNations with mixed feelings. On the one hand  there ismuch hope. It is the hope of the entire internationalcommunity for the United Nations to prevail over thenew challenges of the twenty-first century and toassume a more central role in strengthening peace andsecurity  promoting prosperity and spreadingdemocracy and human rights around the world. On theother hand  there is widespread disappointment. It hasbecome painfully clear that the United Nations as itstands today is unfit to carry out the demands of thesecomplex times. Between the hope and thedisappointment  there is much uncertainty. But of onething I am certain: all of us gathered here are united inthe conviction that the hope must triumph over thedisappointment; that we must rise to the occasion andmake the United Nations fit for the twenty-firstcentury.Indeed  our global body must be strengthenedwith far-reaching reforms that are in step with thedynamic challenges of a borderless and fluid world.Those reforms should be comprehensive —encompassing all the elements of the system — andrealized in such a way as to give all Members  largeand small  a sense of ownership in the process and theoutcome. Faithful to the guidance provided in theoutcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting and in synergistic cooperation with one another  allstakeholders — Member States  the Secretariat  thefunds and programmes  specialized agencies and otherconstituents of the United Nations system — mustseize this opportunity for renewal and revitalization.Indeed  we must engage in a genuine exercise inmultilateralism to strengthen our global body.Reform of the Security Council must be pursuedto enhance its accountability  transparency andefficiency. My delegation believes that increasing thenumber of non-permanent seats on the Council  with noaddition of permanent seats  is the best way to fosterbroad-based consensus on this vital issue.The Secretariat has long served the collective willand interests of the Member States of the UnitedNations. The contributions of those who have served inthe United Nations system with dedication andprofessionalism should be highly praised. However  thecredibility and integrity of the system have beendamaged by recent revelations of mismanagement andcorruption. The maladministration of the oil-for-foodprogramme  as Mr. Volcker stated in delivering hisfourth report to the Security Council  should not beseen as a lone case but as symptomatic of deep-seatedsystemic issues of an Organization designed forsimpler times. Reform  as he further stated  is urgent.Without bold reforms to restore the trust and support ofthe global community  enhance efficacy and improve16the morale of staff  the system will not be able to liveup to the growing expectations of the twenty-firstcentury.Underscoring the vital importance of this issue the High-level Plenary Meeting has fully endorsed themanagement reform initiatives taken by the Secretary-General. With the active support and encouragement ofMember States  those initiatives should quickly bearfruit  providing strengthened accountability andoversight  higher performance and ethical standards forstaff  and greater authority and responsibility for theSecretary-General as the chief administrative officer ofthe Organization.The challenges facing the United Nations todayare daunting. Some may find them insurmountable. Butwe are a country that was born and developedalongside the United Nations over the past 60 years receiving particularly active assistance from it inearlier decades. We have full confidence in the futureof the Organization. Now a maturing democracy thatupholds human rights  an emerging donor that seeks todo its share in helping others  and a staunch advocateof peace and effective multilateralism  the Republic ofKorea is fully committed to bringing greater vitalityand reliability to the United Nations.At the High-level Plenary the leaders of the worldgave us guiding words for making the United Nations amore effective and relevant instrument for realizing theaspirations of the global community in the twenty-firstcentury. We must not let those words remain justwords. Let us proceed with vigour and dedication toput them into action."
"92",3890,"KWT",60,2005,"A few days ago this Hall was the venue of an unprecedented landmark a historic gathering of a large number of heads of Stateor Government who converged to review and assessimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals to renew their commitment to the United Nations andthe principles of its Charter and to underline their faith10and conviction in the valuable contribution of theinternational Organization which  by promoting theprinciples of peace  security and prosperity  is buildinga better world — a world free of the problems andchallenges currently afflicting the internationalcommunity and forming a threat to world peace andsecurity. Those problems and challenges includeterrorism  poverty  hunger  the proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction  the spread of contagious diseases environmental degradation and the persistent andflagrant violation of human rights. The internationalgathering was an acknowledgement that multilateralismis the only viable option for addressing those issuesand challenges  whose implications and dangerstranscend geographical borders. Therefore  because oftheir nature  no country can confront them alone.Although Kuwait welcomes the adoption of theoutcome document (resolution 60/1) of the High-levelPlenary Meeting  we express our disappointment that itdid not include the issues of disarmament and non-proliferation. We hope that the international communitywill reach a consensus regarding the importance of fulland non-selective implementation of all disarmamenttreaties  particularly the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons  whose three main pillars are nucleardisarmament  non-proliferation and the peaceful uses ofnuclear energy. The international community mustredouble its efforts to totally eliminate all weapons ofmass destruction. We hope that the commitments andobligations agreed upon will be duly implemented.Kuwait  for its part  will fulfil its obligations andcomply with all relevant international conventions treaties and United Nations resolutions. We hope thatthe next few years will see significant strides in theefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goalsby 2015 and that our joint efforts will result in thestreamlining of international cooperation andcoordination mechanisms.In that context  Kuwait wishes to commend theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his efforts andinitiatives to reform the Secretariat with a view toenhancing its accountability and transparency andimproving the performance of United Nations staff inorder to meet the demands of the constantly changinginternational environment. Kuwait is activelyparticipating in the ongoing consultations on the reformof United Nations organs such as the General Assembly the Economic and Social Council and the SecurityCouncil.We hope that a consensus will eventually bereached on Security Council reform that will achieveour common goal: improving the Council's role andeffectiveness  so that it can fulfil its Charter mandate which is the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. Council reform should also ensure broaderrepresentation of regional groups  including inparticular Arab and Islamic representation  whichwould make Council resolutions more transparent andeffective.The phenomenon of terrorism has become adirect and immediate threat to international peace andsecurity. Its dangers have spread to affect manycountries throughout the world. The 11 September2001 attacks in the United States of America  theevents currently unfolding in Iraq and the recentbombings in London and Sharm el-Sheikh haveprovided indisputable proof that terrorism neither isassociated with  nor specifically targets  a particularrace  religion or culture. Therefore  the responsibilityfor combating terrorism is collective and must beshouldered by all Member States without exception.While the State of Kuwait reaffirms its principledposition rejecting terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations  we wish to emphasize the need tocombat terrorism within a framework of internationallegitimacy that recognizes the legitimate rights ofpeoples and brings about justice and stability. We alsostress the importance of commitment and adherence byMember States to the 12 international conventions onterrorism  as well as to the International Conventionfor the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism which Kuwait signed last Friday. We believe that thatis the ideal way to eliminate this phenomenon  to curbits effects and to tackle its root causes.In that regard  the State of Kuwait reaffirms itssupport for the proposal put forward by the Custodianof the Two Holy Mosques  King Abdullah BinAbdulaziz Al-Saud of the fraternal Kingdom of SaudiArabia  to establish an international centre to fightterrorism. We believe that such a centre would put inplace an effective mechanism for collecting andexchanging information on this phenomenon.Iraq continues to find itself in a critically difficultsituation of instability and insecurity because of thealmost daily terrorist attacks mounted by terroristgroups  including the vanquished fleeing remnantsloyal to the former Iraqi regime. Those terrorist attacks11largely impede the efforts of the Iraqi Government torebuild in the wake of the devastation left by theformer regime as a result of its hostile policies towardsits own people and neighbouring countries.The State of Kuwait continues to lend support toour brothers in Iraq with a view to rehabilitating andrebuilding their country. Our approach stems from ourbelief that stability in Iraq is ultimately in the interestof stability in this vital region of the world and wouldhave positive implications for its security and progress.We are fully confident that the fraternal people of Iraqwill eventually overcome this difficult period in theirhistory and that they will persist in building democraticinstitutions  in adopting the text of their newconstitution and in laying the ground for theforthcoming legislative elections.In the same vein  we wish to stress Kuwait'scommitment to the unity  sovereignty and politicalindependence of Iraq. The State of Kuwait looksforward to establishing solid fraternal relations withthe new Iraq on the basis of mutual respect  good-neighbourliness and adherence to bilateral agreements to the relevant United Nations resolutions and to theresolutions of international legitimacy  as theyconstitute the fundamental pillars of the new and futurerelationship between the two brotherly countries.Furthermore  we welcome the Iraqi Government'sdetermination to try the leaders of the former regimefor all the crimes against humanity that they havecommitted against the people of Iraq. The trials shouldalso cover the crimes committed against the Kuwaitipeople  including the invasion of the State of Kuwaitand the killing of Kuwaiti prisoners and third-countrynationals.Kuwait reaffirms its full support for the struggleof the Palestinian people to attain all their legitimatepolitical rights. Kuwait demands that Israel moveforward in fulfilling all its commitments andobligations under the relevant United Nationsresolutions  primarily Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973) and 1515 (2003)  in accordancewith the principle of land for peace and the provisionsof the Arab peace initiative  the bilateral accords itsigned with the Palestinian Authority within theframework of the peace process  and the road map with all its provisions and obligations. Israel must alsoend its policy of oppressing the Palestinian people dismantle the separation wall and release allPalestinian detainees.The State of Kuwait views the Israeli withdrawalfrom the Gaza Strip as a first step to be followed byadditional measures to be taken by Israel to end theoccupation  in compliance with the relevant UnitedNations resolutions and in preparation for theestablishment of an independent Palestinian State onPalestinian national soil  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as itscapital. Kuwait hopes that the Israeli withdrawal willlead to the resumption of peace efforts in the region toensure full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied SyrianArab Golan to the borderline of 4 June 1967 and itswithdrawal from the rest of the Arab territory insouthern Lebanon. Thereafter  a settlement should bereached through negotiations among all partiesconcerned to establish a just  comprehensive andlasting peace in the region — a peace that would beenhanced by making the Middle East region  includingthe Gulf region  a zone free of weapons of massdestruction.In view of Kuwait's keen interest in themaintenance of security and stability in the Gulf regionand given our close ties with the brotherly United ArabEmirates and with the friendly Islamic Republic ofIran  we support the position of the member States ofthe Gulf Cooperation Council regarding the threeislands of the United Arab Emirates. It is our hope thatthe two countries will agree on a negotiationmechanism to resolve their dispute over the threeislands  in accordance with the principles and norms ofinternational law and good neighbourly relations.It is our sincere hope that the resolutions on thepromotion of sustainable development adopted atnumerous international meetings and conferencesconvened by the United Nations and otherorganizations  as well as those goals in the High-levelPlenary Meeting's outcome document  will lay thegroundwork for a new partnership between thedeveloped and the developing nations  thuscontributing to the stability and the growth ofeconomic relations among those States. We also hopethat those resolutions will help create a balanced andfair international trading system in which each partyassumes its responsibilities.To create that kind of partnership  the economicstructures of the developing countries need to bestrengthened and the developed countries should fulfil12their pledges to provide financial and technicalassistance and alleviate and cancel the debts of thepoorest countries. They should also remove traderestrictions and tariffs on products made in poorcountries and give those countries access totechnology  enabling them to fully participate in thenew economic system. All these measures would helpput their peoples on the right track to development andprosperity.In that context  the State of Kuwait is proud tohave honoured all its international obligations. It willcontinue to support economic developmentprogrammes in developing countries through theKuwait Fund for Economic Development. For therecord  the Fund has so far extended $12 billion indevelopment assistance to more than 100 countries invarious regions of the world. Kuwait will also strive toensure the stability of global oil markets  with a viewto maintaining the pace of development and economicgrowth for all.As we observe the sixtieth anniversary of theestablishment of the United Nations  Kuwait remainshopeful  confident and optimistic about the role of theUnited Nations and its capability to deal withinternational issues that pose a threat to world peaceand security.To that noble end  the international communitymust rally behind the United Nations and forge aheadat an even faster pace. We look forward to sincere andmeaningful cooperation and partnership to tackle thecurrent challenges. Furthermore  we must strive tocreate a future characterized by the values and ideals offreedom  justice and equality which  together  underpinsecurity and stability across the world."
"93",3936,"LAO",60,2005,"At the outset I would like to congratulateyou upon your unanimous election as President of thesixtieth session of the General Assembly. I am confidentthat with your experience and diplomatic skills you willguide our deliberations to a successful outcome. Iwould also like to convey our great appreciation to HisExcellency Mr. Jean Ping  President of the fifty-ninthsession of the Assembly  for the efficient manner inwhich he presided over our work as well as for the fineaccomplishments recorded during the session.Sixty years after its creation  the United Nations our only multilateral Organization  is at a crossroads.When the Organization was established  the promotionof peace and security  as well as that of economic andsocial development  were its main objectives. It wasthen conceived to save succeeding generations fromthe scourge of war and insecurity  to reduce anderadicate poverty and to move towards economicprosperity for all.Today  the world is still filled with conflicts violence  insecurity  hunger  poverty and despair. Wehave therefore every reason to act collectively toreform and strengthen this multilateral institution toenable it to effectively address the many complexchallenges the world is now facing.In this reform process  revitalizing the GeneralAssembly has now become one of the crucial issues forconsideration by Member States. In our opinion  theAssembly  which comprises all the Members of theUnited Nations  should continue to play a central roleas the chief deliberative  policy-making andrepresentative organ. It should serve as a forum forhigh-level policy statements  as well as for theconsideration  of  inter alia  agenda items of specialpolitical importance or urgency. In order to strengthenthe role and authority of the General Assembly Member States should stress the need to fully respectand restore the balance between the principal organs ofthe United Nations  within their respective purviewsand mandates  in accordance with the Charter.At the Millennium Summit in 2000  the leaders ofthe States Members of the United Nations resolved tostrive for the elimination of weapons of massdestruction  particularly nuclear weapons. In thisregard  we regret that the seventh Review Conferenceof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT)  held in New York from 2 to27 May 2005  was unable to reach consensus on thesubstantive questions relating to the three pillars of theTreaty. The Lao People's Democratic Republic is of theview that all States parties should remain committed tothe NPT and believes that it should continue to havecornerstone status in the context of global disarmamentand the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.The world economy continues to be characterizedby slow and uneven growth and instability.Globalization may offer a great many opportunities to anumber of countries. However  it also presentsnumerous challenges and risks for the developingworld  particularly the most vulnerable groups  namely the least developed countries and the landlockeddeveloping countries. In reality  the process ofglobalization among and within countries has notproduced equal benefits. The gap between thedeveloped and developing world is widening  and weare all greatly concerned about increased poverty inmany developing countries.In order for developing countries to reap thebenefits of globalization  an enabling externaleconomic environment for development is required. Tothat end  we should all strive to achieve greatercoherence among the international trading  monetaryand financial systems.Among the most vulnerable groups  thelandlocked developing countries deserve specialattention. The Almaty Programme of Action  whichwas adopted in 2003  was a landmark document thatset out five priority areas. The Sao Paulo Consensus which was adopted in 2004 by the eleventh UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development recognized  among other things  that the landlockeddeveloping countries were small and vulnerableeconomies. Those documents  together with therelevant General Assembly resolutions  constitute asignificant achievement on which the Group ofLandlocked Developing Countries is building in orderto move forward in promoting its legitimate cause. Inmy capacity as Chairman of that Group  I appeal to theinternational community for sympathy and support forour endeavours.In order to strengthen unity and solidarity amongthe countries of the South  and as a follow-up to the6implementation of the Havana Programme of Action adopted by the first South Summit in 2000  the secondSouth Summit of the Group of 77 and China was heldin Doha  Qatar  from 12 to 16 June 2005. The DohaDeclaration and Plan of Action  which were adopted atthe second South Summit  called for a more energeticeffort to deepen and revitalize South-Southcooperation  with a view to enhancing sustainedeconomic growth and the sustainable development ofthe countries of the South.Last April in Jakarta  Indonesia  the Asian-AfricanSummit was held with the objective of reinvigorating thespirit of the 1955 Bandung Conference and of chartingfuture cooperation between the two continents towardsa new Asian-African strategic partnership. Thatpartnership  which was inaugurated at the Summit constitutes an important building block for the furtherstrengthening of South-South cooperation.I would like commend Mr. Kofi Annan  theSecretary-General  for his tireless efforts to ensure thesuccess of the High-level Plenary Meeting of theGeneral Assembly. The Lao People's DemocraticRepublic highly values the outcome document adoptedby our heads of State or Government  in which theyreaffirmed the Millennium Declaration and theircommitment to implementing effectively and fully theBrussels Programme of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries and the Almaty Programme of Action:Addressing the Special Needs of LandlockedDeveloping Countries within a New Global Frameworkfor Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked andTransit Developing Countries.Given the aspirations of the overwhelmingmajority of Member States  the second South Summit held in Doha  called upon the Government of theUnited States to put an end to the economic commercial and financial embargo against Cuba which  in addition to being unilateral and contrary tothe Charter  international law and the principle of goodneighbourliness  is the cause of enormous material lossand economic damage to the people of Cuba.On the Korean Peninsula  we welcome the recentresumption of the six-party talks  which have yieldedimportant progress. The Lao People's DemocraticRepublic expresses the hope that the concerned partieswill further deploy joint efforts and undertake concreteactions based on the principles and commitmentscontained in the Joint Declaration of 19 September2005 on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-freeKorean Peninsula  thus contributing to the promotionof peace  security  stability and developmentcooperation in the wider Asia-Pacific region.In the Middle East  although the situation remainsdifficult and complex  a degree of progress has beenmade that ought to be further promoted. In order toachieve a comprehensive and lasting peace in theregion  the question of Palestine in all its aspectsshould be resolved in accordance with international lawand relevant United Nations resolutions. In this regard the Lao People's Democratic Republic reaffirms itsunwavering support for the legitimate struggle of thePalestinian people  under the leadership of thePalestine Liberation Organization  to exercise theirright to self-determination  including their right toestablish an independent State of Palestine living sideby side with Israel.The situation in Iraq continues to be a matter ofconcern to the international community. It is oursincere hope that durable peace  security and stabilitycan soon be secured in that country  paving the way forthe Iraqi people to be truly the masters of their ownfuture and destiny.The year 2005 marks the thirtieth anniversary ofthe proclamation of the Lao People's DemocraticRepublic  a historic event of great significance in thepolitical life of the nation. In general  the nationaleconomy is continuing to grow at a sustained pace. Therate of growth reached 7.2 per cent in the period 2004-2005. Foreign investment is on the increase  politicalstability  social tranquillity and security are assuredand the living conditions of the people are continuingto improve. The multi-ethnic Lao people  whileenjoying fundamental rights  including the right tobelieve or not to believe in any religion  stand firmlyunited in nation-building. Furthermore  the Lao People'sDemocratic Republic remains committed to implementinga policy aimed at establishing a State based on the ruleof law so as to ensure freedom  democracy and thelegitimate interests of its citizens  as well as of foreignresidents and other foreigners living and working in theLao People's Democratic Republic.Externally  the Lao People's Democratic Republichas vigorously participated in multifaceted regionaland international activities aimed at fostering peace stability  friendship and the promotion of developmentcooperation. One of the greatest events for the Lao7People's Democratic Republic was the historic hostingof the tenth Summit of the Association of SoutheastAsian Nations (ASEAN) in November 2004  whichwas followed by the successful holding  from 24 to 29July 2005  of the thirty-eighth ASEAN MinisterialMeeting  the post-ministerial conferences and thetwelfth ASEAN Regional Forum. Those events reflectthe great sense of responsibility of the multi-ethnic Laopeople as a whole in the discharge of the country'schairmanship of ASEAN during the past 12 months.Furthermore  those accomplishments havesignificantly contributed to narrowing the developmentgaps within ASEAN member countries and fosteringthe realization of an ASEAN community. Thatcommunity has three pillars: the ASEAN SecurityCommunity  the ASEAN Economic Community andthe ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community  all of whichare closely intertwined and mutually reinforcing for thepurpose of ensuring durable peace  stability and sharedprosperity in the region.ASEAN hopes that friendly countries and theUnited Nations will become more involved in theimplementation of the Vientiane Action Programme andthe ASEAN Development Fund for regional economicintegration  particularly in the areas of human resourcedevelopment  infrastructure  information technologyand energy development.Peace cannot be achieved without development and development in turn cannot be realized withoutcooperation among nations  with the United Nationsplaying an important catalytic role.The United Nations - the sole multilateral universal Organization - cannot be strengthened however  if it does not embrace  in equal measure  theconcerns of all  including the small  vulnerable  andweak States  which make up the majority of itsMembers. In that respect  we should all remindourselves that not only will our words and theprinciples we espouse be judged by future generations but so  too  will the actions that we undertake to bringabout development for the whole of humanity."
"94",3979,"LBN",60,2005,"Mr. President  first of all  Iwould like to congratulate you on your election asPresident of this session of the General Assembly andto thank your predecessor  Mr. Ping  for all his effortsduring his tenure. I would like also to thank theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for all hisendeavours in seeking the preservation of this greatinstitution’s integrity as well as world peace.This year’s session of the General Assemblycomes days after a landmark meeting of world leadersat which they adopted a blueprint that aims to increasethe efficiency of the United Nations in the prosecutionof human rights abuses and in the preservation ofworld peace and security. Moreover  that instrumentcalls on all to move forward with a much-needed comprehensive programme of reforms at the UnitedNations  including in the Security Council.This clearly demonstrates our faith in the primacyof the role of the United Nations in the preservation ofworld peace  as the embodiment of our collectivedesire and will  and as the legitimate body for crisisresolution within the framework of every individualState’s sovereignty.Truly  the only way out of this dangerous impasseis a return to a multipolar world order  based on therule of international law and justice and on respect forevery nation’s sovereignty. Moreover  such a wiseapproach should be complemented by serious andconcerted efforts to fight poverty and oppression and consequently  the root causes of terror.The core values of a democratic and just worldare best served by enhancing the capabilities of theUnited Nations and its instruments  and by reinforcingin-house democratic values. This institution shouldremain the primary defender of such human values asfreedom  justice and peace.The advances in telecommunications andinformation technologies  signature traits ofglobalization  have led to a withering of geographicalboundaries  along with a strengthening of multinationalcorporations  and hence the need for a new approach totackling our world’s problems in internationalrelations. The “crumbs” from the rich nations havebecome insufficient to satisfy the needs of a thirdworld seeking to extract itself from backwardness andto eradicate poverty and disease. Those ailments havespread beyond the boundaries of the great developmentdivide and serve as a stern wake-up call and a tickingbomb for us all to heed.That is why it is imperative to call for a seriousand urgent dialogue between North and South  forrapid and eased transfer of technological advances andcapital  and for bolstering the development of thosenations that seek modernity. Moreover  it is crucial toencourage interaction and cooperation betweendeveloping States through such forums as the summitthat was held in Brasilia last May  where Arab nationsmet the nations of South America. Lebanon looksforward to the follow-up meetings of the Brasiliasummit  considering the importance of cooperationbetween those two important geographic blocs.At this juncture  it is logical to ask whetherextremism  terrorism and wanton violence againstinnocent civilians are the by-products of theenvironment of seclusion and deprivation. In view ofthe rapid spread of terrorism  we feel that the approachto countering the plague of terrorism remainssuperficial and unable to tackle the root causes of theplague.Having suffered the awful consequences of thatplague  Lebanon was always a bellwether incondemning all terrorist acts around the world. That isbecause few nations have so endured and continue toendure the consequences of that evil. That is why weknow that an effective anti-terror campaign requires anenvironment of constructive cooperation worldwide remote from politically motivated campaigns ofvilification  and as a platform for a clear definition of7terrorism  remote from the wilful or unintendedconflation of the inalienable right of people to fightoccupation and acts of wanton terror.Therefore  and in order to conclusively win thewar on terror  the security approach should becomplemented by mid- and long-term approachesaimed at resolving political crises in order to deprivethe terrorists of all legitimacy. That is why tackling theproblems of oppression and occupation  along withbolstering development  education and the attainmentof a better life  will surely lead to shrinking the humanpool that feeds extremism.For decades now  the Middle East has witnessedconflicts and unresolved disputes and  as aconsequence  has been subject to the festering woundsof terrorism. Needless to say  the core of the problemremains the fact that Arab lands are still underoccupation in spite of the many resolutions ofinternational legitimacy  many adopted in this veryedifice  calling for an end to occupation.The immediate implementation of thoseresolutions  as well as General Assembly resolution194 (III) — which affirms the right of return of thePalestinian refugees to their lands confiscated by Israeland bars the resettlement of the uprooted Palestiniansin their host countries — remains the only way todefuse and to dry up the wells of extremism. That willpave the way to a comprehensive  just and peacefulsettlement in our region  as foreseen in the 1991Madrid peace summit and the implementation of theland-for-peace principle.Those principles of peace were confirmed as astrategic choice by all Arab leaders during the BeirutArab summit of 2002. Sadly  the initiative has yet to beseized upon to resolve regional conflicts and to achievea final and peaceful settlement in the Middle East.Awaiting the historic resolution of the conflict Lebanon commends the United Nations Relief andWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near Eastfor all that it does  and calls upon the internationalcommunity to bolster its capabilities in order toalleviate the hardships of the Palestinian refugees intheir places of “temporary” residence.The daily Israeli violations of Lebanon’sterritorial integrity and aggressions against the peopleof South Lebanon have made that important part of mycountry yet another point of tension in the Middle East.Israel’s violation of the Blue Line and its continuingoccupation of parts of my country  along with theimprisonment of scores of our citizens without anyrecourse to due process  are in clear violation ofinternational law  to say nothing of the lethal hardshipsfaced by our citizens in the freed areas of SouthLebanon due to the thousands of land mines planted byIsrael during its two-decade occupation of SouthLebanon.My country continues to adhere to acomprehensive and just peace settlement  to theprinciple of non-aggression  and to respect for humanrights  and yearns for the implementation of allinternational resolutions towards those ends. In themeantime  we cannot but value the role played by theUnited Nations in South Lebanon through the UnitedNations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) — a rolethat has been extended to and benefited Lebanon foralmost three decades. Our clinging to the UNIFILpresence emanates from our commitment to peace andsecurity  pending a final resolution of the conflicts inthe region.Here  I would like to avail myself of theopportunity to salute the UNIFIL forces active in SouthLebanon  to thank them for their sacrifices  and to bowin memory of the fallen peacekeepers.Lebanon has long endured Israel’s wars andoccupation  despite a Security Council resolutioncalling for the immediate cessation of the occupation.Alas  Israel ignored that resolution for over twodecades. That gave birth to a staunchly nationalmovement of resistance and defence of Lebanon’sterritorial integrity  as guaranteed by the Charter of theUnited Nations under the right to fight occupation.Despite the persistence of all the aforementionedconditions of occupation  violations and aggressions and due to Lebanon’s adherence to all resolutions ofinternational legitimacy — an adherence based on aclear understanding of the world community’sdemands — the Government of Lebanon launched aninternal dialogue between all Lebanese groups in orderto maintain our unity  security and stability  and toreinforce our internal and international positions. Welook forward to maintaining that rapport with the worldcommunity in order to achieve those noble goals.Since the historic reconciliation at Taef  Lebanonhas enjoyed over a decade of stability and tranquillity quickly recapturing its regional pre-eminence and its8pioneering role as a land of religious tolerance — anexample to follow in the dialogue of civilizations.Moreover  Lebanon has enjoyed an unprecedentedlevel of economic revitalization and has been able toforge iron-clad unity in its armed forces and civilinstitutions.However  Lebanon has recently gone throughsome horrific and fateful events  one of which — theassassination of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri —constitutes the hardest blow in its modern history. Thatassassination caused great grief for our nation  and therepercussions were felt throughout the world. We lookforward to the timely and prompt disclosure of theInternational Inquiry Commission’s results of theinvestigation into that heinous act  and we thank theSecurity Council for consenting to Lebanon’s requestto appoint such a Commission.Moreover  Lebanon appreciates the great effortsundertaken by the Inquiry Commission in its search forthe truth  and will afford the Commission all thesupport that it needs in order for us to prosecute theculprits to the full extent of the law. That underlinesthe commitment of Lebanon and of the worldcommunity in the fight against terrorism.Despite the abominable assassination of PrimeMinister Rafik Hariri and the ensuing national malaise we were able to conduct exemplary parliamentaryelections  which have been heralded by most observersas yet another landmark in the democratic history ofLebanon.United Nations and international monitoringofficials testified that those elections were held inaccordance with the highest standards. Consequently  aGovernment of national unity has been formed  whichhas taken upon itself the task of immediately tacklingLebanon’s internal and external affairs  within theframework of a serious dialogue aimed at achieving anational consensus and the preservation of what we alldesire  namely  Lebanon’s stability and national unity.The new Lebanese Government is determined toundertake a comprehensive plan of reform that willencompass all political  administrative and economicaspects  and as a first step it has established a much-needed consultative national body to formulate a newelectoral law that will live up to the recommendationsof the European Union’s delegated commission.Moreover  the Lebanese Government looksforward to the valuable support of the United Nations and conveys the gratitude of the people of Lebanon.Finally  we commend the precise follow-up providedby the World Bank and the International MonetaryFund for the rebuilding of a solid national economy.From this rostrum  we set forth Lebanon’sstruggle for freedom  justice and the rule of law. It hasbeen Lebanon’s fate to walk this path in a region offestering  decades-long conflicts and disputes. As such it has ended up paying an exorbitant price in wars occupations and assassinations. But Lebanon has beenrelentless in its devotion to what is good and right  andhas always been able to defeat the forces of seditionand destruction.Today  we owe our moment of triumph to ourperseverance and to the international community’scommitment to Lebanon. We ask that you take ourhand  once again  as we cross the threshold from fearand war to hope and peace."
"95",4070,"LBY",60,2005,"It gives me great pleasure at the outset toaffirm my delegation’s confidence that the Swedishleadership of the work of the current General Assemblysession will help us achieve the best results. I alsoseize this opportunity to commend the efforts made byGabon  represented by its Foreign Minister  during itsleadership of the previous session. I would also like toreiterate our gratitude for the efforts made bySecretary-General Kofi Annan to advance the march ofUnited Nations reform and achieve the goals enshrinedin its Charter.Since the 1970s  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya hasbeen fully aware of the need to reform the UnitedNations and was the first State to put forward officialproposals to the General Assembly in that regard presenting draft resolutions from the thirty-fourth tothe fortieth sessions aimed at reforming the SecurityCouncil and abolishing the veto privilege. Though theLibyan proposals were not successful because of theobjection of the super-Powers  they did  however create a wide understanding of that issue within theGeneral Assembly  resulting in the adoption of aresolution at its forty-seventh session establishing anopen-ended group to review the issue of fairrepresentation in the Security Council and expandingits membership. We participated actively in the group’swork  but its activities reached an impasse.We felt hopeful over the last few years while wewere conducting consultations at all levels in order torealize a radical reform for the United Nations system in the service of international peace and security.However  as the date of our summit-level meeting thisyear approached  it became evident that the reform wesought remained elusive. This is because some of theprivileged Powers of the Security Council do not wishto give up their privileges — in fact not even to sharethese privileges with others.The victorious countries in the Second World Wararrogated rights and privileges for themselves at thetime the Charter was drawn up. This led to themarginalization of the General Assembly and renderedthe Security Council a domineering body —inequitable  unbalanced and undemocratic  with theveto privilege greatly abused. The United Nations therefore  has been unable to administer justice amongnations; in fact  some of its decisions have inflictedharm on many peoples.As we discuss United Nations reform  we shouldtake into consideration that its membership has nowreached 191 States. New global problems haveemerged  in addition to the old ones. Thus  it is2necessary to place the power of decision-making in thehands of all Members of the United Nations  that is  inthe hands of the General Assembly  in which all Stateshave equal votes. However  if such an agreement is notpossible  we should seek a new formula for permanentmembership in the Security Council.In this respect  we propose that permanentmembership be accorded to geographical groups  not tospecific States. We also propose that the African Unionbe granted permanent membership even before thecomprehensive reform has been decided  given the factthat Africa is the only continent without a countryholding permanent membership in the SecurityCouncil.As a member of the African Union  we affirm ouradherence to the common African position  adopted bythe Fifth African Union Summit  held in Sirte  Libya on 4 and 5 July 2005. This position was confirmed inthe African Union’s Extraordinary Summit on UnitedNations Reform held in Addis Ababa on 4 August2005.Libya believes that the elimination of weapons ofmass destruction is a fundamental factor in confidence-building and the consolidation of international peaceand security. Hence  Libya declared on l9 December2003 its voluntary renunciation of the programmes andmaterials that could lead to the production ofinternationally prohibited weapons and their means ofdelivery. Since that date  it has been cooperating in atransparent manner with the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA) and the Organization for theProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Allrelevant materials and equipment have been disposedof with the knowledge of experts from the IAEA andthe OPCW.Libya is now party to all internationalconventions on weapons of mass destruction  as well asthe code of ethics concerning ballistic missiles. Wehope that members of the international community willcooperate in a more appropriate manner to eliminateweapons of mass destruction  acquired by all States without discrimination  in order to create a world inwhich peace and security prevail.The Libyan declaration was a culmination ofprevious Libyan efforts undertaken in this field starting with effective participation in theestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone inAfrica — through its accession to the PelindabaTreaty — and the call to make the Middle East a zonefree of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of massdestruction.We confirm our readiness to continue our fullcooperation with all international organizations in thisfield and emphasize Libya’s right to expand itsprogramme of peaceful uses of nuclear energy fordevelopment  particularly in the fields of medicine agriculture  desalination  mining and oil exploration.We hope that all countries in the region would place alltheir nuclear facilities under the IAEA inspectionregime.Our country is concerned with human rightsissues at the international and national levels. We dealwith all organizations working in the field of humanrights in a transparent manner. We have donated 2million dinars to support the activities of the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights  and we are now reviewing some of our nationallegislation that is not in conformity with internationalinstruments in the field of human rights. We also haveeliminated the People’s Court  established in the earlyyears of the revolution  and its jurisdiction has beenassigned to regular courts.Libya was among the first States that called forthe coordination of international efforts to combatinternational terrorism and that proposed anextraordinary session of the General Assembly to studythat phenomenon and to develop measures to combat itand eradicate its causes.Libya has condemned terrorism in all its forms including State terrorism  ratified all international andregional conventions concerning terrorism and iscooperating actively with the committee established bythe Security Council on that subject. We believe thatthe eradication of terrorism requires practical measuresto eliminate its causes. Among such actions  we shouldactively strengthen human rights protections for allpeople  confront all acts of aggression and occupationof the lands of others  fight poverty and encouragedemocracy.Terrorism cannot be uprooted unilaterally throughactions taken by one State or group of States. Thesolution for such a problem cannot be achieved bylinking it to a certain religion or nationality. It is notfair that the legitimate struggle of peoples to achieveself-determination and independence should beclassified as terrorism. We should all exert and3coordinate all our possible efforts under the umbrellaof the United Nations to combat terrorism andcomplete  as early as possible  a comprehensivecounter-terrorism treaty.My country was subjected to unjust sanctions thatcaused great material losses totalling about $40 billion.Now  while this matter has ended and the reasonbehind the sanctions settled  I extend my gratitude toall the friendly and sisterly countries that stood by ourside and supported our position in tackling thatsituation.Competent Libyan authorities are now drawingup plans for restructuring the Libyan economy and arereviewing the public sector  encouraging the privatesector and providing opportunity for all to engage ineconomic activities. New economic policies wereadopted in order to advance the national economy eliminate deficiencies and improve performance.Certain measures have been taken in the monetaryfield  including the adoption of a single exchange ratefor the Libyan dinar against foreign currencies  theabolition of monetary control and a reduction ofincome taxes. Import and export licences as well ascustoms guarantees on exports have been abolished ashave customs fees on approximately 3 500 importeditems.Important steps have been taken for theprivatization of many public sector companies. Libyahas opened its doors to investors and a law for theencouragement of foreign investment has beenpromulgated. This law gives foreign investors manyprivileges and exemptions and allows them 100 percent ownership of their enterprises or partnership withdomestic investors. Our application to join the WorldTrade Organization was approved unanimously by theorganization on 27 July 2004. We seek furthercooperation from all countries in that respect.The consolidation and realization of peace andsecurity for all is a fundamental goal of the UnitedNations. It is an objective that could not be realized bythe Organization without the assistance andcooperation of all Member States  which could beeffective tools to solve the most difficult problems andconflicts among countries  particularly in Africa. Inthis respect  we wish to express our satisfaction withthe stabilization of the situation in Sierra Leone andAngola and the improvement of the situation inSomalia  Burundi and the Democratic Republic of theCongo  as well as the signing of the peace agreement inSudan.We call on all Member States to assist the AfricanUnion in its endeavours to face its various challengesand create a unified African continent capable ofachieving progress and participating effectively in themarch towards progress  upholding freedom andhuman rights and eradicating wars  poverty and diseasewhile removing the remnants of colonialism. We hopethat support will be extended to the African Union’splans to achieve prosperity for all African people byproviding assistance to the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development.The international community so far has failed tosolve the Palestinian problem  although it is as old asthe United Nations itself. In fact  the problem is gettingworse. The Palestinian people have lived for over halfa century either as refugees all over the world orsubjected to an occupying Power  which has usurpedits land and practiced against them the most horriblecrimes  including the killing of children  women andthe elderly. Their lands have been confiscated  theirfarms burned  their trees uprooted  their housesdestroyed over their occupants  while houses are builtfor settlers coming from all over the world. Eventhough highly sophisticated weapons are being usedagainst civilians  the Security Council stands unable totake concrete steps to stop such practices. This hasencouraged the occupying Power to continue itsaggression and crimes  heedless of the decisions of theinternational community.The suffering of the Palestinian people requiresthat urgent and firm action be taken by theinternational community to put an end to the Israeliaggression and provide a radical solution for thePalestinian question.We believe that the solution cannot be achievedby accepting a de facto situation or by merely adoptingresolutions or unrealizable plans. It will happenthrough a radical solution that allows and guaranteesthe return of all Palestinian refugees to their lands andthe establishment of a democratic State on the land ofhistorical Palestine in which Jews and Arabs live sideby side  enjoying full equality  similar to the SouthAfrican model  where blacks and whites reconciledafter decades of conflict and bloodshed. If such asolution is not realized  with the support of theinternational community  the suffering of the4Palestinian people will continue  and the region willcontinue to witness tension and conflict without peaceand security.The Israeli occupation forces must withdraw fromall occupied Arab territories; the Golan Heights mustbe returned to Syrian sovereignty and the Shabaa farmsto Lebanon.In Iraq  where international law has been violatedand the country subjected to occupation on unfoundedbases and flimsy pretexts  the tragedy is escalatingdaily  getting more and more difficult to solve. TheIraqi people are paying a high price with the lives oftheir sons and daughters as a result of the occupation.We have to exert every possible effort to guarantee aspeedy end to the occupation in order to enable Iraq toregain its independence and sovereignty and preserveits territorial integrity and Arab identity. The Iraqismust be allowed to determine their own affairs  futureand manage their resources  and to achieve self-determination with freedom involving all citizenswithout the marginalization of any group so that peace prosperity and security can prevail all over Iraq."
"96",4103,"LCA",60,2005,"Saint Lucia supportedyour unanimous election  Sir  to be President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session  confident thatyour diplomatic skills and experience are just what weneed to ensure a positive outcome of this historicsixtieth anniversary session. I congratulate you and theGovernment and people of Sweden on behalf of thedelegation of Saint Lucia and on my own behalf andpledge our cooperation to you in our commonendeavour.My Government and delegation also extend ourthanks to your predecessor in office  His ExcellencyMr. Jean Ping  for his stewardship of the fifty-ninthsession of the General Assembly  charged as it waswith the preparatory work for this sixtieth anniversary.In these times  when the demands on the UnitedNations are significant and increasing  resourceslimited and we  the Member States  are called upon tostrengthen our cooperation and keep detractors andcynics of the Organization at bay  my Governmentwishes to express its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continuing support for the work of theUnited Nations.In this sixtieth year of the United Nations  ourworld is certainly not the prosperous and peaceful onebuilt on the unity and strength of nations that theCharter envisaged. Should we conclude  therefore  thathad the United Nations exerted more authoritativeinfluence in global affairs  our twenty-first centuryworld would be a better one? Such an assertion seemsplausible in today’s world  replete with poverty and19hunger  disease  lack of sustainable development human rights violations  terrorism  conflict and war glaring inadequacies and a multitude of other graveproblems  including the unfinished agenda ondecolonization.The record of the United Nations  however  doesnot bear out so simplistic an assertion. If we look withhistorical retrospection at the Organization’s record  wesee that it has wielded enormous influence over theyears. The challenge that we Member States must takeup at this sixtieth anniversary is to ensure that theUnited Nations  the key Organization in global affairs has the authority and prestige to anticipate and meetchallenges of the nature and scale we are witnessing intoday’s world.Development is foremost among the challengesthat Member States have identified for urgent attentionduring this sixtieth anniversary. There is logic in thisapproach. A significant proportion of the criticalproblems that the world faces now and in the future isintrinsically linked to development. It is for this reasonthat heads of State or Government  in their MillenniumDeclaration  defined succinctly what must be done toadvance socio-economic development in areas of vitalconcern.As we know  this comprehensive blueprintunderpins the Millennium Development Goals. Theglobal leadership was sufficiently confident to placetheir Goals within specified time frames  understandingas they did the desperate need for improvement in thesocio-economic conditions in numerous developingcountries.What will we  the Member States of this UnitedNations  say to the people of the developing worldgrappling with poverty  hunger  HIV/AIDS and otherdeadly diseases  illiteracy  gender discrimination andother challenges if  by the date set  we have not met thetargets of the Millennium Development Goals? MyGovernment sees no merit in the discussion as towhether target dates should have been set. Ourorientation should now be towards accelerating thepace of implementation so that the Goals can beaccomplished within agreed time frames  or better stilleven earlier than the target dates.The United Nations must also show the people ofthe developing world that comprehensive measures arebeing taken to address the environment and sustainabledevelopment. Natural disasters of phenomenalproportions — from Hurricane Ivan in the Caribbean tothe tsunami in Asia and now to Hurricane Katrina inthe southern United States — have brought death anddestruction to developing and developed countriesalike. I take this opportunity on behalf of theGovernment and people of Saint Lucia to extend oursympathy to the Government of the United States forthe tragedy still unfolding in the Gulf Coast states.Resource-rich developed countries are betterpositioned to mitigate the impact of natural disasters although they too are not without their challenges. Fordeveloping countries  however  including Saint Luciaand other small island developing States in theCaribbean and Pacific  decades of progress can beobliterated in the course of a few hours by onehurricane or typhoon. Beyond doubt the environment isa critical element of the United Nations developmentagenda. It is a compelling reason for all to sign on tothe Kyoto Protocol.It is also in our common interest to meet all thecommitments made in the Monterrey Consensus onFinancing for Development. In many instances however  expectations are not being realized.Developing countries still cannot rely on wide-rangingdevelopment cooperation and assistance and debtreduction responses that are predictable and reliable.Needless to say my Government joins in urging thedeveloped countries that have not already done so tomeet the 0.7 per cent target. We recognize the G-8initiative to take enhanced measures for Africa’sdevelopment and hope that that initiative would bespeedily implemented.Related to concern for the development and well-being of all the world’s people  the Government ofSaint Lucia commends the establishment of the$1 billion emergency fund to be finalized later thisyear  which will enable the Organization to morequickly and effectively respond to humanitarian crises.This sixtieth anniversary provides us with yetanother opportunity to give impetus to initiatives tospread the benefits of globalization and tradeliberalization more widely. Priority must be given toensuring that all developing countries benefit fromfreer world trade  that a decline in their trade sector behalted and reversed and that the competition they facein the world economy be on a level playing field.I am really tired of saying this — that one sizecannot fit all  an indisputable fact that the World Trade20Organization stubbornly refuses to acknowledge withrespect  inter alia  to bananas and sugar in CaribbeanCommunity and small island developing States.Indeed  the cause of development would be greatlyenhanced by a positive outcome from the next round ofthe Doha trade negotiations scheduled for Hong Kong China  in December 2005  and an early and successfulconclusion of the round overall  hopefully in 2006.Developing countries must be equal partners inthis process  and together with the developed countriestake the decisive action required at the World TradeOrganization.What my Government seeks to emphasize bydrawing attention to the development imperative is thatthe time has come for a paradigm shift in the UnitedNations approach to development. For more than adecade we have  through a series of United Nationssummits and conferences in the economic and socialfields  formulated an agreed framework of a UnitedNations development agenda  which includes theMillennium Development Goals.To these we have now added the outcomedocument of the sixtieth anniversary summit. Are thesecourses of action that we have agreed upon to beregarded as mere platitudes  destined to be relegated tothe archives of the United Nations? The developingcountries have communicated through the Group of 77and China that the partnership and cooperation of thecountries of the developed world  and indeed allstakeholders  are urgently needed to accelerate actionand implementation of the United Nations developmentagenda. This sixtieth anniversary  we believe  has aresponsibility to launch this process afresh and to carryout the commitments that we have made in thisdevelopment agenda.A more influential Economic and Social Counciland a United Nations development system that isstrong and cohesive would ensure that the Organizationimplements its development mandate effectively.Making the United Nations responses equal to itschallenges through reform and revitalization was animportant element of our deliberations in thepreparatory process for this sixtieth anniversary.Let me say that my Government is prepared toactively work together with other Member States to setprecise and unambiguous mandates for new orreconstituted bodies  including a PeacebuildingCommission and Human Rights Council  on the basisof consensus. It is our considered opinion however thata credible process of United Nations reform must resultin a strong General Assembly  the Organization’s soleuniversal organ from which no Member State can be oris excluded.We can ill afford to further erode the GeneralAssembly’s role and authority  since the Charterconfirms in a practical sense the importance of theAssembly by the expansive mandate that it has beengiven in areas that include the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. No other organ hasbeen given such broad responsibilities nor has thepotential to deliver over such a wide range of Charterideals. We are also convinced that a strong GeneralAssembly would enhance the credibility and standingof the United Nations as a whole. Therefore  themomentum of General Assembly revitalization must bemaintained  and our efforts in this area must be asdynamic and flexible as are the forces shaping today’sworld.Reform of the Security Council has also been amajor preoccupation in the lead up to this sixtiethanniversary  as it has been for some 12 years. Anindisputable case has been made for the expansion ofthe Council to reflect the exponential growth of theUnited Nations membership from 51 in 1945 to 191today. We all know that the obstacle to moving beyondthis point is the diverging and strongly held viewsabout whether an expanded membership should includenew permanent members. Again this is an issue thatmy Government would wish to see resolved byconsensus.Perhaps this matter might be put into betterperspective if we were to reflect on the role andfunction of the United Nations as a whole. Within thebroad range of human endeavours entrusted to theOrganization  the Charter gives the Security Councilone specific  albeit critical  mandate — that is  themaintenance of international peace and security. MyGovernment is of the view that it was not intended forthis collective security mandate to be carried out by theSecurity Council functioning as an independent andseparate entity  but rather to be carried out incooperation with the United Nations as a whole  andcertainly in tandem with the General Assembly  whereall Member States of this Organization have a voiceand a vote. After all  global peace and security concernall citizens of the world  not just the citizens of those21countries who happen at any given time to hold seatson the Security Council.For the present  war and conflict loom large  andthis must be of concern to the Council. But we musthold out hope that we  the Member States of thisOrganization  can make its constituent parts — theGeneral Assembly  the Economic and Social Council the development system and other organs and agencies and particularly the Security Council — work togetherto substantially reduce  if not eliminate  war  conflictand crises.We must also ask ourselves  what is the nature ofthe membership that the Council requires to implementits mandate? Far more than any consideration  it is thecommitment — and I underscore the word“commitment” — of the Council’s membership permanent or non-permanent  to enforcing itsdecisions — all of them — to responding to situationsthat threaten international peace and security whereverthey may arise and to combating the insidious spreadof international terrorism that determines the successof the Council’s work.We can no longer posture and bicker while thepeople of the world wait  particularly the people of thedeveloping world  who so desperately need the UnitedNations. We must take the historic opportunity that thissixtieth anniversary presents to set our sights on atwenty-first century world framed in the idealsenshrined in the Charter  a world of prosperity  peaceand security  with a strong United Nations at its core.We need the United Nations. It has the unmitigatedsupport of the Government and people of Saint Lucia."
"97",4130,"LIE",60,2005,"One weekago  the world summit sent a message of hope forpeace  development and human rights for all  and tooka number of steps towards institutional reform at theUnited Nations. The summit meeting has achievedmuch. It has also left a lot undone and has not met ourexpectations in several areas. We agree with theGeneral Assembly President’s assessment that only thework we do over the next few months will allow us afinal assessment of the value of the outcome document.The summit certainly did not achieve thecomprehensive breakthrough we had hoped for. Wetherefore look forward to working under thePresident’s guidance on the follow-up andimplementation and welcome the fact that he hasstarted this process immediately. Institutional changemust be the focus of our attention over the next fewmonths  both through the creation of new bodies andthe adaptation of existing ones. We will give particularattention to the Human Rights Council  the SecurityCouncil  the General Assembly and the Secretariat.We shared the general relief at the last-minuteagreement on the outcome document  since a lack ofsuch agreement would have been disastrous. We hadcreated expectations that were much higher than whatwe could have possibly achieved  at a time when theUnited Nations seemed more in need of reform thanever before. The reputation and the worldwide imageof the United Nations is clearly not what it used tobe — the oil-for-food scandal  cases of sexualexploitation by United Nations peacekeepers  inactionin the face of mass crimes and humanitarian criseshave overshadowed the many success stories that thisOrganization has to tell.15It is important to move on from the oil-for-foodscandal. Moving on  however  must not mean that weignore  yet again  the fact that the massive abuse andmismanagement revealed in the Volcker reports are butone expression of what is a systemic problem. Toomuch went wrong in the oil-for-food programme  andeverybody involved failed in their responsibilities inone way or another  including the Security Council. Nobureaucracy can be changed overnight  as we all knowfrom our national experience; but it is clear that only amore accountable Secretariat  one that works withoutundue pressure from us  the Member States  can restorethe confidence of the peoples it is meant to serve.Accountability must also be a key principle forthe intergovernmental bodies and thus guide us in ourwork on the relevant reforms. We are concerned at theincreasingly skewed institutional balance within theOrganization. The Security Council has clearly takenon a role that goes far beyond the central place it wasgiven under the Charter. Indeed  its activities areincreasingly venturing into the domains reserved forthe General Assembly  in particular.This entails a twofold risk. On the one hand many countries increasingly feel a lack of ownership ofthe Organization  although collective ownership basedon the principle of sovereign equality is one of thecornerstones of the Organization. On the other hand the Security Council is at risk of being paralysed by thesheer amount of issues on its agenda. The answer tothis challenge is clear: we need a stronger GeneralAssembly that asserts its central role and carries out itsfunctions effectively. In parallel  the Security Councilmust become more transparent and accountable inorder to truly carry out its functions on behalf of theentire membership.The lack of a solution to the complex issue ofSecurity Council reform is a disappointment to many.Enlargement and a more representative Council areclear necessities  and we will do our part to achieve anearly solution  with the strongest possible politicalsupport. In addition  and not less importantly  we mustalso improve the working methods of the SecurityCouncil  as stated in the World Summit Outcome(resolution 60/1). Transparency  accountability andstronger involvement of States that are not members ofthe Council are of decisive importance to enable it totruly act on behalf of the membership  as mandated bythe Charter. We will work hard for early and concreteresults  since effective changes in the daily workings ofthe Council would benefit the entire membership.We routinely repeat our annual call for a strongerGeneral Assembly. Small steps are taken every year and all of them are important. It appears to us however  that the most essential efforts to revitalize theGeneral Assembly do not come from measurescontained in General Assembly resolutions. Rather Member States must ensure that the Assembly is seizedwith truly relevant topics that are treated efficientlyand effectively. We may deplore the migration of topicsto the Security Council that we think should be dealtwith instead by the General Assembly. This trend however  will continue unabated unless the Assemblyproves to be a central decision-making body that takesits responsibilities seriously. The Assembly is what we as Member States  want it to be. A genuine andsustained effort is  therefore  required from all of us.We continue to fully support the earlyestablishment of a Human Rights Council to replacethe Commission on Human Rights. Like others  wewere disappointed at the meagre substance on thistopic that found its way into the outcome document.The Organization needs a standing body thateffectively promotes human rights worldwide  swiftlyresponds to gross and systematic violations of humanrights and reflects the importance of human rights forthis Organization. Close cooperation with astrengthened Office of the High Commissioner forHuman Rights will be essential. The Council must notduplicate the work carried out by other bodies  inparticular the General Assembly. It must  therefore  notbe a remake of the Commission on Human Rights witha new label. We look forward to working with thepresidency towards an early solution that would addconcrete value for the protection and promotion ofhuman rights.Mr. Loizaga (Paraguay)  Vice-President  took theChair.We consider the recognition of the “responsibilityto protect” as one of the most positive elements in theoutcome document. The main obligation for itsimplementation naturally falls to the Security Council.The Council has to ensure that disgraceful inaction such as in the case of the genocide in Rwanda  cannotever occur again. When the lives of innocent civiliansare at stake  such a responsibility must not becompromised by political considerations. Collective16action to prevent and respond to genocide  crimesagainst humanity and war crimes must  therefore  notbe made impossible by a veto or threat of veto by oneof the permanent members of the Council. We hopethat the Council will stand up to the challenge raisedby the summit. The membership as a whole clearly hasa shared obligation in this respect.Our achievement in the Summit Outcome on the“responsibility to protect” stands in stark contrast toour silence on the importance of fighting impunity forthe worst crimes of international concern. Moreprogress has been made in this area in the past fewyears than in almost any other area of internationalrelations. Transitional justice is now an inevitableelement of any serious effort to help societies in post-conflict situations. There is now a close and well-established relationship between the InternationalCriminal Court and the United Nations  in particularafter the Security Council decision to mandate theCourt to investigate the crimes in Darfur. We trust thatefforts to fight impunity will remain a high priority forthe Organization  recognizing the central role of theInternational Criminal Court in that respect.While it may be premature to pronounce a finaljudgement on the value of the outcome document  onething can be said with certainty: that document is areflection of what is agreeable five years after theMillennium Summit. It is remarkable how unevenprogress has been in several areas. Major advances such as the decision to fill an institutional void bycreating a Peacebuilding Commission  areaccompanied by major failures  such as the absence ofany agreement in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation. We have no choice but to build on thepositive elements of the Summit Outcome and to findearly solutions to institutional questions  in particular.Progress in those areas should help us to intensify ourwork and eventually to find agreement on unresolvedquestions in vital areas such as disarmament and non-proliferation. In this way  we can make the summit aturning point in the history of the United Nations.Two years ago  the Secretary-General said thatwe had reached a fork in the road; that observation wasrepeated many times during the process leading up tothe summit. So where are we today? Looking back atwhat we have achieved  it seems that we have taken theadvice of Yogi Berra  one of the great legends of theCity of New York  who said: “When you come to afork in the road  take it!”"
"98",4177,"LKA",60,2005,"I extend to you  Sir our warmest congratulations as you assume the highoffice of the President of the General Assembly at itssixtieth session. We wish you all the best and assureyou of Sri Lankaís support and cooperation in yourwork. I convey gratitude to Mr. Jean Ping for his astuteleadership of the fifty-ninth session.This sixtieth landmark session of the GeneralAssembly is doubly significant for Sri Lanka  as thisyear we mark the fiftieth anniversary of ourmembership in the United Nations. As a small nationthat has kept the flame of democracy burning throughmany tribulations  we take modest pride in the fact thatwhat we said at the first session of the GeneralAssembly we addressed can still be recalled withundiminished relevance. Prime Minister Bandaranaike representing Sri Lanka  said on that occasion:""This is an Organization which expresses itselfmost effectively by bringing to bear a certainmoral force - the collective moral force anddecency of human beings. That is a task in whichthe weak as well as the strong can render a usefulservice  and I give the Assembly the assurance on behalf of my country  that as far as we areconcerned  every endeavour that we can make inall sincerity to assist in the achievements of thosenoble ideals for which this Organization standswill always be forthcoming in the fullestmeasure."" (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Eleventh Session  Plenary Meetings 590th meeting  para. 42)Five decades on  I have the pleasure to say thatmy country has kept that promise by regularlycontributing to consensus-building in the Organizationin areas ranging from the law of the sea todisarmament and from human rights to the issue ofterrorism. We remain fully committed to the UnitedNations.We continue to believe that the collective moralforce of this Organization is indispensable for a secure peaceful and humane world. We are convinced thatsuch a world can be realized through the honestcommitment of every Member State to its individual2and collective responsibilities. Our peoples live in thehope and expectation that we shall deliver.On the morning of 26 December 2004  Sri Lankaand several other countries around the Indian Oceanregion woke up to a natural disaster of unprecedentedmagnitude. Towering tsunami waves struck two thirdsof the coastal areas of our island nation  leaving in itswake death and destruction on a scale hithertounknown by the world. Moved by the enormous scaleof that calamity  Governments  the United Nations andother international organizations  civil societyorganizations and countless well-wishers across theworld rushed to help my country and its people torecover  rehabilitate and rebuild. It was a magnificentgesture of human solidarity. Citizens of the worldreached out beyond the confines of geopolitical andother man-made barriers in one magnificent gesture ofhuman generosity. That rekindled in us new confidencein the power of peoples acting in unison across theworld to move Governments to act in the best interestsof humankind for a new and better world.On behalf of my people and my Government  Iwish to convey my profound appreciation and gratitudeto all those who assisted and sympathized with us andcontributed generously to rebuild our country. Let metake this opportunity to extend a special word of thanksto President Clinton  the United Nations Special Envoyfor Tsunami Recovery  for his commitment andleadership in coordinating the ongoing internationaleffort for sustainable recovery.Just as my country was in national distress in theaftermath of the tsunami disaster  we are now indistress in the face of an ominous renewal of terror onour soil. One month ago  my dear colleague LakshmanKadirgamar  the Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka  wasassassinated by a calculated and barbaric act ofterrorism. One more hero who fought relentlessly forfreedom and justice has been felled by the enemies ofpeace and unity. As Foreign Minister  the lateMr. Kadirgamar argued powerfully and workedtirelessly against extremist racist ideologies thatemploy violence to gain their divisive objectives. Hewas bold enough to expose to the world the true face ofterrorism inflicted upon my country. For 11 long years from this very podium  Mr. Kadirgamar warned theAssembly about the threat posed by terrorism to thedemocratic way of life  not only in Sri Lanka butacross the world.For over two decades  Sri Lanka has been undersustained assault by the Liberation Tigers of TamilEelam (LTTE)  an armed group that employs brutalmethods and suicide bombings in its campaign of terrorto obtain a separate State. Disregarding theimplementation of the ceasefire agreement  that groupcontinues to engage in numerous illegal and terroristactivities. Those include the conscription of children assoldiers - in callous disregard for promises given tomany  including the Special Representative of theSecretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict -and the assassination of democratic opponents  as partof their policy of eliminating Tamil political leadersand human rights activists  with disdain for allinternational law and practice and despite sustainedefforts by my Government and Norwegian facilitators.I tend to doubt that the Security Councilís recentidentification of that group in connection with childconscription would suffice to deter such activities.Targeted sanctions such as those proposed bySecretary-General Kofi Annan in his report to theSecurity Council should be imposed on those armedgroups that undermine national and international peaceand violate human rights.I firmly believe that terrorism cannot beeliminated through military suppression by Statemachinery. The socio-economic and cultural roots of aconflict must be sought and effectively redressed. Werecognize that a lasting solution to ethnic issues and toterrorism in my country  or anywhere else  can only befound through negotiation and dialogue. Accordingly my Government was the first  in 1994  to offer anegotiated settlement in place of an armed conflict  aswell as an extensive devolution of power instead of aseparate State. In February 2002  the Governmententered into a ceasefire agreement with the rebel groupand began talks  with the facilitation of theGovernment of Norway.However  two and a half years ago  the LTTEwalked away from the peace talks for the sixth time in18 years. All efforts to have the talks renewed have sofar failed. As a measure of good will after the tsunamidisaster struck us  I agreed to an arrangement with therebels for joint action in tsunami reconstruction work.That was yet another measure in a long series of effortsto engage and work with the rebels  particularly inhumanitarian ventures  despite their obdurateinsistence to remain armed and remain uncontested byany other democratic Tamil political party.3My Government has reaffirmed its commitmentto the ceasefire and the peace talks. We continue to doall that is required by a democratic Government toensure that we do not return to armed conflict fulfilling the wishes of all our people.A peace process cannot  and does not  operate ina vacuum. People demand that a process of peaceshould include the commitment and good conduct ofall parties to a conflict. When a belligerent group - anon-State actor - exploits the unique position offeredto it by a peace process to utilize the freedomguaranteed under a democratic system of governance tostrengthen itself through infiltration and the coercionof civilians  organizations and political parties  thatimpinges seriously on the ability of an electedGovernment to move forward effectively in its effortsat reconciliation and peace.The restoration of democracy  the creation ofspace for dissent and the promotion of human rights inthe affected areas in the north and the east of ourcountry are now essential prerequisites for a successfuland meaningful peace process in Sri Lanka. A lastingpolitical solution can come to fruition only when therebel group becomes a democratic civilianorganization. That deserves the fullest support of theinternational community.As we have been for many long years  Sri Lankaremains firmly committed to the global endeavour tofight terrorism in all its aspects. No cause justifies theindiscriminate unleashing of terror upon the innocent.Sri Lanka has accordingly signed and ratified allUnited Nations conventions aimed at combatingterrorism. We earnestly hope that at this session it willbe possible to conclude work on the comprehensiveconvention on international terrorism  in order tocomplete and strengthen the international legalframework to combat terrorism through collectivemeasures. Sri Lanka will continue to provide itscontribution to facilitate a consensus in its capacity asChair of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on thissubject.Sri Lanka has pledged to meet the United NationsMillennium Development Goals by the year 2015. Wehave already achieved the targeted goals in primaryeducation and in infant and maternal mortality. We arecommitted to further promoting the political andeconomic empowerment of women so that genderequality becomes a matter of human rights and socialjustice.Our National Child Protection Authorityimplements many programmes to eliminate abuse andviolence against children and to ensure their protectionas well as their right to freely enjoy life's mostprecious gift  childhood. Our success is due to theoutcome of sustained efforts in policy planning andimplementation.Those benchmarks and other indicatorsmanifesting the high physical quality of life enjoyed byour people will be further elevated as we strive to meetthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. However poverty remains a major challenge for us. To eradicatethis scourge  we are now taking further steps throughthe adoption of economic and social programmes  incooperation with our bilateral and multilateraldevelopment partners.If we look at the current world health situation although smallpox has been eradicated and polio is onthe verge of being eliminated  there are otherdiseases ó often associated with poverty - thatcontinue to take a heavy human toll  especially indeveloping countries. Every year  6 million childrendie from malnutrition before their fifth birthday. Morethan 50 per cent of people in Africa suffer from water-related diseases such as cholera. HIV/AIDS kills 6 000people every day. Each year  more than 300 millionpeople are infected with malaria. New challenges  suchas severe acute respiratory syndrome and avianinfluenza  indicate that national borders offer littleprotection against such proliferating pandemics. In theface of unparalleled advances  both in technology andin human mobility  it is unconscionable to let some inour nations suffer from diseases that can be controlled if not eliminated.In my view  there are three evils plaguing ourworld today that can have no place in the modernglobalizing era of the twenty-first century: poverty disease and terrorism. Today  these evils affect thesocial  cultural and economic well-being of a majorityof humankind. No country can deal with them on itsown. International cooperation is in our self-interestand needs to be mustered. We share the strong beliefthat the United Nations  on the occasion of its sixtiethanniversary  should seriously undertake comprehensivereforms so that the Organization is fully equipped to4meet new challenges  taking into account the currentglobal realities.We acknowledge with appreciation the valuablecontribution made by the Secretary-General and histeam to the ongoing reform process  which madepossible the adoption of the outcome document(resolution 60/1) at the recent summit of theOrganization. We urge all Member States to worktogether to build on that framework in order tooperationalize what has been agreed and to workfurther on what remains to be achieved.Recovery after the tsunami disaster taught us thevalue and potential of humanity acting in unison whenfellow human beings are in distress. We now hope thatthe same human spirit and common interests willcontinue to prevail in addressing the socio-economicand security challenges we face. Let us resolve tocommit ourselves collectively  on this solemn occasionof the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization  to acttogether in the interest of humankind in order that wemay strive to eliminate the three scourges of poverty disease and terrorism."
"99",4219,"LSO",60,2005,"My delegation associatesitself with the compliments extended to you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of this session and toyour predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping ofGabon.The United Nations was born 60 years ago whenthe brutality of war impressed itself on all as far12beyond human comprehension and tolerance. TheOrganization became a source of hope  founded as itwas on the inalienable  interlinked and mutuallyinterdependent pillars of development  human rightsand security.Member States of this Organization haveincreasingly yearned for its reform in order to make itmore democratic and responsive to the needs of allnations  rich and poor  big and small  strong and weak.We should recall that the last reform of the UnitedNations was in 1963  a good four decades ago. Againstthis background  my delegation pays tribute to theSecretary-General for his report entitled “In largerfreedom: towards development  security and humanrights for all” (A/59/2005). That report formed thebasis for discussions by Member States as theyprepared for the five-year review of the MillenniumDeclaration and for this sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly. It raises critical issues regarding the reformof this world body to enable it to meet the challengesand threats of the twenty-first century — a dauntingtask indeed.However  we have noted with regret that someMember States have relegated to the back burnercritical issues of development  giving priority insteadto security issues  particularly the reform of theSecurity Council. As a result of this trend  we foreseean emerging  untenable and  indeed  unwarrantedsituation with the potential to divide regions and/orcontinents and to adversely affect cordial relationsbetween States.In order to move in unison  the internationalcommunity should strive to advance the globaldevelopment  human rights and security agendassimultaneously. All agree that the HIV and AIDSpandemic has emerged as a major threat todevelopment  reversing  as it does  all the gains thathave been made so far. We all also agree that theravages of extreme poverty continue to haunt us.Needless to say  extreme poverty constitutes a violationof human dignity. Armed conflicts also hamperdevelopment. Africa presents a classical example ofhow those menaces compromise not only peace andsecurity  but also development  thus militating againstrespect for human rights.Indeed  it is no coincidence that development hasbeen one of the key objectives of most  if not all  majorUnited Nations conferences and summits in theeconomic  social and related fields. Hence  mydelegation welcomes the efforts of those donorcountries that have achieved the 0.7 per cent target ofgross national income as official developmentassistance (ODA)  with 0.2 per cent of gross nationalincome for the least developed countries. We alsowelcome initiatives by some countries to set uptimetables for fulfilling their ODA targets. However we reiterate our appeal that developed countries abideby their commitments to help developing countries inall the relevant areas. They have to accelerate andincrease the flows of ODA and foreign directinvestment. They also have to adopt appropriatemeasures to fully integrate small and vulnerableeconomies into the multilateral trading system  canceldebt  transfer technology  render financial andtechnical assistance and provide capacity-buildingprogrammes for developing countries.On this auspicious occasion  my delegationexpresses sincere appreciation for all initiativesrecently taken to address the needs of developingcountries  especially the debt cancellation extended bythe G-8 countries to highly indebted poor countries.However  we appeal for debt cancellation for all leastdeveloped countries in order to enable them to redirecttheir meagre resources to national developmentprogrammes. It is an irrefutable fact that a substantialpercentage of the national budgets of least developedcountries that do not fall within the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative category isconsumed by servicing their debts.Lesotho supports the launching of a series of“quick wins”  as recommended by the Secretary-General in his report  as this would go a long waytowards broadening commitment to the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and promoting economicgrowth in many developing countries. In our view  thecriteria for the selection of countries for theimplementation of the “quick wins” should be fair andtransparent.Terrorism  proliferation of weapons of massdestruction to non-State actors  the existence of nuclearweapons  and armed conflict top the list of globalsecurity issues. There is  therefore  an urgent need toconclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism.My delegation hopes that the General Assembly willsoon initiate negotiations on an internationalinstrument to prevent the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction to non-State actors. We regret the fact13that the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) was not able to reach consensus. However  wewish to emphasize the need for all States parties toadhere to the three pillars of the Treaty — namely disarmament  non-proliferation and peaceful uses ofnuclear energy. We also wish to encourage the nuclear-weapon States that have not yet ratified or acceded tothe NPT and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty to become parties to those important treaties.The notorious use of small arms and lightweapons in armed conflicts is well documented.Lesotho therefore regrets the inability on the part of theOpen-ended Working Group on small arms to adopt alegally binding document. We also attach greatimportance to the issue of prevention of internal armedconflicts by the international community. While wesupport the moral obligation behind the proposed newconcept of the “responsibility to protect”  we suggestthat the issue should be subjected to furtherconsideration by Member States  guided by thefundamental principles enshrined in the United NationsCharter. Needless to say  the sanctity of Article 51 ofthe Charter should be preserved.The Kingdom of Lesotho considers it theresponsibility of the international community  with theUnited Nations playing the central role  to put in placeeffective measures aimed at preventing genocide ethnic cleansing and the atrocities perpetrated onwomen and children caught up in armed conflict.Consequently  my delegation considers the enhancedrole of the major organs of the United Nations particularly the General Assembly  to be of paramountimportance. One of the major constraints of the UnitedNations is that it lacks a mechanism designed to avoidState collapse and the slide into war  or to assistcountries in their transition from war to peace. It iswithin this context that Lesotho supports the proposedestablishment of a Peacebuilding Commission.In the area of human rights  we support theelevation of the Commission on Human Rights to aHuman Rights Council  a body that would be apoliticaland insist on the protection both of civil and politicalrights and of economic  social and cultural rights. Formy delegation  the flaws of the Commission lay mostlyin its focus and not necessarily in its size.It is in this twenty-first century that peace security  the right to self-determination  respect for allhuman rights and fundamental freedoms must beguaranteed as the norm rather than the exception.Hence  our call for the right to self-determination ofthe Palestinian people and complete withdrawal fromtheir occupied territories  the independence of theSaharawi people  the lifting of the unilateral economicembargo against the people of Cuba and the end toarmed conflicts  particularly in Africa. These mattersmust be addressed and resolved urgently comprehensively and honestly  without fear or favour and without malice to anybody."
"100",4245,"LTU",60,2005,"Lithuania welcomes thiseffort — the most extensive and ambitious ever made —to renew the United Nations. We must ensure that thesummit commitments we all have undertaken areimplemented and that they produce real and tangibleresults  in order to improve the Organization’s capacityto act adequately  effectively  expeditiously and in thebest interests of us all. Their implementation shouldalso enable us to give hope to the vulnerable and thedestitute and to make the world a better place for all.We welcome the affirmation by the outcomedocument of the inextricable link betweendevelopment  security and human rights. That  in ourview  is a sine qua non for all our future actions. Wewelcome the reaffirmation of the commitments regardingthe implementation of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. As a member State of the European Union  weare proud of the Union’s commitment to double itsoverall aid level by the year 2010  including aconsiderable increase in aid to Africa.We support the establishment of a DemocracyFund for countries seeking to establish or strengthentheir democratic practices. In our view  that Fund willcontribute to maximizing the impact of developmentassistance by focusing on the improvement ofgovernance standards. Transparent and democraticgovernance practices can make quite a difference in theperformance of countries that are otherwise quitesimilar in terms of their natural resources and socialstructure.We emphasize the role of international trade inpromoting economic growth and development and thusin fighting poverty. We therefore add our voice to callsfor a rapid  ambitious and development-orientedcompletion of the Doha trade round.Furthermore  Lithuania is convinced that alldevelopment and all relevant related strategies shouldhave a built-in element of environmental sustainability.We welcome the language of the outcome document tothat effect but believe that we should go further.In particular  we underline the importance ofgoing beyond Kyoto by initiating negotiations on thedevelopment of a more inclusive and equitableinternational framework for climate change beyond theyear 2012.Lithuania welcomes the strong and unconditionalcondemnation of terrorism in the outcome document.36We call on the General Assembly to complete  at itssixtieth session  work on a comprehensive conventionon terrorism and on a global counter-terrorism strategy as proposed by the Secretary-General earlier this year.We strongly welcome the endorsement of“responsibility to protect” populations from genocide war crimes and ethnic cleansing. This is offundamental importance; it is an important step thatgives us hope that we shall no longer look away norstand idly by as entire populations are being killed.Lithuania fully supports the proposals regardingUnited Nations management reform. We hope theblueprint to be submitted by the Secretary-General willnot fall victim to endless debates by Member Statesbut  rather  lead to tangible changes  improving theOrganization’s accountability  transparency  efficiencyand professionalism  while assuring the highest ethicalstandards.Too often in the past  we have seen nationsemerging from conflict lapse into disruption and chaos thus destabilizing entire regions. We therefore call forrapid progress in making the PeacebuildingCommission fully operational before the end of thisyear.While expressing our satisfaction with theagreement to double resources for the Office of theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights  we urge allnations to take conclusive decisions in the comingmonths on the basis of the wording agreed to by thevast majority of countries in establishing a robust andeffective Human Rights Council.At the same time  we have to admit that theoutcome document is lacking considerably in someareas. We are well aware that the reform process is nota one-time event. As we proceed along the path ofUnited Nations reform  we must make sure these areasare not left out.First  there is the issue of impunity. The fightagainst impunity and the rendering of justice must bepart and parcel of our common efforts to improve thehuman rights situation worldwide. We stress oursupport for the International Criminal Court  as well asthe existing ad hoc and mixed criminal tribunals andother mechanisms for international justice.Secondly  there is the question of SecurityCouncil reform which cannot be delayed further especially if we really care about restoring theauthority and credibility of the United Nations. TheCouncil’s working methods must be improved toprovide greater input from non-member States. Itsmembership must be expanded in both the permanentand non-permanent categories  with due considerationbeing paid to equitable geographical representation andthe recent emergence of new international actors andcontributors. Lithuania has long supported thecandidacies of Germany and Japan as permanentmembers of the Security Council. We appreciate theaspirations of India and Brazil to undertake thehonourable responsibility of permanent membership and we agree that Africa’s representation in bothcategories of membership is long overdue.After 11 years of debate on the issue of SecurityCouncil reform  it is time to admit that we are unlikelyto produce new arguments without repeating ourselvesindefinitely. Lithuania  therefore  calls on all MemberStates to assume their responsibilities and to takeaction.Finally  let me touch upon the failure to agree  inthe outcome document  on the issues of non-proliferation and disarmament. This is the major failureof our summit  especially in the light of the unfortunateconclusion of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation TreatyReview Conference earlier this year. We must honourour earlier agreements and obligations  restoreconsensus and invest all our efforts in search ofagreement on this crucial issue. We therefore call on allnations to rally around the initiative put forward byNorway and a group of like-minded countries; webelieve this initiative could become a basis of viableconsensus and future cooperative action.Last December  we witnessed an unprecedentedoutburst of solidarity with the Asian tsunami victims.These past few weeks  our hearts were with the peopleof the United States  whose citizens saw their livesshattered and whole communities destroyed byHurricane Katrina. We offered whatever assistance wecould to those affected and we extend our condolencesto all those who have suffered from this enormousdevastation.In moments of grief and sorrow  we are one. Painhas no nationality  no religion  no race. Similarly  weshould all be one in our solidarity. We should not haveto wait for new cataclysms and large-scale tragedies inorder to agree on the need to build a renewed UnitedNations for the new century. As Secretary-General37Kofi Annan has repeatedly noted  in this globalized interrelated world  it is the collective interest that isoften in our best national interest."
"101",4289,"LUX",60,2005,"Just a few daysago  in this same Hall  the follow-up High-levelMeeting was held on the Millennium  bringing togetheran unprecedented number of high political leaders fromall over the world. After a process of discussion andnegotiation  both lengthy and thorough  we adoptedwhat should serve as our road map for the period tocome. The final document should not only inspire butalso give specific direction to  the actions of theinternational community in the United Nations.While not all our expectations or ambitions wererealized in that document and considerable gaps cryout to be filled — I am thinking particularly of thecrucial areas of disarmament and non-proliferation —we must  nevertheless  welcome the fact that aroundthe central pillars of the United Nations  namely development  peace and human rights  broad agreementhas crystallized and a new international agenda has infact emerged.It is particularly appropriate and propitious thatthe current regular session of the General Assemblyhas opened immediately following on the importantHigh-level Meeting. While we may feel that thefoundation was laid during that important event  what14we have to do now is to complete what has beenundertaken  consolidate the sections of walls that havebeen erected and build those parts that have only beensketched out — and here I am thinking particularly ofthe Human Rights Council — and provide our projectwith a sound roof.Renewal of multilateralism in the context of thespecial conditions at the beginning of this century andthe reform of the United Nations must be conductedwith determination  driven by a real sense of urgencyin the light of the significance of the task that awaits usand the crucial matters at stake for billions of men andwomen.Knowing as I do  Sir  your personal commitment your dynamism and your numerous qualities  I amconvinced that you will direct the work of the sixtiethregular session of the General Assembly in such a wayso as to ensure that we can  all together  carry out theurgent mandate entrusted to us by the High-levelMeeting and  more particularly  by our peoples  whohave placed their hopes on a revamped andstrengthened United Nations system. It is in this spiritthat my country is prepared to subscribe withconviction to the accountability pact proposed by ourSecretary-General  whom I would  once again  like tocongratulate for what he has been doing at the head ofour Organization.I would note with satisfaction your intention  Sir to present a detailed and operational workplan in orderto organize our work as effectively as possible so thatwe can complete the tasks awaiting us according to afixed timetable. We have to provide concrete evidencethat our Assembly will not go back to business as usualonce the spotlights have been switched off.For all those — and I am one of them — whobelieve that our Assembly  a veritable parliament of thenations of the world  has a paramount role to play inthe emergence of a strong political consensus at theworld level  the quick adoption of specific operationaldecisions should deal a sound rebuff to all thoseCassandras  all those cynics and all those who upholdthe status quo that opposes change.In his opening statement at the sixtieth regularsession of the General Assembly  our Secretary-General clearly defined the mission that awaits us inthe coming months. Among the subjects that claim ourattention  I would focus on the following: humanrights  in order to strengthen the impact of thisessential dimension in all the activities of the UnitedNations  particularly through the immediate creation ofa Human Rights Council on the basis of the positivegroundwork laid in the preparatory work of the High-level Meeting; the establishment of the PeacebuildingCommission  an innovative body; the reform of themain bodies of our Organization  including the urgentneed to enlarge the Security Council in both categoriesof membership in order to make the Council morerepresentative of the realities at the beginning of thetwenty-first century and to make it more transparentand more effective; giving concrete form to the idea of“the responsibility to protect”  whose confirmation inthe final document is one of the main breakthroughs ofthe recent High-level Meeting; and finally  the reformof the administrative and financial management of theUnited Nations in order to consolidate the effectivenessand integrity of the Organization.Let me also devote a few minutes to the questionof development. Development remains the mainpolitical and moral issue of our time. It must be notedthat progress towards the Millennium DevelopmentGoals has been uneven and some backward movementmust be acknowledged  particularly in sub-SaharanAfrica. The recently published Human DevelopmentReport notes that“In the midst of an increasingly prosperousglobal economy  10.7 million children every yeardo not live to see their fifth birthday  and morethan 1 billion people survive in abject poverty onless than $1 per day. The HIV/AIDS pandemichas inflicted the single greatest reversal in humandevelopment. In 2003  the pandemic claimed 3million lives and left another five million peopleinfected.” (Human Development Report 2005  p. 1)In view of these alarming facts  setting up andcreating a genuine partnership for development  basedon the groundwork of the Monterrey Conference andon the basis of shared responsibility borne by both thedonor countries and the recipient countries  remains amatter of priority. The countries of the South must taketheir own development in hand by defining detailednational strategies that are effective and directedtowards good governance and combating corruption.The countries of the North must fulfil theircommitments in matters of trade  debt reduction andenhancing the quality of aid and good practices.Particular emphasis should be laid on increasing15financial flows for development. In this connection when Luxembourg occupied the presidency of theEuropean Union during the first half of this year  themember States of the European Union took the historicdecision to commit themselves on a precise timetableto make a considerable increase of their officialdevelopment aid (ODA) in order to achieve the targetof 0.7 per cent of their gross national products by 2015at the latest. Four of the five countries  including myown  that have achieved or gone beyond 0.7 percent — a target reconfirmed by the High-levelMeeting — are member States of the European Union.The Government of Luxembourg has confirmed itsintention to increase its ODA contribution in the yearsto come to one per cent of its gross national income.Unfortunately  too often the fruits of developmentare erased by natural or man-made disasters. In theSudan  in the Great Lakes region and elsewhere  thistruth is demonstrated daily. There can be nodevelopment without security. There can be no securitywithout development.That is why I particularly welcome the agreementreached during the summit on the establishment of aPeacebuilding Commission. That should make itpossible for us to contemplate the tremendousproblems of transition confronting the countriesemerging from conflict from an overall viewpoint bringing together the dimensions of crisis management humanitarian aid  reconstruction of State structures andlocal and legal structures and providing essentialpublic goods and services  while at the same time re-launching the process of economic and socialdevelopment.On the basis of the mandate given by the summit Luxembourg actively supports the reform of theCentral Emergency Revolving Fund  which should takeshape in coming months so that this renovated Fundcan become fully operational by the beginning of 2006.My country has already announced  just a few days agohere in New York  that it would be making acontribution of $4 million to the capital of this Fund and other States have also confirmed largecontributions.If development is  according to the well-knownformula  the new name of peace  we cannot fail nevertheless  to note that numerous internationalconflicts and intra-State conflicts and hotbeds oftension continue to dot the face of the world.Peace and stability in the Middle East continue tobe at the forefront of our concerns.The current President of the Council of theEuropean Union  my friend Jack Straw  recalled twodays ago from this rostrum the spirit in which thenegotiations on the nuclear issue were conducted withIran in recent months. Cooperation and respect forinternational norms and treaties  rather thandiscrimination or a desire to create dependency  werewhat motivated us in this case. In the Paris AgreementIran subscribed to a total suspension of all activitiesconnected with enrichment and all reprocessingactivities. It is that commitment that made it possibleto develop political and economic cooperation with theEuropean Union. It is that commitment — which  Ihardly need to recall  has been ratified by theInternational Atomic Energy Agency — that I todaycall upon Iran to respect.In this context  I should also like to welcome theagreement that was reached just today with theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to abandon allnuclear programmes and to rejoin the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This is excellent news.On 22 June 2005  more than 80 countries andorganizations met in Brussels at the InternationalConference on Iraq  sponsored jointly by the EuropeanUnion and the United States  with the presence of ourSecretary-General  and expressed their support for theIraqi Transitional Government and its political economic and security priorities. That importantConference made it possible  in particular  for theStates members of the European Union to reaffirmtheir unanimous and united support for a secure  stable unified  prosperous  democratic Iraq  respectful ofhuman rights  which will benefit fully from theexercise of its sovereignty  cooperate constructivelywith its neighbours and with the internationalcommunity  and end violence in that country. And it isour Organization that  more than ever  must be adriving force  play a leading role  in that context.The Near East has only rarely been the scene ofpositive developments. This is why I should likeparticularly and expressly to welcome the politicalcourage of the leaders of the two sides regarding thesuccessful withdrawal from Gaza and certain parts ofthe north of the West Bank. Now we should takeadvantage of that positive dynamic to launch a genuinepeace prospect based on the road map  which continues16to be the essential framework in this matter. Theconditions to promote the emergence of a climate ofpeace were recalled by the European Council on 16 and17 June 2005. In particular  the fact that the PalestinianAuthority is taking control of Gaza now provides itwith an opportunity to demonstrate its institutional andadministrative maturity  particularly as regardsmaintaining law and order and combating terrorism.The cessation of all acts of violence by the parties isalso an essential requirement.Regarding the crucial question of Israelicolonization activities in the occupied territories  theEuropean Council noted that “the policy ofcolonization is an obstacle to peace and threatensmaking virtually impossible any solution based on thecoexistence of two States”. In the same context  theEuropean Council expressed concern at thecontinuation of the building of the separation barrier inthe occupied Palestinian territory  including EastJerusalem and its surrounding areas  which contradictsthe pertinent provisions of international law. At thesame time  of course  the Council recognized the rightof Israel to protect its citizens against attacks.Let us assume that the next meeting of theQuartet  which will be held in New York tomorrow will find political formulas that will make it possible tocontinue the positive dynamic of disengagement fromGaza and will clear the way for a just and lasting peacein this divided part of our world.As very often happens  patches of clouds andglimmers of hope are mingled when we analyse theinternational situation  but one thing remains constant and that is the central role of the United Nations in thesearch for international peace and security. Sixty yearsafter the signing of the San Francisco Charter  we haveall met together here to confirm our contract ofconfidence with this Organization  the United Nations which is our common heritage — a United Nationsrenovated and reformed  synchronized with the threatsand challenges of our times and able to respond to theexpectations of the peoples of the world. As asignatory to the Charter in 1945  Luxembourg  as far asit is concerned  is ready to renew this pledge ofconfidence with enthusiasm  confidence anddetermination."
"102",4315,"LVA",60,2005,"Today  I would like tobegin by congratulating the founding nations and allthose present here today as we celebrate the sixtiethanniversary of the United Nations  which can be proudof so many great accomplishments.Since its foundation in 1945  the United Nationshas helped to negotiate an end to over 170 regionalconflicts and has deployed more than 35 peacekeepingmissions. It is leading international efforts to clear landmines from former zones of warfare. It has providedaid to tens of millions of refugees fleeing war  famineand persecution. It has focused the world’s attention onissues of human rights. It provides annualdisbursements that amount to $10 billion per year forvarious development programmes. It has made safedrinking water available to 1.3 billion people duringthe last decade. It has helped to eradicate smallpoxfrom the globe  with polio set to follow soon. It hashelped to reduce world child mortality rates by halfsince 1960. It has improved education in thedeveloping countries  where 60 per cent of adults cannow read and write. It provides over 2 million tons offood to victims of emergencies every year. About 30million people in 36 different countries benefited fromsuch assistance in 2004 alone. And it has hosted avariety of significant events  such as the RioConference on Environment and Development  whichresulted in important treaties on biodiversity andclimate change.The vast majority of the United Nationsemployees over the years have been guided by aprofound sense of duty. I would like to single out thoseresponsible and dedicated workers who providehumanitarian assistance in the poorest regions of theglobe  in zones of conflict  and in places that have beenaffected by natural disasters. We should pay tribute toall those who have lost their lives in the service ofhumanity  like the lamented Sergio Vieiro de Mello 36who was killed while leading the United Nations workin Iraq.The world needs the United Nations. It needs theUnited Nations today as much as it did 60 years ago.We need a United Nations that is more and moreefficient in dealing with global challenges and able toact efficiently to prevent such horrors as the genocidein Rwanda  the ethnic cleansing in the Balkans  and theongoing human tragedy in the Darfur region of theSudan. While such values and principles as nationalsovereignty  non-intervention and self-determinationlie at the very core of relations between the UnitedNations Member States  we also have to recognize ourcollective responsibility to protect innocent civiliansfrom wide-scale abuse and suffering. It is our duty toarrive at a common understanding of that responsibilityto protect so that the international community can actefficiently to avert future mass killings and crimesagainst humanity. I encourage those United NationsMember States that have not yet done so to ratify theRome Statute of the International Criminal Court andto support the Court’s endeavours to bring warcriminals to justice.When the United Nations was created  mycountry  Latvia  was an occupied country and had nosay in the rules that govern the Organization. It wastherefore a particular honour that the President ofLatvia was chosen as a Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for promoting reforms within the UnitedNations during the past six months. I am delighted that in some aspects  we have succeeded in reaching abroad consensus  as for instance on the necessity ofcreating a peacebuilding commission. However  westill do not have a common understanding regardingmany other reforms that need to be carried out. It is ourshared responsibility to arrive at such an understandingsoon.As we work to strengthen the United Nations  weshould ensure better cooperation and practices andavoid duplication of effort. Latvia strongly supports thedecision to establish a Human Rights Council  whichrecognizes human rights as a priority on the UnitedNations agenda. I therefore encourage delegations towork with vigour to ensure the smooth transformationof the Human Rights Commission into a council and toset the highest standards for its future members. A vitalrole in the realization of those standards will be playedby the High Commissioner for Human Rights. I wish toconfirm Latvia’s support for the Commissioner and herOffice  and welcome the decision to allocate a largershare of the United Nations regular budget to thatimportant aspect of its work.My country fully supports the managementreforms of the United Nations administration that havebeen put forth by the Secretary-General. The reformswould afford the Secretary-General greater authoritywithin certain fields of the United Nations activities  aswell as greater responsibilities. The reforms would alsocontribute to the transparency and professionalism ofthe Secretariat  which has been justly criticized forserious deficiencies in its work. I am pleased that theUnited Nations leadership is willing to propose viablechanges for improving the operations of theSecretariat. It is now up to the Member States to arriveat a consensus upon those proposed measures.Latvia has consistently endorsed reform of theSecurity Council in order to render it more effectiveand representative. We believe that the SecurityCouncil should be enlarged to incorporate newpermanent seats without veto rights. We also believethat the permanent members of the Security Councilshould refrain from using the veto in cases of genocide war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes againsthumanity. That promises to be one of the most difficultissues to resolve  but we should nevertheless notabandon our efforts to reach a feasible accord by theend of this year.The Secretary-General has highlighted thelinkage between security and development. Thecommitments he outlines are designed to advance therealization of the Millennium Development Goals which  if achieved by 2015  would mark a genuine turnof the tide in our common struggle against poverty anddisease. The comprehensive package agreed at the G-8Gleneagles summit in July is an important milestone inhelping Africa to eradicate extreme poverty  combatAIDS and malaria  and ensure that every child receivesa primary education. We must now make sure that whatwas agreed at Gleneagles  including a doubling of aidby 2010 and the writing off of billions of dollars indebt  will be delivered.I would also like to highlight the necessity ofachieving gender equality  which includes universalaccess to reproductive health information and servicesby 2015. That was the central goal of the agreementsthat were reached at the International Conference onPopulation and Development in Cairo in 1994. Our37countries must strengthen girls’ access to both primaryand secondary education so that they become lesssubject to early forced marriages and economicexploitation. Girls must be made safe from genitalmutilation. Girls and women must be guaranteedsexual and reproductive rights and protection againstHIV/AIDS and other diseases. There is no excuse forhalf a million women dying each year of pregnancy-related causes that are entirely preventable.The need for continued development concernsalmost all regions in the world  including EasternEurope  which has experienced momentous changessince the fall of the iron curtain in the late 1980s andearly 1990s. Thirteen years ago  the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) established anoffice in Latvia to facilitate the country’s developmentand improve people’s lives. Its mandate in Latvia willconclude at the end of this year  and I take thisopportunity to express Latvia’s gratitude for theinvaluable assistance that UNDP has provided to mycountry over these 13 years.Today  Latvia  as a full State member of theEuropean Union  has become a net contributor of aidfor achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Weknow that  without the promotion of good governanceat all levels  sound macroeconomic policies and aconcerted fight against corruption  the Goals will notbe reached. Latvia stands ready to share its experienceof transition to democratic rule and a free marketeconomy  as it has done and will continue to do withcountries in transition in Eastern Europe and theCaucasus. We welcome the initiative of establishing ademocracy fund to assist all committed countries intheir efforts to consolidate democratic politicalsystems.Recognizing the opportunities that derive fromthe use of modern technologies in the field ofinformation and communications  Latvia has beenactively involved in the preparations for the WorldSummit on the Information Society  which will be heldin Tunis this November. We hope that the Summit willprovide unprecedented opportunities for strengtheningcooperation among Governments  civil society and theprivate sector in promoting the use of information andcommunication technologies and generating knowledgesocieties.A major step forward is our unequivocalcondemnation of terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations. My own country  Latvia  regained itsfreedom through peaceful and non-violent means. Wetriumphed due to our firm belief in historical justice along with a great deal of persistence  patience andhope.Latvia welcomes the Secretary-General’s counter-terrorism strategy. We need to arrive at acomprehensive convention on international terrorism which would provide a legal framework forinternational cooperation in combating that modern-day scourge of humanity. The war against terrorismwill be won only if it is fought while respecting basichuman rights and remembering humanistic ethics.I express my profound disappointment that wecould not achieve any consensus on disarmament andthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.Progress in that area is more urgently needed than ever.I therefore encourage every United Nations MemberState to act responsibly and in good faith in the pursuitof those goals.Since the previous session of the GeneralAssembly a year ago  the world has experiencednatural disasters of an unprecedented scale ofdestruction. We have just had Hurricane Katrina  andare still getting over the terrible tsunami last year inSouth-East Asia. The hard lessons of those crises mustbe learned in order to prepare for future emergencies.While there is nothing we can do to preventearthquakes and tsunamis  scientists have warned usfor years that our continued dependence on andincreasing consumption of fossil fuels is generatinggreenhouse gas emissions that are causing disruptiveclimate changes. Unless we diversify our sources ofenergy  we can expect to see more devastatinghurricanes and floods in some parts of the world  alongwith drought and desertification in others.The challenges that our nations face areformidable  and we will be able to overcome them onlyby working together. As we prepare to implement thedecisions we have made at this gathering  I wish us allthe foresight and the courage to uphold the higherinterest of the common good over narrow  short-term local concerns. The future of our peoples depends onus."
"103",4362,"MAR",60,2005,"Ishould like to begin by congratulating Ambassador JanEliasson  on behalf of the delegation of Morocco  onhis election to the presidency of the General Assemblyat this historic session and by wishing him success inhis noble task. I should also like to express to hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping  ForeignMinister of the brotherly State of Gabon  our sincerethanks and profound appreciation for his efforts asPresident of the General Assembly during the fifty-ninth session and for the patience and dedication thathe showed in his excellent conduct of the preparatorywork for the High-level Plenary Meeting  therebyensuring the success of the summit  which marked thesixtieth anniversary of our Organization.I should also like to pay tribute to theSecretary-General  Kofi Annan  for his commendableefforts to improve the structure of the Organization andenhance its working methods and effectiveness.Last week’s summit meeting was a key event inthe history of the United Nations and marked a turningpoint in the Organization’s activities  not just becauseof the impressive number of very distinguishedparticipants  but also because of the importance of theoutcome document (resolution 60/1)  which wasadopted as a result of the contribution of all members.In this regard  the Kingdom of Morocco supportsthe proposals submitted by the Secretary-General witha view to ensuring follow-up of the outcomes of thevarious international conferences on developmentissues. Although it failed to meet our expectations  thesummit outcome document nevertheless reiterated ourinternational commitments; it paves the way forstrengthening the role and effectiveness of theOrganization and adapting it to meet the newchallenges posed by global developments.The Kingdom of Morocco would like to reaffirmits readiness to contribute to the implementation of therecommendations of the summit and to participate inthe international effort to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). My country hasundertaken a number of proactive national initiativesrelating to ensuring respect for human rights and theestablishment of an integrated and modern society inwhich women play an active role in development.Many of these are set out in the National Initiative forHuman Development  announced by His Majesty KingMohammed VI on 18 May. That initiative reflectsMorocco’s willingness to create a development modelbased on a successful association of modernity democratization and economic openness. That model isalso aimed at achieving a sustained improvement in ourhuman development index  within a spirit of collectiveparticipation  solidarity  equal opportunity  thedissemination of knowledge and the provision of basicsocial services.The end of the era of ideological division and therise of a new world order has called the attention of theinternational community to new challenges posed bythe scourges of terrorism  hunger  poverty backwardness  illiteracy and pandemic disease  as wellas the increasing number of refugees fleeing from thedisasters of war and destruction and the growingnumber of ethnic  tribal and religious conflicts andseparatist trends.Since the events of 11 September 2001  theinternational community has grown increasingly awareof the threat of terrorism and of the need to combat itby all available means and to address its root causesand underlying motives.The Kingdom of Morocco  which has itself beensubjected to the scourge of terrorism  has participated4in efforts to combat it through the elaboration of legalinstruments and practical arrangements at the national regional and international levels. During this session the Kingdom of Morocco will continue to contribute toefforts to adopt a comprehensive convention againstterrorism  thereby complementing its participation inthe elaboration of the International Convention for theSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.As for development challenges  our Africancontinent is the only region that will not be able toachieve the MDGs within the specified time frameunless the international community provides fullsupport. In this regard  African countries acknowledgethat they must rely  first and foremost  on their ownhuman and material resources. However  Africa’seconomic take-off can be achieved only through anefficient and realistic partnership involving all theparties concerned  including donor countries andinternational and regional organizations. Thatpartnership must be founded on an integrated andsustained process that benefits the existing North-South and South-South cooperation mechanisms.Convinced of the necessity to collectively combatthe ills that are besetting our African continent Morocco has always taken the lead in supporting andencouraging any initiative aimed at freeing the Africanpeoples from their stark predicament. Thus  on morethan one occasion  the Kingdom of Morocco hasvoiced full support for the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development as an integrated andcomprehensive action plan designed to solve thepersistent economic and social problems that haveplagued our continent since the era of independence.On the other hand  Morocco has always shown itsreadiness to contribute to conflict resolution in Africaby bringing together belligerent parties and bystrengthening the ties of brotherhood and goodneighbourliness among the States of western Africa  aswell as through the participation of the Royal ArmedForces of Morocco in peacekeeping operationsconducted under the auspices of the United Nations inAfrica.The Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the decisionby the Group of Eight to cancel the debt of leastdeveloped African countries. I would also like to recallthat His Majesty King Mohammed VI was among thefirst to initiate such a move. During the first EuropeanUnion-Africa Summit  which was held in Cairo  HisMajesty announced the cancellation of the debt of leastdeveloped African countries  opened Morocco’s marketto their products and granted them customsexemptions.The success of Africa’s economic take-offremains contingent upon the success of regionalintegration throughout the continent. The Kingdom ofMorocco therefore believes that the reactivation of theMaghreb Arab Union is a political imperative  aneconomic necessity and a historical reality thatresponds to the aspirations of the peoples of the regionand reflects the expectations of our partners  especiallythose in the Mediterranean region  with whom we arestriving to reinforce our partnership as we prepare tocelebrate the tenth anniversary of the Barcelonaprocess.For those reasons  Morocco is working toreactivate the Union’s machinery and to remove anyobstacles that might hinder its relaunching on a sound constructive and meaningful basis. In this context Morocco would like to reaffirm its steadfastcommitment to working closely with the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy and SpecialRepresentative  as well as with all parties concerned  inorder to break the current stalemate and reach anegotiated political solution to the artificial conflictwith respect to the Moroccan Sahara. Because of itsgeostrategic nature  that conflict between two brotherlyneighbouring countries  Morocco and Algeria  requiresthe involvement of our brethren in Algeria in a seriousand constructive dialogue with a view to putting an endto it once and for all.His Majesty King Mohammed VI  in his mostrecent Throne Day speech  affirmed Morocco’swillingness “to engage in serious negotiations with aview to reaching a final solution that would win UnitedNations support and grant the inhabitants of thesouthern provinces autonomy within the sovereignty ofthe Kingdom and its territorial and national integrity”.Pending the involvement of all parties in thatnegotiation process  it remains urgent to follow up onthe humanitarian aspect of the problem by disclosingthe fate of all Moroccan missing persons and prisoners.The International Committee of the Red Cross wasunable to establish contacts with those persons or todiscover their place of detention. In addition  theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees should be allowed to undertake a fair and5free census of Moroccan citizens being held in theTindouf camps in Algeria  who should be freed andallowed to exercise their right to return to theirhomeland.The Arab region  which continues to experiencerecurrent crises as well as new ones equally violent andfierce  looks to the Organization and to otherinternational and regional actors for their assistance insolving them. In that regard  we hope that the ray ofoptimism that shone recently in the Middle East prompting us to engage in cautious optimism  will besupported by serious and brave measures that willrevive the peace process and put it back on track. TheKingdom of Morocco welcomed the withdrawal fromthe Gaza Strip and considers it an important andpositive decision on the path towards fullimplementation of the road map.Morocco  which has always striven tirelessly andeffectively to keep open the channels ofcommunication and dialogue among the peoples of theMiddle East  reaffirms its active commitment topromoting a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeliconflict that will lead to the establishment of a final lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle Eastthrough the reactivation of the road map  theguaranteed establishment of a free Palestinian Statewith Al-Quds as its capital  and the withdrawal ofIsrael from the occupied Syrian and Lebaneseterritories.His Majesty King Mohammed VI  Chairman ofthe Al-Quds Committee  has reaffirmed his resolve tocontinue to actively pursue and support all peaceefforts and to work to preserve the Arab and Islamicidentity of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and its status as a placeof coexistence and tolerance among the three revealedreligions.With regard to the situation in the brotherly Stateof Iraq  the Kingdom of Morocco  althoughappreciating highly the continuous and intensiveefforts to re-establish stability  peace andreconstruction in Iraq  and although following therecent political progress with great interest  affirmsthat the participation of all constituents of Iraqi societyis needed to build the democratic institutions of thenew Iraqi State and to preserve its national unity.Moreover  the international community must help theIraqi people to overcome the ongoing crisis by creatingthe conditions necessary for peace and stability.Reforming the United Nations to enable it to meetthe challenges of the twenty-first century  restructuringits organs and bodies and updating their mandates willrequire not only that its working methods be improved but also that the Organization regain its natural andleading role as a framework for constructive dialogueand as a forum for creative interaction among thevarious intellectual currents and religious and culturaltrends.In that context  Morocco commends theSecretary-General for his decision to appoint a High-level Group for the Alliance of Civilizations and toestablish a new cultural world order based on toleranceand coexistence. We support diversity and unity ofvisions and goals as contributions to meeting thechallenges of the new millennium."
"104",4386,"MCO",60,2005,"In 1945 in the aftermath of a war that tore apart all the peoplesof the world - a war during which the most basichuman rights were violated - a few leading countriescame together at the San Francisco Conference  here inthe United States of America  and created the UnitedNations. Collective security had to be restored  humanrights had to be reinstated and our world needed tomove towards greater justice and freedom.Much has been achieved over the past 60 years.Today  our Organization consists of 191 MemberStates. We hope - and many heads of State orGovernment expressed this wish during the recentsummit - that we are beginning a new phase in thequest for collective security and respect for humanrights and in the fight against poverty and disease which continue to affect so many peoples.To that end  the international community must bebetter represented  particularly in the Security Council.Further progress must also be made through theestablishment of the Human Rights Council  theachievement of the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs) to combat poverty and the more efficientmanagement of the Organization.Once again  on behalf of His Serene HighnessPrince Albert II  I wish to pay tribute to the Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session andto you  Sir  on your election to the presidency at thesixtieth session. I hope that  throughout our debates atthis session  the momentum for change will continue tobuild. I would also like to pay tribute to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who has pursuedthose noble objectives with tenacity and farsightedness.The Principality of Monaco fully endorses theoutcome document  and will support itsimplementation so that we can  together  achieve newprogress in the coming months.The Government of the Principality of Monacohas  over the past few years  reoriented its internationalcooperation policy in order to contribute moreeffectively to the achievement of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Thus  the main focus of Monacoíscooperation policies are those defined in theframework of the Millennium Development Goals: thepreservation of the environment in the broad sense ofthe term; the fight against poverty; and support foreducation and health care.Monaco's official development assistance (ODA)has continued to increase  multiplying fivefold in thepast 10 years - an effort that will continue in the yearsto come with a view to reaching the 0.7 per cent targetas soon as possible. Likewise  we endorse theDeclaration on innovative sources of financing fordevelopment.Through its voluntary contributions to the UnitedNations and several other institutions and agencies 34including the United Nations Educational  Scientificand Cultural Organization  the World HealthOrganization  the Joint United Nations Programme onHIV/AIDS  UNICEF  the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) and the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees  to name buta few  the Principality sponsors activities aimed atassisting developing countries and the mostunderprivileged populations.Over one third of our cooperation funding isprovided within the framework of multilateralassistance  and the increase over the past few yearshas  of course  also benefited bilateral assistance.The General Assembly proclaimed 2005 as theInternational Year of Microcredit in an effort topromote such programmes globally. The Principalityhas  for many years  accorded special attention tomicrocredit  as part of our financing for developmentprogramme  in particular through its cooperation withUNDP. In this regard  funds provided by Monacoprovide support for small businesses in Africa that areoperating under conditions of extreme poverty  with aview to improving the standard of living of the mostvulnerable people  particularly women.Our cooperation efforts are directed mostlytowards the countries of the Mediterranean region andthe least developed countries in Africa  especiallythose of sub-Saharan Africa  because we also believethat we need to open up spaces for regional solidaritythroughout the world.The Mediterranean is an ecoregion with whichthe Principality has  historically  been closely involved.The implementation of cooperation plans to protect theMediterranean environment  both coastal and marine is therefore a priority.Monaco also provides assistance to a number ofFrench-speaking countries in areas relating largely topoverty eradication  health care and education.Working in complementarity with the Government Monacoís non-governmental organizations are alsocommitted in those countries. I would like tounderscore that the Principality is ready to participate to the best of its abilities and within its financialmeans  in initiatives in the areas of health care andtraining.During his recent address from this rostrum Prince Albert II expressed great sadness in connectionwith the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina inthe United States.Almost one year ago  South-East Asia suffered anunprecedented natural disaster. The solidarity shown inthe aftermath of that tragedy and the effectiveness ofthe response to it  on the part of not only humanitarianworkers but also civil society  make it clear that theresources and the capacity do exist to allow for sharedresponsibility for the future welfare of the peoples towhom the Charter is dedicated. The Principality ofMonaco has mobilized` its efforts by undertaking agreat many private and public activities in this respect.The Principality of Monaco has always been astaunch defender of humanitarian law. We support inprinciple and on the basis of our convictions any actionaimed at alleviating difficult situations resulting fromnatural or manmade disasters.The Principality of Monaco is a small State thatenjoys a certain level of wealth. It cannot change theworld on its own  but it intends to set an example in thefield of cooperation.The creation of the Human Rights Council andthe establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission willmark a turning point in the history of the Organization.Even more importantly  they represent a response todevelopments in multilateral relations.In keeping with the document just adopted  theGeneral Assembly will also have to strengthen theOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights;establish the rule of law assistance unit within theSecretariat; and work constructively to ensure that theemerging concept of responsibility to protect becomespositive law as soon as possible.In this regard  I would insist on the imperativeneed to put an end to impunity for crimes committedagainst children.The defence of the rights and interests of childrenhas always been one of our major concerns. Indeed any act of violence against a child is a violation of thelofty principles for which the United Nations stands. Inorder to build ""a world fit for children""  in compliancewith the measures adopted during the special session ofthe General Assembly on children  held in May 2002 the Government of the Principality is deeply dedicatedto promoting the concept that there should be no statuteof limitations for the most serious violations of therights of children  and that we should expand the35powers of national jurisdictions by providing themwith universal competence in that area.Prince Albert II  during his address to the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session  invited theinternational community to give thought to a plan toaddress the impunity that continues to prevail withregard to the most heinous crimes committed againstchildren.In that context  the Principality has stressed thepromotion of that concept in the resolution on theRights of the Child  adopted last year by the GeneralAssembly  and it has reaffirmed its position during thesession of the Human Rights Commission held lastApril in Geneva. It is the wish of the Principality topursue its undertaking with the support of theinternational community on those crucial matters.In other respects  the Monegasque Governmenthas paid close attention and contributed financially tothe global study on violence against children led byProfessor Pinheiro  which will present its conclusionsin October 2006. Likewise  the Principality activelyparticipated  along with the European Council  in thetriennial programme of action - for the period 2005-2007 - entitled ""Childhood and violence""  whoseconclusions  like that of the global study on violenceagainst children  will enable us to make specificrecommendations to States. The Principality ofMonaco will always support all international initiativesaimed at enhancing the protection of children.Respect for the environment is also one of ourconcerns. Mr. President  it was in your country Sweden  just over three decades ago that environmentallaw was born. The Stockholm Conference saw theemergence of a discipline that met a need: to addressthe protection of natural resources and of ourenvironment in an organized manner.Furthermore  we have decided to join the KyotoProtocol  and we hope  in the tradition of theOceanographic Institute ó created 100 years ago byPrince Albert I of Monaco ó to make our contributionto studies on the future of our planet.However  the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme is no longer the ideal forum to coordinateaction and ensure its effectiveness because of theextremely rapid expansion of this field and given themany conventions  protocols and agreements that havebeen adopted. That is why we support the idea ofcreating a United Nations environmental body.Globalization must not make us forget that wecome from different regions and cultures that shouldenrich one another and not be a source of clashes or ofconflicts.We believe in interaction between the UnitedNations and regional organizations; one sets thegeneral rules  and the others facilitate theirimplementation at the local level.The reforms just adopted at the High-levelPlenary Meeting strengthen the unique position of theGeneral Assembly as the guarantor of the systemíscoherence.I can assure the Assembly that Monaco willcontinue resolutely to make its contribution  howevermodest  to building a better world  with full respect forour differences."
"105",4411,"MDA",60,2005,"At theoutset  I should like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the sixtieth session of theGeneral Assembly. My delegation is confident thatyour knowledge and vast professional experience willensure strong and competent leadership of theAssembly.Let me also pay well-deserved tribute to yourpredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  whose tireless effortsguided Member States through the difficultnegotiations that resulted in the adoption of theoutcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting.A few days ago  speaking from this rostrum President Vladimir Voronin of the Republic ofMoldova reaffirmed my country’s unwavering supportfor the United Nations and its commitment to worktogether with other Member States to renew andstrengthen the United Nations system. We need aneffective United Nations  a richly diverse organizationthat is united in its resolve and able to address thechallenges and threats confronting the contemporaryworld.The 2005 World Summit Outcome provides a fairassessment of the threats and challenges facing us inthe areas of peace  security  development and humanrights and rightly emphasizes their interconnectednature. World leaders agreed on a number of concreteactions and steps that need to be undertaken in all thoseareas. Those measures might not meet everyone’sexpectations  but they reflect a degree of consensusthat is both challenging and inspiring.Since one of the world summit’s aims was toassess implementation of the Millennium Declaration it is heartening to see the strong and unambiguouscommitment of donor and developing countries toachieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.The measures outlined in the areas of financingfor development  debt cancellation  trade promotion investment and other specific areas of developmentneed to be fully implemented. Developed anddeveloping countries must build their declared globalpartnership for development on the basis of mutualtrust and respect  while the effectiveness and quality ofaid can be ensured through a balance of appropriatefinancing  good governance and sound policies.In the area of peace and security  the Republic ofMoldova welcomes the unequivocal condemnation ofterrorism and supports the call to conclude and agreeon  during the current session of the General Assembly a comprehensive convention on international terrorismcontaining a legal definition of terrorism. During the2005 summit  the Republic of Moldova signed theInternational Convention for the Suppression of Actsof Nuclear Terrorism  which is further proof of ourongoing commitment to multilateral efforts aimed at28strengthening the United Nations counter-terrorismlegal framework.My country welcomes the decision to create aPeacebuilding Commission  which it considers to beone of the main achievements of the summit. Asenvisioned  that body has the potential to bring much-needed coherence to our strategies for post-conflictpeacebuilding and recovery  provided that we succeedin making it operational by the end of this year.Unfortunately  the outcome document pays farless attention to conflict prevention and conflictresolution  especially with regard to internal conflicts.Many regional organizations have been entrusted under the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter with dealing with a number of conflicts that are at thecentre of the Security Council’s attention. But  as thereport of the High-level Panel on Threats  Challengesand Change (A/59/565) rightly pointed out  the effortsof regional organizations do not absolve the UnitedNations of its primary responsibilities for peace andsecurity. The United Nations needs to reach out moresystematically to those regional organizations  andsteps should be taken to increase their accountability particularly in the case of protracted or frozenconflicts  where a situation does not improve or evenworsens over the years.We would also like to recall the High-levelPanel’s proposals aimed at enhancing the capabilitiesand the role of the United Nations in conflictmediation  which were set aside in the discussions.One of those proposals was to give the Department ofPolitical Affairs additional resources and to restructureit in order to provide more consistent and professionalmediation support. No conflict in the world should beleft without the attention of the United Nations regardless of whether it is on the Security Council’sagenda or not.Like many Member States  we regret the failureto reach agreement on a section on non-proliferationand disarmament in the summit outcome document.But that must not preclude further common efforts tobuild consensus around the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the pursuit of nucleardisarmament.We appreciate the outcome document’s supportfor the implementation of the Programme of Action toPrevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade inSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Butto make a real difference  Member States shouldexpedite and conclude negotiations on legally bindingagreements on the marking and tracing of small armsand light weapons  as well as their brokering andtransfer.The Republic of Moldova fully endorses thecommitment to create a Human Rights Council. Welook forward to speedy and productive negotiations onthe Council’s mandate  size  membership and workingprocedures. We have high expectations of that standingbody’s ability to protect and even enforce respect forfundamental human rights  especially in cases ofhumanitarian crimes and violations in conflict zonesoutside the control of sovereign States. My countryalso supports the decision to strengthen the Office ofthe High Commissioner for Human Rights and its fieldoffices.As a country that has placed the concepts ofdemocracy and rule of law at its core since gainingindependence  the Republic of Moldova welcomes thereaffirmation of democracy as a universal value in theoutcome document and the creation of the newDemocracy Fund.The success of United Nations reform depends onthe ability of Member States to implement measuresthat revitalize the General Assembly and enhance theeffectiveness of the Economic and Social Council andthe Secretariat. Although the issue of the enlargementof the Security Council proved to be highly divisive  anenormous amount of work has been done to exploredifferent options. We all agree that the expandedCouncil should be representative  efficient andtransparent. We should continue to seek consensusbased on those principles.The triangle of development  peace and freedomis of direct relevance to the Republic of Moldova. Ouryoung democracy is struggling with the difficulties oftransition and suffers — as it has for more than 13years — from a protracted  unsolved conflict inspiredand supported from abroad. It sees the fundamentalfreedoms of a significant number of its citizensviolated by an aggressive separatist regime.As representatives of my country have stressed inthe Assembly over the years  settling the internalconflict in the Transnistrian region of the Republic ofMoldova is our greatest priority. Separatism is not onlythe main threat to our country’s peace and security; itis also the main obstacle to the further consolidation of29the independence and the statehood of the Republic ofMoldova and a hindrance to its economic development.The reintegration of the country  with respect for theprinciple of territorial integrity and sovereignty  is aprerequisite for a stable and prosperous Republic ofMoldova able to achieve its internal and externalstrategic objectives.The Republic of Moldova has worked faithfullyand constructively towards that end for many years looking for a peaceful  just and lasting solution topolitical conflict and fostering dialogue with the self-appointed Transnistrian leaders  with the help ofmediating countries and the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Unfortunately  allefforts have been in vain and have only demonstratedthe ineffectiveness of the old format. With support andencouragement from abroad  the separatist leaders havebeen using the negotiation process to claim legitimacyfor themselves as the representatives of the will of theinhabitants of the Transnistrian region of the Republicof Moldova  and have promoted the idea of a pseudo-State  for which there are no ethnic  religious or otherplausible grounds. In the meantime  the region hasbecome a centre of illegal and criminal economicactivity  trafficking  arms production and proliferationand a threat to the stability and security of that part ofthe European continent. The region’s multinationalpopulation lives under constant pressure from theseparatist regime’s propaganda and under thesurveillance of its security structures. The people of theregion are constantly being intimidated and harassed.That situation cannot go on indefinitely. There isa growing sense of urgency in Moldovan society expressed in the unprecedented consensus and theresolve of all political parties with respect to the waysand means of settling the conflict. Political momentumis growing  as Ukraine has advanced a new plan for asettlement. Following that development  the Parliamentof the Republic of Moldova passed several laws relatedto the Ukrainian plan  including the law onfundamental regulations of the special legal status ofsettlements on the left bank of the Nistru River —Transnistria — of 22 July  2005.The Republic of Moldova has been calling for anumber of concrete actions to create the conditions fora lasting solution to the conflict  including thefollowing elements.First  our Government has called for thecomplete  unconditional and transparent withdrawal offoreign troops and munitions from the territory ofMoldova  in accordance with the relevant decisions ofthe OSCE Istanbul Summit. The foreign militarypresence is used as external pressure and provides apolitical shield for the separatist authorities.Secondly  it has called for the establishment oftransparent and effective control over the Transnistriansegment of the Moldovan-Ukrainian border. We highlyappreciate the decision of the European Union to assistin monitoring that border segment  which should helpcurb illegal commercial activities and all trafficking. Inthat context  we support the early signing of thememorandum of understanding on the EuropeanCommission Border Assistance Mission to theRepublic of Moldova and Ukraine  and we express oursatisfaction at the readiness of the Ukrainianauthorities to cooperate in that respect.Thirdly  the Government has called for thedemocratization and demilitarization of theTransnistrian region of the Republic of Moldovathrough the development of civil society  politicalparties and a free press  as well as through respect forhuman rights and freedoms  the disarmament anddismantlement of illegal military units  militias andsecurity structures. Only after creating a vibrant andpolitically open society — a process that should becarried out under the close monitoring of theinternational community — can one envisage thepossibility of free and democratic elections inTransnistria to establish genuine  responsiblerepresentatives of the population of the region.The Republic of Moldova has been pleading for anew negotiating format by connecting the EuropeanUnion and the United States. New inputs  ideas andpractical contributions are needed to move the processforward. The same is true of the current peacekeepingmechanism  which is far from meeting the recognizedstandards of an unbiased attitude and should bereplaced by an international mechanism of military andcivil observers under an OSCE mandate.The reintegration of the country would give newimpetus to our efforts for sustained economicdevelopment. The country’s strong economicperformance  reflected in its stable and sustainedeconomic growth over the past four years  as well asthe quality of our country’s poverty reduction and30economic growth strategy paper and the Government’ssteady commitment to fully implementing it demonstrate that the Republic of Moldova is on theright track to increasing the well-being of our citizensand improving the country’s socio-economicindicators  including through achievement of theMillennium Development Goals.The Republic of Moldova has irreversibly chosenthe path of European integration as the strategicobjective of its foreign policy. We are aware of the fullextent of changes  reforms and improvements we haveto achieve internally to meet the rigorous Europeanstandards for economic development  goodgovernance  democracy  political freedom and humanrights. Our optimism with respect to Moldova’ssuccessful achievement of its aspirations is rooted inthe firm will of the entire society to mobilize ourresources to achieve that objective.Successful and complete implementation of theEU-Moldova Action Plan will give us the opportunityto rise to a new level of contractual relations with theEuropean Union  as set out in that document. It willalso be decisive for achieving further internal reformsand general progress in the country. The recent firstevaluation of the implementation of the EU-MoldovaAction Plan showed encouraging results and steadyprogress. The Government is committed to the fullimplementation of that comprehensive document which will open  we hope  a clear Europeanperspective for our country.My country is ready to work tirelessly to makeour Organization stronger  more efficient and able tofulfil the ambitious goals set by our leaders at the 2005world summit. Only through collective action carriedout in a spirit of global partnership will we be able tocreate a better  more secure world for the generationsto come."
"106",4455,"MDG",60,2005,"Noone here took part in the first General Assembly in1945. We can only imagine how at the end of theSecond World War men and women full of hope wereprompted by a firm resolve to change and make theworld better. They were right. The shortcomings andweaknesses of our Organization should not in any waydetract from the leading role of the United Nations inthe world.Do we today share the same spirit that inspiredour predecessors? At the end of this General Assemblywill we feel that we have improved the world?We welcome the draft outcome document. Wealso welcome recent resolutions adopted by the4Security Council on counter-terrorism and conflictprevention  particularly in Africa. We support the earlyestablishment of a human rights council so as topromote democracy.However  the results of the summit meeting donot fully correspond with Africa’s aspirations. What islacking is that long-hoped-for impetus that wouldenable every Member State to express its views  givehope to our peoples  preserve the balance of nature andenable us to ensure the futures of all the world’schildren. We need to further strengthen our efforts bytrying fresh approaches.First of all  it is high time to strengthen the roleof the General Assembly. It is also time for Africa tobe better represented within United Nations bodies and in particular on the Security Council. That is amatter of justice  but it is also a necessity for thedevelopment of our continent. Having Africa’s voiceheard on the international level and allowing it to sharein responsibilities on a global level are marks ofconcern and respect for our States and our peoples. Letus put an end to the exclusion of the African continent.We want to make our full and complete contribution todebates and decision-making on issues that concernhow our world works.The discussions in recent months have focused oninstitutional reform at the United Nations. That is avery important question. It is also important for Africa.But we would ask you to expand the discussion so as toproperly define the role that the Organization shouldplay in world development. The United Nations shouldbe more than just a crisis management body — a bodythat addresses poverty  disasters and emergencies. Letus convert it into a body that inspires us with hope. Letus work together for development  justice and equity.The sixtieth anniversary of the United Nationsshould mark the beginning of a new era in which wewill have the opportunity to build a more prosperous more just  more democratic and more environmentallyaware world — a world that is sounder  healthier  moreresponsible and more united.We need to work out strategies and plans thatarouse enthusiasm among nations and attract thefervent hopes of our peoples. We will only change theworld if we can secure the support of our populations.The United Nations must devise and adopt thenecessary measures to establish a more balanced world.All the crises  the wars  the questions of security andterrorism  the world’s epidemics — all of those haveconcrete causes.The Secretary-General rightly quoted one of theUnited Nations purposes from the preamble to theCharter: “to promote social progress and betterstandards of life in larger freedom”. Our peoples wantto have real opportunities. Quite rightly  they call forthe favourable conditions that will allow them to takeadvantage of those opportunities.Our Organization is 60 years old. Much has beenachieved in decolonization and peacekeeping  forinstance. Five years ago we defined the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Now we must go still further. Letus devise a genuine global strategy for development  astrategic partnership with a clear-cut vision and moreambitious goals.As regards Africa  what is lacking is a clearvision of its future. It can be seen that Africa is still apoor continent. Nonetheless  Africa has the potential tobe rich. The previous General Assembly provided mewith an opportunity to propose a “Marshall Plan forAfrica”. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdommade the same proposal and the President of the WorldBank  Mr. Paul Wolfowitz  has also spoken of a plan ofaction for Africa. Let us ask other donors to join in thisinitiative.The Marshall Plan for Africa should cover muchmore than a call to cancel debt and increase financialsupport. It should take into account Africa’s potentialand the right steps that are needed to realize it. Itshould build a positive image of our continent anddetermine the role that it could play in economic political  social and cultural spheres.Globalization highlights the economic dimensionof international relations. However  we need to investmore in the social dimension of development byenhancing the role of the Economic and Social Councilso as to meet the legitimate aspirations of our peoples.The future of Africa lies  of course  with itschildren. The plan for Africa should describe how wecan approve the transfer of knowledge and how we canensure access for young Africans to the world’sknowledge and expertise  so that the intellectualpotential of millions of people will not be wasted.We need to increase literacy levels. We also needan educational system that meets international5standards of quality and effectiveness — a system thatwill foster creativity and help our peoples to realizetheir dreams; a system that will optimize our countries’human resources so as to enable us to play animportant role in the world economy; a system whichwill help to close the digital divide among nations.Saving African children also means feeding them.In that respect  overcoming hunger in Africa is anurgent challenge  as millions of people will be affectedby this crisis.Madagascar  as a new member of the SouthernAfrican Development Community  urges the GeneralAssembly to make that crisis its highest priority. Wemust act rapidly and with resolve.Let us also improve the situation of women. Theydeserve to play a more significant role in civil societyand in the economic and political arena.I have personally been asked by the Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project to share theirconcerns with you. Indeed  one of the mostburdensome daily chores of African women isproviding a family with water. Access to drinkingwater for all frees women from servitude and thuspreserves their dignity. Moreover  the issue of watermanagement is inseparable from those of sanitationand hygiene. Water is a source of life and a greateconomic asset. The development of hydroelectricenergy is one solution to Africa’s energy deficit. Let usnot forget that rational water management will enableus to achieve food self-sufficiency.Such a Marshall Plan should include theprotection and development of natural resources  whichare crucial to our continent. To that end  we have avision  which we call “Madagascar  naturally”.Two years ago in Durban  I announced ourdecision to triple the extent of protected areas in thecountry so as to ensure the preservation of our rich andunique biodiversity. We took the decision to earmark 8per cent of funds stemming from the cancellation ofexternal debt for the funding of our protected-areasystem.The African continent already is involved in thepreservation of natural resources for the world and willincrease its efforts in that area.Let us focus on agribusiness by creating moreopportunities for processing our natural products andthus enhancing the value-added that they bring to ourcountries. This is the approach that Madagascar istaking now  with the support of donors. Let us fosterinitiatives to establish a fair and equitable tradingregime among nations  such as the reduction of tradebarriers.In short  such a Marshall Plan should make itclear that the African continent can prosper byshouldering its responsibilities. We need to speak moreof our assets than of our weaknesses. We need to speakof our potential rather than our lack of resources. Theworld wants to invest in our potential. Let us find afresh approach. Let us create a new image  a new  clearvision for Africa. It is only through such a vision along with a genuine global strategy for development that the Millennium Development Goals can beachieved.Such an approach must incorporate the variousinternational and bilateral programmes and projectswhose differing structures  objectives and contentmake them complicated to manage and hinder theidentification of possible synergies. But it is incumbenton us to ensure the effective coordination ofdevelopment and thus adopt the concept of countryownership. We in Madagascar have taken the initiativeof setting up national programmes in which all donors’projects are incorporated.The world must heed the needs of Africa  butAfrica must also face up to its responsibilities bystrengthening democracy  good governance and therule of law.The discussions on the role and the structure ofthe United Nations which have taken place in thecontext of the sixtieth anniversary offer us anexceptional opportunity. Let us create more equitablestructures that are better suited to today’s needs andrealities. Let us draw inspiration from the spirit of thefounding fathers of our Organization.Let us be nations united in spirit  with a globalvision and strategy of development for a world that isnot only more dynamic but also more balanced  moreequitable and more responsible. Let us work towardsthat end."
"107",4494,"MDV",60,2005,"Mr. President  onbehalf of my delegation  allow me to congratulateMr. Jan Eliasson on his election to preside over thissession of the General Assembly. I should like also totake this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessorfor the exemplary manner in which he guided the workof the fifty-ninth session of the Assembly.Allow me also to thank the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his inspiring report entitled “Inlarger freedom: towards development  security andhuman rights for all”.It was 40 years ago today that the Maldives wasadmitted to the membership of the United Nations. Weare very proud of that milestone. We were then thesmallest country to have joined the United Nations  afact which led to questions being asked in somequarters as to the viability of full membership for smallStates and their ability to assume it. We survived theso-called mini-State debate  thereby reinforcing theconcept of the sovereign equality of all States regardless of size. We also survived the cold warwithout losing the peace and stability that have been soessential to the social and economic progress of ourpeople.But today we are facing a much more challengingtask and much more serious questions about theeconomic viability of the country  whose economy hasbeen devastated by the Indian Ocean tsunami.Compared to other affected countries  the loss of lifeand property damage in the Maldives were small inabsolute numbers. But in proportionate terms  we arethe worst-affected country.Some 62 per cent of the gross domestic producthas been destroyed. More than 7 per cent of thepopulation is internally displaced. The social andeconomic infrastructure was damaged or destroyed inover one quarter of all inhabited islands  12 of whichare now nothing but rubble.Given the nationwide scale of destruction  timelyassistance from the international community wascrucial in dealing with the emergency reliefrequirements. We thank all nations  peoples andorganizations for their generosity.I would also like to extend a special vote ofappreciation and thanks to President Bill Clinton  theUnited Nations Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery for his commitment and leadership in coordinatinginternational efforts to assist affected countries withthe recovery. We are particularly grateful for hiscontinued engagement  given that nearly nine monthsafter the tsunami  the situation in the country has noteased.There are still major funding gaps in the nationaleconomic recovery programme. An economy whichhad grown at an average of 8 per cent per annumduring the past two decades is now forecast to contractby 3 per cent. Rising oil prices  unforeseen tsunami-related expenditures and tourism revenue shortfall arecreating significant financial pressures requiring  forthe first time in our history  budget support fromdonors.As a small country  the Maldives lays great storeon assistance from the international community for itssurvival. We hope that our appeals for assistance willresult in the extension of the support that is required totide us over the current blip in the economy.It is ironic that just six days before the tsunamistruck  the Assembly had voted to begin a transitionperiod for the Maldives for graduation from leastdeveloped country status. While we recognize theachievements of our people through their diligentefforts and the support of the donor community  it isvital that trade preferences and other concessions notbe phased out through graduation before the countryrecovers from the extensive destruction caused by thetsunami.The tsunami that struck the Indian Ocean was agrim reminder of the ferocity of the elements and thehelplessness of communities exposed to naturaldisasters. Just as we support the establishment of atsunami early warning system for the Indian Ocean our thoughts are also with the millions of people in theUnited States  India  China  Japan and elsewhere whorecently have faced extreme weather events whichbrought unprecedented death  destruction and pain. Ourhearts go out to those in New Orleans affected byHurricane Katrina.17One cannot overstate the importance of protectingthe environment and saving lives. There is no longer afrontline comprising only small low-lying islandStates. Indeed  climate change can cause destructionanytime and anywhere. Prevention is the only optionwhen there is no cure. We hope that the Kyoto Protocolwill be implemented with full effectiveness.Small States have the narrowest margins of safetyand the least ability to mitigate or overcomeenvironmental catastrophes. We would like to assertthe critical importance of the early and effectiveimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy for SmallIsland Developing States.Not only is the Maldives seeking to build backbetter after the tsunami but we are also going through ahistoric transformation of the governance structures ofthe country. The Agenda for Democracy and Reformbeing pursued by the Government focuses not only onmaking the Maldives a twenty-first century democracy but also on strengthening human rights protection.With the acceleration of the Government’s reformprogramme over the past two years  sweeping changeshave been brought to the political landscape of theMaldives. Political pluralism has been strengthened byintroducing  for the first time in the country’s history  amultiparty system. The country is also undertakingunprecedented legal and judicial reforms aimed at acomprehensive modernization of the criminal justicesystem in order to bring it into compliance withinternational norms and standards.A Constitutional Assembly is in session to drawup a modern democratic constitution to embed liberaldemocracy in the country and strengthen adherence tointernational standards in civil liberties and theprotection of human rights.Just last week  the Maldives signed on to theOptional Protocol to the Convention against Tortureand Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment orPunishment. We are already committed to fulltransparency and openness in safeguarding humanrights in the Maldives. We believe that the engagementof the international community is one of the strongestsafeguards in protecting human rights. We have alreadyacceded to a number of conventions on human rightsand we are confident that the measures currently underway in the national reform programme will enable usto fully comply with and become parties to theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rightsand the International Covenant on Economic  Socialand Cultural Rights.To recall Sir Winston Churchill  it would not beenough to say that we will do all that we can. Rather we would like to say that we will do all that isrequired  and then some  to ensure that our people livein larger freedom  as envisaged in the United NationsCharter.We are mindful that under Article 2  paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter Member States are notrequired to submit matters within their domesticjurisdiction for settlement in United Nations forums but the Maldives believes that its aspirations to build amodern and mature democracy are important enough tobe articulated before this Assembly. Moreover  givenour limited resources and dearth of technical expertise the support of the international community is vital forthe success of the ambitious democracy project beingpursued by the Government. We are indeed encouragedby the initiative to establish a Democracy Fund. Igratefully acknowledge the support being extended tous by the United Nations system and our bilateralpartners in this historic enterprise in the Maldives.Today  on the occasion of the fortieth anniversaryof the admission of the Maldives to the United Nations my President wrote to the Secretary-General thankinghim and the United Nations membership for theircollaboration and support over the past four decades onmatters of crucial national interest to the Maldives: werecall the support given by this Assembly to therequirements of protection and security of small States;we acknowledge the important role played by theUnited Nations membership in advancing efforts toprotect the global environment; and we are gratified bythe assistance that we are getting towards theattainment of the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs). Already we are on track for attaining most ofthe MDGs.We hope that the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1) will expeditethe march of countries towards attainment of theMDGs and towards conquering disease  despair anddeprivation.The July bombings in London and other incidentsof terrorism have shocked and horrified us. We hopethat measures agreed upon to combat internationalterrorism  strengthen peace and international security promote peacebuilding and strengthen the United18Nations machinery on human rights protection will befollowed up effectively.Sound multilateralism is crucial to our quest for abetter world in an age of globalization. It is thereforeimportant that the effectiveness of the United Nationsbe strengthened.We welcome the proposals made by theSecretary-General on all aspects of United Nationsreform. While we recognize the need forcomprehensive reforms  we hope that the reforms ofthe Security Council will be completed before theyear’s end in order to enable it to reflect more fully therealities of the twenty-first century. Our support of theGroup of Four proposal is based on thoseconsiderations and we hope that there will be widesupport for it.We have consistently expressed concern aboutconflict and tension in the Middle East. We areencouraged by the Israeli withdrawal from the GazaStrip. We hope that this will be a first step in themovement towards a just and lasting peace in theMiddle East.In conclusion  allow me to reiterate the firmcommitment of the Maldives to the principles andpurposes enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Wewill work with the other members of the internationalcommunity to uphold and promote those loftyobjectives.We seek a world  as envisioned 60 years ago inthe United Nations Charter  of all peoples living inlarger freedom  free from want  free from fear and withthe dignity that God almighty bestowed on all of us."
"108",4541,"MEX",60,2005,"During the past year  we  the Member States  embarkedupon a reform process without precedent in the historyof our Organization. The international communitybecame fully aware of the need to transform the UnitedNations in order better to meet the threats andchallenges of our time. Although significant progresswas made  we have not yet achieved the expectedgoals.The political and intellectual contributions putforth by the High-level Panel on Threats  Challengesand Change  the Secretary-Generalís Report ìIn largerfreedomî (A/59/2005)  the United Nations MillenniumProject report and the input provided by the Group ofFriends for the Reform of the United Nations are among others  important efforts that have guided ourdiscussions aimed at defining the future of ourOrganization. Now  our task is to take stock of thelessons learned  of the good and the bad  in order tomake this sixtieth session the year of the UnitedNations reform.The outcome document adopted by heads of Stateand Government during this summit is a point ofdeparture. It is not yet the final result. It should be seenas the architecture that will lead us in the building ofthe new United Nations. It is crucial that we keep thereform momentum alive and implement as soon aspossible the changes demanded by the internationalcommunity and our Governments.In Mexicoís opinion  there are three key aspectsamong the lessons learned that need to be taken intoconsideration during the work of this sixtieth session ofthe General Assembly.First  reform of the system must becomprehensive. It will be very damaging  futile andinadequate if we decide to sacrifice a comprehensiveapproach by focusing our efforts on just one aspect ofthe reform. A great deal of the frustration stemmingfrom the summitís outcome occurred because of theextensive attention and time given to reform of theSecurity Council. We cannot deny the importance ofthis issue  but we should not hold the whole reformprocess hostage to the exclusive discussion of onesingle item.Throughout the long days of discussion prior tothe summit  it became evident that the issues whicharoused interest and triggered concern were those suchas human rights  development  the fight againstterrorism  the environment  the social agenda andmanagement reform. It is much clearer today than itwas two weeks ago that the United Nations inevitablyneeds to make simultaneous headway on those issuesof priority for the international community.Secondly  the most effective means of advancingthe reform process lies in genuine negotiations open toall interested States  with agreed timelines for bothadoption and implementation of the commitmentsreached. All delegations witnessed that  in the lastthree weeks prior to the summit  we were able to makemore and faster progress than during the previous longmonths of consultations and speeches. The summitacted as a catalyst for serious and committedintergovernmental negotiations. Then we were finallyable to perceive with the required precision eachMember State's limits and margins of flexibility. In thelight of that experience  we must turn to negotiations asthe most productive working method.Thirdly  in order to gain relevance andeffectiveness  the United Nations institutionalstructures should adapt to real global problems and notthe other way around. Otherwise  we could be in theabsurd situation of building institutions pleasing tohigh political and diplomatic circles but verydisappointing to the societies they are meant to serve.Discussions on the new Human Rights Councilillustrate that kind of failing. The number of membershas received far more attention than the mandates andtasks it should carry out in order to promote humandignity. It is urgent that this be reversed.Mr. Eliasson  you will be presiding over a veryunusual General Assembly session. Fruitless effortshave been made for years to find the formulas torevitalize the highest globally representative organ.Today  driven by the winds of reform and the need toease the Organizationís sense of crisis  the General28Assembly has rare momentum to steer the futurecourse of the United Nations. This is where majoragreements could be reached and where States'commitments will be recorded. Mexico is fullyconfident that  during your presidency  the GeneralAssembly will grow stronger as the main politicalforum for major global decision-making.As stated by the President of Mexico at the recentsummit (see A/60/PV.4)  we are at the starting point not at the finish line. Our task is incomplete  and it isurgent to establish a Peacebuilding Commission to putinto practice the concept of the ìresponsibility toprotectî; to establish a Human Rights Council thatcould make an immediate difference vis-a-vis theweaknesses and double standards that have tarnishedthe reputation of the Commission on Human Rights; tobegin negotiations on reform of the Security Council with the common purpose of putting in place the bestpossible collective security system  one that caneffectively face today's major threats.Development continues to be a priority amongthe aspirations and concerns on the global agenda.Mexico has made particularly important efforts in thisrealm. The International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  held in the Mexican city of Monterrey became a watershed in our approach to that subject. Apartnership between rich and developing countries wasforged for the first time ever  with the purpose offighting poverty head-on and defining financial targetsand timetables in that fight. We therefore particularlyappreciate the decision of those developed countriesthat have announced precise timetables and levels oftheir gross national product to be allocated for officialdevelopment assistance. We reiterate our call to the restof the economic Powers to move in that direction  andwe urge the developing countries to present  as soon aspossible  their own national strategies to ensure thatthey can access those resources. It is crucial that allparties fully meet their commitments. We cannot allowourselves to go backwards in this connection.The President of Mexico has asked me to put onrecord our disappointment at the fact that the summit'soutcome document did not include a section ondisarmament and non-proliferation. My delegation willjoin forces with other interested member States torestore this sensitive issue to the United Nationsagenda.For Mexico  which last April had the honour ofhosting the first Conference of States Parties andSignatories of Treaties That Establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones  disarmament and non-proliferation issues are a top priority on ourinternational agenda. Because of this  and because ofthe hazardous international scenario we haveexperienced in recent weeks  we consider it urgent tofind a way to end the paralysis faced by the multilateralforums dealing with this matter.Likewise  Mexico attaches great importance tothe agreement reached during the summit to finalize acomprehensive convention on the rights of personswith disabilities. We urge all Member States andObservers to continue their negotiations with a view tomaking sure that this instrument is adopted by theGeneral Assembly during its current session.Finally  I would like to comments on the sectionof the outcome document dealing with the rule of law.The rule of law in international relations is a rationalpreventive tool for settling disputes. The UnitedNations legal machinery constitutes an ally of theSecurity Council in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. Based on the comprehensive reformpromoted by my country  we deem it necessary forStates to reinforce their commitment to strengtheningthe International Court of Justice in a substantive way.Mexico will remain a firm promoter of UnitedNations reform and of seeking multilateral solutions toaddress the world's major problems. Through theGroup of Friends for United Nations Reform  andduring this critical year in the life of our Organization we will go on putting forward proposals andmechanisms to implement decisions. In this regard  Iwould like to echo President Fox's appreciation to hiscounterparts from Algeria  Australia  Canada  Chile Colombia  Germany  Japan  Kenya  the Netherlands New Zealand  Pakistan  Singapore  Spain and Swedenfor their intelligent and constructive contribution to thereform process. The diversity of views within theGroup and the decision to focus on delivering concreteproposals to solve the problems of the United Nations as well as those of the world  demonstrate that it isindeed feasible to reach agreements and translate theminto action. We are confident that this spirit will spreadthroughout the membership of the United Nations  andthat the sixtieth session will truly mark the beginningof the second phase in the life of our Organization."
"109",4566,"MHL",60,2005,"I wish to extendwarm greetings of iokwe from the people of theMarshall Islands as we gather for the sixtieth session ofthe Assembly. I am honoured to speak on behalf ofPresident Kessai H. Note  who had to leave New Yorkahead of schedule due to an urgent matter at home.Sixty years have passed since a visionary courseof action was charted recognizing that freedom  justiceand peace in the world are based on the inherentdignity  equality and inalienable rights of all. Theworld has felt the direct impact of the United Nations and we have good reason to be grateful. Criticsnotwithstanding  our Organization has served theglobal community and has touched every aspect of ourlives.The Marshall Islands is grateful for the UnitedNations  for without it  how could a small remoteisland nation express its concerns  be heard  and be oncommon ground with the rich and powerful?Five years after we made a unanimouscommitment to peace  liberty and sustainabledevelopment  we have gathered here again to takeconcrete measures. We approved last Friday aninstrument that the Secretariat and the GeneralAssembly can build upon in streamlining the UnitedNations and in meeting the many new challenges of thetwenty-first century.All aspects of life in the Marshall Islands havebeen profoundly affected by its extraordinary history which encompasses a Pacific war and the legacy ofnuclear testing. Its remoteness  size and vulnerabilitycontinue to limit opportunities for the economic growthof the Marshall Islands. In finding ways to worktogether for the betterment of the population traditional leaders and representatives of our nationaland local governments  non-governmentalorganizations  and private and public sectors convenedlast month in a special retreat - an opportunity foreveryone involved to build trust and to think and worktogether in crafting a shared vision that can and willensure the prosperity of the people. We continue tomove beyond words to action.We continue also to engage actively in regionalactivities in the Pacific  including through our regionalorganizations  such as the Pacific Islands Forum. Agreat deal of work has been done in the development ofthe Pacific Plan  a strategy for broader regionalcooperation based on the key goals of economicgrowth  sustainable development  good governance andsecurity. The Plan will be presented to Forum leaderswhen they meet next month. It will also be discussed atour small island States meeting  which the MarshallIslands chairs.In the international arena  we continue to reaffirmour solidarity with the Alliance of Small Island States.We are grateful for the support of the GeneralAssembly in its endorsement of the Declaration andStrategy for the Further Implementation of theProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Developmentof Small Island Developing States  adopted at theMauritius International Meeting last January. TheStrategy requires quick and practical action to addressthe unique challenges facing the sustainabledevelopment of small island developing States.The Marshall Islandsí small resource base limited market access  fragile environment vulnerability to climate change and variability  as well25as the high costs of energy  along with issues related toinfrastructure  transportation and communications  areamong the many constraints we face within the existinginternational economic environment. Our vulnerabilityto environmental and economic events continues toimpede our opportunities for development.Our development efforts will be in vain if theresults are reversed by continued degradation of theenvironment and depletion of natural resources.We are pleased that the Kyoto Protocol has nowentered into force. However  some major emittersremain outside of it. A more inclusive internationalframework needs to be developed for stabilizinggreenhouse-gas emissions beyond 2012  with broaderparticipation by all major emitters - developed anddeveloping countries.Climate change is a serious and long-termchallenge that has the potential to affect every part ofthe world. It is time to undertake concrete actions andmeasures at all levels. In that context  we welcome theprogress made in terms of the establishment anddevelopment of an all-hazard early warning system.United Nations international efforts were veryswift and effective in the wake of the devastatingtsunami in the Indian Ocean and  more recently following Hurricane Katrina in the southern UnitedStates. We hope that the international community willnot act so humanely only in the aftermath of naturaldisasters but also in the context of the far less dramatic but no less crucial global actions needed to mitigateclimate change and arrest sea-level rise before it is toolate to act and the people of the Marshall Islands andothers become environmental refugees.On health issues  the Marshall Islands continuesto face the challenges associated in dealing with majordiseases such as diabetes  influenza  bird flu  SARSand the risk of the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS and othersexually transmitted diseases. Despite the difficultieswe face in addressing these challenges  we are proudof  and grateful for  the involvement of the traditionalleadership  which has contributed to the substantialprogress made at the local and national levels.We are in the final stages of completing theHIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan. Our ambition tocarry out this task is strong  but we cannot do it alone.The support of the international community isextremely important to help build our capacity; tostrengthen our human resources; to help us implementeffective public education programmes that willencourage behavioural change among the high-riskgroups in our population; and to provide technicalassistance to facilitate prompt access to the GlobalFund and other financial sources to combat HIV/AIDS tuberculosis  diabetes and malaria.We have integrated family planning and maternaland child health programmes into reproductive healthservices  and we fully support the initiatives onaccessibility to reproductive health services under theMillennium Development Goals.On sustainable development  the Marshall Islandshas established a task force to ensure that theMillennium Development Goals are fully integratedinto our national strategy. One challenge we continueto face is the need for human and technical resources but  despite that and other challenges  we aredetermined to work towards achieving the Goals.During this  the first policy year of its firstimplementation cycle  we recognize the importantprecedent set by the thirteenth session of theCommission on Sustainable Development as to howfuture cycles could be conducted and what type ofoutcomes could be expected. The Marshall Islands isworking hard to improve access to freshwater  developenvironmentally responsible waste managementsystems and provide affordable and renewable energysources. Our programme would be impossible withoutthe continued support of the international communityand development partners  for which we are alwaysgrateful.One issue that continues to haunt the people ofthe Marshall Islands is the effects of nuclear weaponstesting. When people in most parts of the world talkabout nuclear devastation  they tend to think ofHiroshima and Nagasaki. However  few are aware thatthe Marshall Islands experienced the equivalent of 1.6Hiroshima-sized bombs every day during the 12 yearsthat numerous nuclear weapons were detonated andtested in our country. Interestingly  this took placewhile the Marshall Islands was part of the UnitedNations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.We would like to emphasize the need for fullresolution of this issue based on the changedcircumstances that have come to light and the newinformation gathered from recent scientific andmedical studies on radiological safety  clean-up and the26malignant effects of radiation on health. I call on theinternational community to support the MarshallIslands in this endeavour.The Marshall Islands has experienced the far-reaching and invasive effects of a nuclear testingprogramme on the most intimate and personal levels:from home islands no longer inhabitable to the illnessand death of many of our friends and families. We canprepare our health system to deal with this burden  butwe can never remedy the human and emotional toll thatthis has had and continues to have on us as individuals families  communities and as a nation.Concerning disarmament and non-proliferation we believe that sustainable peace and development willnot be achieved without major steps towardsdisarmament. Reiterating our firm commitment to theTreaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons we look forward to strengthening its implementation including through future review conferences.As a nation whose single most importantproductive sector and key export are its fisheries  thestate of the worldís oceans and fish stocks and howthese vital resources are being exploited remain ourutmost concern. We recognize the importance of theConvention on the Conservation and Management ofHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western andCentral Pacific Ocean. We remain seriously concernedabout instances of illegal  unreported and unregulatedfishing within our exclusive economic zone. Thecontinued assistance of the international community isneeded in building capacity for monitoring andsurveillance in this regard.The global threat the world faces today is achallenge of a different nature from anything we havehad to deal with before. We recognize how poverty environmental degradation and the abuse of humanrights undermine human security. We welcome therecent adoption of the International Convention for theSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. We continueto cooperate closely within the Pacific region to ensurethat effective regional action is taken to combat threatsto our peace and security. We have taken steps tocombat money-laundering and the financing ofterrorism and to implement the twelve core anti-terrorism conventions and relevant Security Councilresolutions. In our global effort to counter terrorism agreeing on the definition of terrorism is one of themany issues that requires serious consideration andresolution.Concerning the Middle East peace process  wecommend the determination and strong resolve ofPrime Minister Ariel Sharon in his effort toreinvigorate the Middle East peace process by fulfillingIsraelís pledge to withdraw from the Gaza Strip.Concerning the International Criminal Court  wewelcome its progress in the Democratic Republic of theCongo  Uganda and Darfur situations. We are alsopleased with the entry into force of the agreementbetween the International Criminal Court and theUnited Nations. We continue to call on all States tostrengthen the rule of law around the world by ratifyingthe Rome Statute governing that Court.Bearing in mind the phrase ""we the peoples"" inthe Preamble to the Charter  Marshall Islands believesthat if the United Nations adheres to the principles ofuniversality and self-determination  it must not excludethe 23 million people of the free  democratic andindependent nation of Taiwan. As a free andprosperous country  Taiwan has much to contribute tothe peace and security of the Western Pacific  and wereiterate our full support for the ongoing quest of thepeople of Taiwan to be granted membership in thisfamily of nations. Denying membership to a free anddemocratic nation and condoning the presence ofrepressive States is a flagrant violation of basicdemocratic principles.In a world divided by chasms between the richand the poor  between the powerful and the powerless differences of interest are certain to shape all ourreform efforts and perpetuate a contradictory anddivided Organization. We share the aspirations of aUnited Nations guided by the following values andprinciples: belief in multilateral cooperation  theimperative of prevention  respect for the rule of lawand human rights  solidarity with the poor andsuffering  concern for the rights of women and thechildren of the world and their future  and for thehealth of Planet Earth.We reiterate our support for reform and expansionof the Security Council  using a criteria-basedapproach based on factors such as economic size population  commitment to democracy and humanrights  financial contribution to the United Nations contributions to peacekeeping and record on counter-terrorism and non-proliferation.27The Marshall Islands will continue to participatein this sessionís important debates on how to reformand strengthen the United Nations as an institution andhow to ensure that it effectively addresses the threatsand challenges of the twenty-first century. We assureyou of our full cooperation towards the goal of astrong  effective and accountable Organization."
"110",4590,"MKD",60,2005,"It gives me great pleasure to address thisforum and to share with the General Assembly myGovernment’s views on issues of the highest relevanceto our Organization. But first of all  let me express oursolidarity and heartfelt condolences in connection withthe loss of life and the damage caused by HurricaneKatrina in our host country — the United States ofAmerica.I wish to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson ofSweden on his election to the post of President of theGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. I am sure thatunder his able guidance we will make substantialprogress in implementing the decisions adopted just afew days ago by the heads of State. At the same time 7let me congratulate Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon  Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session  for ajob well done. I would like also to commend Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his skilful leadership of theOrganization in what has turned out to be a verydifficult year.The High-level Meeting and the outcomedocument reaffirmed our commitment to the corevalues and principles of the United Nations Charterand to effective multilateralism  and it identified areasfor future action. The summit has also provided us witha unique opportunity to explore new ways to adapt theUnited Nations to new realities.The Organization was created 60 years ago.However  the vision of its founders — to bring about amore secure  democratic and developed world — needsto be pursued more vigorously today. As a wise manonce said  we should be both speakers of words anddoers of deeds. I am happy that we all agree that weneed a reformed  more effective and more credibleUnited Nations.The high-level segment made a fair assessment ofthe progress achieved in the implementation of theMillennium Declaration and of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs)  as well as of theoutcomes of the major United Nations conferences andsummits.The assessment by the world leaders was bothrealistic and upbeat. They boldly assessed the status ofcurrent and longstanding problems — extreme poverty hunger  disease  the HIV pandemic  child mortality environmental degradation  lack of good governance disregard for human rights and the rule of law — andshowed strength and resolve in defining steps andactions to be taken or reinforced in order to meet ourtargets  and they were cautiously optimistic about thedeadlines to be met.Today we live in a world in which our peoples nations and Governments depend on each other. Wemust recognize that in this interdependent andglobalized world  all threats are threats to us all. Noone is immune to them  nor does any single State havea cure.But how should we proceed? I believe that manyof us share the view that  in fact  we already have amultiplicity of documents and agreed positions  as wellas many political commitments and adopteddeclarations. Much has been achieved by the UnitedNations  and we are proud of that. My own country hasalso benefited from United Nations efforts — theUnited Nations engagement in the first-ever preventivedeployment mission. That was a good example of theeffectiveness of joint efforts and cooperation.However  turning to the main questions  we havefound that we are still lagging behind on some of theissues to which have so strongly committed ourselves.One of the avenues for moving forward involvesimplementation and visibility. These are not newwords. Many promising United Nations ideas andprojects have been sidelined due to inappropriatefollow-up and inadequate implementation measures  orsimply due to insufficient support and funding by theMember States. We should avoid such pitfalls.The sooner the effects of the implementation ofour decisions become visible  the greater internationalpublic support will be  and the greater the chances ofcreating a better world for us and for generations tocome. But we should not shy away from sharing thatresponsibility with all those who can assist us  withthose who have the capacity to help promote andimplement our goals. There are many positiveexamples in recent memory  beginning with the greaterinvolvement of regional organizations  the civil sector non-governmental organizations  the private sector  andso on. Let us make greater use of them. We can onlybenefit.On this occasion  I will not dwell in detail on theprocesses of United Nations reform and thestrengthening of the Organization. PresidentCrvenkovski elaborated Macedonia’s position on thoseissues here last week.Macedonia also aligns itself with the EuropeanUnion statement. Nevertheless  allow me to say a fewwords on some current United Nations reform issues ofparticular interest to us. Macedonia supports the viewthat human rights  the rule of law and democracyshould be given a prominent place in the UnitedNations reform proposals. Freedom from fear could besaid to sum up the whole philosophy of human rights as former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld put it.It has long been a strong position of my countrythat respect for those principles  coupled withdevelopment  is the best conflict-prevention measureand a vital precondition for peace and prosperity. Forthat reason  we see great merit in establishing a8peacebuilding commission. I trust that a balancedgender representation on the commission will only leadto its better functioning and give added value topeacebuilding. Furthermore  the establishment of thehuman rights council must be seen as a powerful toolto regain the values and principles originally envisagedby the creation of the United Nations.We are very satisfied that the concept of“responsibility to protect” has found its well-deservedplace for the first time in a United Nations documentand welcome its endorsement.The democracy fund is a noble idea whichdeserves our full creative engagement.Terrorism has turned into the plague of moderntimes. Since the last session of the General Assembly many atrocious terrorist attacks have taken placethroughout the world. Our firm commitment to fightingterrorism should engender more joint activities andactions. Our struggle must be based on full respect forhuman rights because it is human rights that terroristsare afraid of and seek to undermine. We need furtherconsolidation of the global anti-terrorist coalition andstrengthened cooperation with regional organizations.The United Nations is at the core of activities inthe area of counter-terrorism. The Republic ofMacedonia supports the elaboration of the UnitedNations comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy  asoutlined by the Secretary-General in Madrid. I wouldlike to appeal to the Member States to agree on thecomprehensive convention on international terrorism.This year  we took a significant step by adopting theInternational Convention for the Suppression of Actsof Nuclear Terrorism  which we signed on 16September. The victims of recent acts of terrorismpainfully remind us to move forward.From the very beginning  the Republic ofMacedonia has been a part of the international anti-terrorist coalitions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Peace anddemocracy-building in those two countries remain amongthe key challenges to the international community and tothe Iraqis and Afghans themselves. I would like onceagain to reiterate our support for their efforts to rebuildtheir countries and to create better lives for their people.Today  my country  Macedonia  is a functional multi-ethnic democracy. Over the past three years  wehave launched and carried out a large number of reformprojects. Our hard work has brought us closer to theEuro-Atlantic structures. We have developed genuinepartnerships with the Union and the alliance. Weexpect the European Commission to give a positiveevaluation of our achievements and Macedonia to begranted the status of candidate at the December 2005summit. I firmly believe that the time has come for ourEuropean perspective to turn into a European reality. Asfor the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  we expect theinvitation to join at the next enlargement summit.The Government has recently announced itseconomic programme  primarily aimed at increasingeconomic growth and reducing unemployment. At thesame time  it has intensified the development of aclimate favourable to foreign investment and safebusiness conduct. As a critical complement toeconomic reforms  Macedonia is also focused onreform of the judiciary and the fight against organizedcrime and corruption. We have set a goal to do better.The reforms are not easy  but we are firm in ourresolve to implement them.Regional cooperation has become a majorcharacteristic of the foreign policies of all countries inSouth-East Europe. We have been patiently building anew spirit of cooperation  while at the same timelearning the true meaning of developing relations basedon mutual trust and solidarity. That includes ourbilateral relations  as well as a large number of regionalinitiatives. Recognizing that reality and the need tocooperate and to build good-neighbourly relations andmutual confidence was not an easy undertaking  but itis the only way ahead. We take pride in seeing theregion move forward. The Republic of Macedonia willcontinue even more vigorously to pursue such policy.There is no alternative to dialogue and all outstandingregional issues should be resolved in that manner.In closing  I am confident that our deliberationswill contribute to better and faster follow-up of thecommitments agreed at the High-level PlenaryMeeting. I believe that we can soon come up withimplementation mechanisms that will give life to whatwas conceived by our leaders. There were manydebates  some of them very contradictory  showinghow different we are. But diversity should not preventus from having a common vision and goals for a betterfuture. That is why we are here at the United Nations."
"111",4677,"MLT",60,2005,"I would first like tocongratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson upon his election to the10presidency of the General Assembly at its sixtiethsession. He has an important and challenging taskahead. In carrying out his duties  he can be assured ofmy full support and of that of the Maltese delegation.I take this opportunity to express our appreciationto the outgoing President of the fifty-ninth session  HisExcellency Mr. Jean Ping. The last 12 months havedemanded exceptional leadership and commitmentfrom the presidency of the General Assembly. I wish tojoin others in congratulating Mr. Ping on the firm andsuccessful way in which he has guided this Assemblyin the preparations leading to the summit which wasjust concluded.The summit has passed on to us significant tasksin the continuing endeavour to sustain and reinforcethe processes of multilateral cooperation. It is right thatwe should take as the central theme of our discussionsthe follow-up and implementation of the summitconclusions.In the light of the discussions our leaders had lastweek  we approach these responsibilities all the moreinspired by the imperative for collective action. Suchaction is incumbent on the international community  asmuch in dealing with the short-term challenges it has toovercome as in defining the long-term objectiveswhich it seeks to achieve.Among the most immediate and visiblechallenges confronting us is the way in which werespond to the natural disasters which at one time oranother engulf peoples and societies around the world.The past 12 months have produced awesome evidenceof the way in which humanity remains subject to theforces of nature.The tsunami late last year and Hurricane Katrinaonly a few weeks ago are only the most prominentamong recent major catastrophes which intensify bothour sense of vulnerability and our sense of solidarity.In extending our expression of grief and sympathy tothe Governments and people afflicted by suchdisasters  the Maltese people have also extended theiroffers of succour and relief.While times like these remind us that nature canbe unpredictable in its ferocity  they also teach us thatit must always be treated with respect. If managedresponsibly  nature’s resources can improve our livesconsiderably. However  if those resources areruthlessly exploited  humanity will be the ultimateloser.It is unfortunate but true that the blind forces ofnature are not the only cause of extensive sufferingamong fellow human beings. Political and economicdevelopments  over which Governments  individuallyor collectively  have at least some element of control are also factors in play. Nowhere are the combinationof natural and man-made causes more dramatic than inthose instances of unregulated and often tragicmigration flows.Over the last few years  Malta  like manycountries  has been caught in the worrisome increase ofunregulated human trafficking across theMediterranean. In our case  as a small island with avery high population density  the problem quicklyassumed crisis proportions.Malta has a strong and longstanding commitmentto help those who need humanitarian assistance. Weshall stand by that. We are deeply conscious that long-term action in this area needs to be premised onprofound respect for human dignity and strictadherence to the rule of law  including internationalhumanitarian law.However  the international community must notallow the rights of refugees and persons requiringhumanitarian status in accordance with internationallaw to be undermined and prejudiced by internationalcriminal organizations specialized in human traffickingactivity. In our case  our ability to respond to genuinecases is fast becoming overwhelmed by the hugeincrease in illegal immigrants  who are the object of aninternational criminal network of human traffickers.Illegal immigration constitutes a collapse of theinternational legal order and must be addressedunequivocally by the world community as such inorder to ensure that the rule of international law isrestored in that regard. Countries of origin and transitneed to assume their responsibility to uphold the ruleof law by vigorously clamping down on internationalcriminal activity in human trafficking. The UnitedNations and its agencies  particularly the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  arecalled on to address this issue  which  if it is notaddressed  could prejudice the rights of genuinerefugees and persons qualifying for humanitarian statusin accordance with international law.11At the same time  the spirit of solidarity inspiringaction in this area needs also to be put to use inaddressing the roots of illegal economic migration  aphenomenon that is harmful not only to the individualsthemselves — who fall victim to callous criminalorganizations  often paying with their lives — but alsoto the economic and social development of thecountries of origin.For that reason  we welcome the summitstatement reaffirming the principle of solidarity andburden-sharing with regard to assisting genuinerefugee populations and their host communities. In thatcontext  we look forward to the General Assembly’shigh-level dialogue on international migration anddevelopment  to take place in 2006. It will give us animportant further opportunity to discuss themultidimensional aspects of that problem and identifyappropriate ways of dealing with them. Malta will takean active and constructive part in that dialogue.Last week’s summit provided important newguidelines in many critical areas requiring collectiveaction. In the area of development cooperation  therehas been a rededication to the objectives first definedin the Millennium Development Goals. Malta joins itspartners in the European Union in strengthening itscommitment towards increased and more effectivedevelopment assistance in the coming years. We haveset ambitious goals for the successful completion bynext year of the World Trade Organization’s DohaRound of multilateral trade negotiations.Malta’s national contribution will becommensurate with its possibilities and its level ofeconomic development. Nevertheless  it will takeinspiration from our constant endeavour to strengthenand enlarge the areas of peace  prosperity and securityfor all peoples of the world. We will have a renewedopportunity to reaffirm those commitments inNovember  when Malta hosts the next CommonwealthHeads of Government Meeting and assumes thechairmanship of the Commonwealth for the next twoyears.Peace and prosperity must be rooted in humandignity. Our leaders devoted a significant part of theirdiscussions last week to the question of human rights.The summit decisions on this subject may not havegone as far as some of us would have wished.Nevertheless  they were an important step towards theobjective of equipping the United Nations with a moreeffective institutional structure to deal with the defenceand promotion of human rights worldwide. In thecurrent session of the General Assembly  we will aimto bring to fruition the summit’s decisions in the areaof human rights  especially the establishment of theHuman Rights Council.Another area where questions of human dignityare of paramount importance relates to the principle ofthe responsibility to protect. Our leaders have taken abrave step by reconciling the different strands of thatprinciple  which seeks to encapsulate an importantmoral duty in the development of the law of nations.Respect for State sovereignty  the strict parameters onthe use of force and the overarching commitment torespect and defend human dignity and the right to lifeowed to all individual human beings are all vitalaspects of the decisions taken by the summit in thisregard. Further work in that area must continue to beinspired by the sense of solidarity which is shared bypeople around the world and the common  worldwideethical responsibility to act to defend the innocent.Effective post-conflict peacebuilding is animportant dimension in which the internationalcommunity can give practical expression to the notionof collective responsibility. We therefore stronglywelcome the agreement to establish the PeacebuildingCommission  which underlines and reinforces theUnited Nations capacity in the area of peacekeepingand peacebuilding. That is an area of internationalcooperation where the interface between action at theregional and global levels is critical. The task entrustedto us by the summit to finalize the modalities of thePeacebuilding Commission by December this year isamong the most far-reaching responsibilities of thecurrent session of the General Assembly.Another area where international cooperation isespecially important concerns the fight againstterrorism. Notwithstanding the differences that mightremain on the precise interpretation and scope of theconcept  there is a widespread commitment to resistingand eliminating that outrageous and horrific attack onthe everyday order and serenity of life in our societiesand the right of ordinary people to a secure andpeaceful life. On the basis of that recognition  we urgeimmediate steps to intensify and expand concreteactions that respond to the immediate concerns of ourcitizens. The elements of a counter-terrorism strategyannounced by the Secretary-General earlier this yearprovide a useful pointer in the right direction.12We need to take our collective action againstterrorism further. Malta believes that no terrorist actionis ever excusable  and our action against terrorism mustbe unequivocal  firm and decisive at all times and in allinstances. However  we must deeply analyse andexamine the roots of the problem. In particular  wemust not be passive when we see situations around theworld where States have been unable to provide asocial welfare net for their peoples and where  as aconsequence  the poor and the desperate conglomeratearound extremist organizations  which may alsopractice terror while simultaneously providing welfareassistance to strengthen their popular base. Socialresponsibility for the provision of welfare should be inthe hands of the State  which represents society in allits diversity. In my view  it is imperative thatinternational development programmes should alsohave that particular focus. The ultimate objective of thecurrent session of the General Assembly shouldcontinue to be progress towards the conclusion of acomprehensive convention on international terrorism.Aside from agreeing on a new set of tasks andmeasures for reform  at last week’s summit our leadersreaffirmed and further developed the concepts andprinciples that lie at the heart of the United Nations.Those concepts and principles will inspire thedeliberations of the Assembly’s current session as itconsiders the many specific issues on its agenda.Issues of peace and security are a major part ofthat agenda. They are particularly poignant today  theInternational Day of Peace.Malta welcomes the recent evolution of thesituation in Palestine  marked by Israel’sdisengagement from the occupied territories in Gazaand parts of the West Bank. We urge the partiesconcerned to maintain the momentum for peace thathas been created. We acknowledge and salute the boldand tough decisions taken by both the Israeli and thePalestinian leadership  which are making thisdevelopment possible. We have a clear sense of thecomplexities and sensitivities involved for both sidesin pursuing their respective actions.Together with our partners in the EuropeanUnion  Malta wishes to encourage this latestdevelopment as a path towards the full resumption ofthe Middle East peace process. This calls for acontinuing determination by both sides not to allowobstacles to stand in the way of their carrying out thenext set of actions called for under the Quartet roadmap: Israel’s freezing of all settlement activity  and thecessation of all violent attacks by Palestinians againstIsraelis everywhere.We are convinced that the ultimate objective —the existence of two neighbouring  viable sovereignStates  living in peace and security  is within reach andcertainly worth the effort and sacrifice involved at thisstage.In the Mediterranean  regional cooperationcontinues to be strengthened through the Barcelonaprocess and other initiatives for subregionalconsultation. Within the broader framework of theEuropean Neighbourhood Policy  countries to the northand the south of the Mediterranean are workingtogether on a wide range of actions to further peace prosperity and progress in their region.Those actions include areas of primary interestfor Malta and its immediate neighbours  such as themanagement of migration flows  the promotion ofhuman rights  democratization  counter-proliferationand counter-terrorism efforts  the acceleration ofincreased market integration and the objective ofimproving the social and economic living conditions ofall peoples in the region  especially the mostvulnerable among them. The further economic  socialand political integration of the Euro-Mediterraneanregion is the primary challenge of the countriesbelonging to it and would have beneficialconsequences for the international community as awhole.Malta is particularly interested in developmentsrelating to the future enlargement of the EuropeanUnion. Following the entry of Bulgaria and Romania in2007  the next stages of that process could encompassa number of countries in our region  such as Croatiaand Turkey. Malta believes that the further enlargementof the Union would provide an impetus for positivereform in European countries in general and for thecreation of a wider European area of peace  stability democracy and human rights dedicated to theprosperity of its peoples in a spirit of solidarity.Malta welcomes the fact that the European Unionis increasingly acting as a promoter of peace andcooperation in regions beyond its immediate vicinity.That is the case with regard to the framework for widercooperation provided by the Strategic Partnership withthe Mediterranean and the Middle East.13The expansion of political rights and politicalparticipation is an essential dimension of the broaderstrategy to combat extremism in its variousmanifestations throughout the world. Malta welcomesthe intensifying transatlantic engagement in this regardwhich  especially in the Middle East  seeks to fosterwider participation in support of home-growneconomic  political and educational reform efforts forsocieties in the region.The European Union is also cooperatingincreasingly with the African Union in theimplementation of actions and decisions agreed withinthe framework of the United Nations. We hope that thatencouraging development will further reinforce themany peacekeeping  humanitarian relief andreconciliation efforts under way in many parts of theAfrican continent.The institutional set-up and functioning of theUnited Nations have been the subject of intensescrutiny in recent months. This has laid bare some ofthe weaknesses of our Organization. At the same time it has highlighted the many areas in which ourOrganization is playing a unique and indispensable rolein the process of multilateral cooperation. Regrettably instances of human and institutional failures have beenbrought to light. At the same time  the much largernumber of instances where the institutions are workingwell and where individuals are acting with admirablecommitment and dedication have also been givenprominence. In particular  developments in recentmonths have placed in a sharper focus the commitmentand dedication of the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan in carrying out his exceptionally complex anddemanding task.I would like to take this opportunity to expressour deepest admiration and support for the Secretary-General for the major contribution that he has beenmaking towards effective multilateralism and respectfor the international rule of law.Our challenges have never been as global as theyare today. Recent natural disasters have emphasized toall of us our vulnerability as the human race.Globalization in all its aspects  including globalcommunication  has not only brought home to us theimmediacy of events and information  but has alsofurther accelerated dynamic change in all aspects —political  economic and social — in all societies onEarth. The situation of constant flux and dynamicchange further increases the need for the UnitedNations to be a reformed  effective focal point for theinternational community  one that is ready to respondto  and proactively work to meet  the challenges ofpeace  security and development.This year  which marks the sixtieth anniversary ofthe United Nations  it is useful for us to approach theexercise of reform keeping in mind the words of theSecretary-General in his report  “In larger freedom” that“the principles and purposes of the UnitedNations  as set out in the Charter  remain as validand relevant today as they were in 1945  and thatthe present moment is a precious opportunity toput them into practice”. (A/59/2005  para. 153)."
"112",4723,"MMR",60,2005,"I wish first of all tocongratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtiethsession. We are convinced that  given his extensiveexperience in international relations  this session willhave a fruitful outcome. My delegation pledges itssupport and full cooperation in his endeavours for thesuccess of this historic session. I should like also toconvey to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  deepappreciation for his efforts in promoting the nobleideals and causes of our Organization.The strength of our Organization lies in itsuniversality and legitimacy  anchored in the Charter ofthe United Nations and in the fundamental principlesof international law. Among these cardinal principlesare respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and8equality of States  non-interference in their internalaffairs and the non-use or threat of use of force.International issues today are of such a scale andcomplexity that they can be resolved only throughmultilateralism and by collective action founded on thevalues of solidarity and universality  as embodied inthe United Nations. Only by working together can wehope to discharge our responsibilities. We must at thesame time ensure the Organization’s credibility byadapting it to the global realities of the twenty-firstcentury.The High-level Plenary Meeting provided auseful impetus towards meeting the goals andchallenges of the twenty-first century. The outcomedocument of the 2005 world summit included measuresto strengthen the United Nations. My delegation wishesto underscore the need to preserve and promote thecentrality of the General Assembly as the highestdeliberative and decision-making organ of the UnitedNations. Myanmar also agrees that the SecurityCouncil should be reformed to reflect world realities soas to be more effective. Since the Council has primaryresponsibility for world peace and security  the processof its expansion should be managed with the utmostseriousness. Any decision in that respect should bearrived on the basis of the broadest possible agreementof the membership.In the context of the reform process  we mustavoid the introduction of new concepts that have nobasis either in the Charter or in international law.Acceptance of such concepts would go against theprinciples of sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-interference  which form the very basis of the systemof international relations.I am happy to see that the outcome documentcontains elements that we hold dear. The documentunderscores in particular the obligation of all MemberStates to refrain from the threat or use of force in anymanner inconsistent with the Charter of the UnitedNations. Charter provisions provide the necessaryprinciples for the use of force as a last resort. We havealways strongly held the view that Article 51 of theCharter  which deals with the right of individual orcollective self-defence  should not be rewritten orreinterpreted.We believe  however  that there some areasremain that should be further revisited in order toaddress our concerns.Regarding the establishment of the PeacebuildingCommission as an intergovernmental advisory body we feel strongly that there must be adequaterepresentation by developing countries in theOrganizational Committee. Developing countries havea strong case  since they are major contributors ofmilitary personnel and civilian police to UnitedNations missions.In strengthening human rights mechanisms  wemust address the root causes of problems  namely  theuse of selectivity  double standards and politicization.It must be borne in mind that the Charter places humanrights in the context of international cooperation.During this session  we will be considering themandate  modalities  function  size  composition membership  working methods and procedures of theenvisaged Human Rights Council. Given theimportance that we all place on human rights developing countries must play an active role in thenegotiation process. We would like to see the initiationof open  transparent and inclusive negotiations at anearly date.The threats we face today do not respect nationalboundaries; they are interconnected and complex.Terrorism  illicit drug trafficking  transnationalorganized crime  weapons of mass destruction  povertyand hunger  and the alarming spread of highlyinfectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS  tuberculosisand malaria are some of the threats we can ignore onlyat our peril. Efforts and strategies to tackletransnational issues need to be coordinated at all levelsand carried out with the necessary respect for thesovereignty and territorial integrity of States.My country is a State party to the United NationsConvention against Transnational Organized Crime andits supplementary Protocols to Prevent  Suppress andPunish Trafficking in Persons  especially Women andChildren  and against the Smuggling of Migrants byLand  Sea and Air. It has enacted legislation to controlmoney laundering and to render mutual legal assistanceto combat transnational crime. It is a State party toalmost all of the United Nations conventions onterrorism. It has also actively participated in regionaland international efforts against international crime.Myanmar is against all forms and manifestationsof terrorism. Myanmar is of the view that terrorismshould be combated in accordance with internationallaw and obligations. The issue should not be used as a9pretext for intervention in the internal affairs of otherStates.Sixty years after the Second World War  theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction particularly of nuclear weapons  remains a formidablechallenge. Nuclear proliferation is on the increase  andthere is also considerable concern that non-State actorscould gain access to such materials and technologies.All States must take action in a multilateral frameworkto make substantive progress towards disarmament including nuclear disarmament  and nuclear-weaponStates should reaffirm their commitment to negativesecurity assurances vis-à-vis non-nuclear States. Theoutcome document  however  failed to address theimportant issue of disarmament and non-proliferation.This is an issue of great importance  and we shouldmake every effort to ensure that this vital issue is notsidelined in international forums.At the twentieth special session of the GeneralAssembly  on narcotic drugs  it was emphasized that nosingle State can combat the scourge of narcotic drugson its own. In my country  the problem of narcoticdrugs is a bitter colonial legacy. We have thereforemade the elimination of narcotic drugs a nationalresponsibility and have formulated strategies andtactics to end the problem of opium poppy cultivationthrough a 15-year comprehensive plan and thesupplementary New Destiny Project. These effortshave resulted in a drastic reduction in opium poppyproduction. As a result  the United Nations Office onDrugs and Crime (UNODC) reported a 73 per centdecline between 1996 and 2004. Myanmar’s efforts toeradicate poppy cultivation  opium and heroinproduction and drug trafficking and abuse complementthe objectives set forth by the United Nations.Myanmar is also taking urgent measures with itsneighbouring countries to exercise control overillegally trafficked precursor chemicals used in theproduction of synthetic drugs. We have developedbilateral  trilateral and multilateral cooperation in thesubregional  regional and international contexts.World leaders pledged in the MillenniumDeclaration that the world of 2015 would be better thanthe one in which we live today. They made a solemncommitment to implement the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). To achieve the MDGs both the developed and the developing countries mustact in a cooperative manner. The developed countries in particular  must fulfil their commitments and meetthe internationally agreed official developmentassistance target of 0.7 per cent of their gross nationalproduct. Debt relief must also be provided todeveloping countries  including grant-based financingand 100 per cent debt cancellation.In Myanmar  we are making satisfactory progresstowards reaching the Millennium Development Goalsby 2015. In our drive to eradicate poverty we haveachieved significant results through the designation of24 special development zones in the states anddivisions of the country  in order to achieve equitableand balanced development throughout the country.Myanmar is endeavouring to achieve developmentmainly relying on its own resources without assistance particularly from international financial institutions.With external financial assistance  however  ourdevelopment efforts can be accelerated.Myanmar is a multi-ethnic nation comprisingover 100 races. Immediately after independence  thecountry had to face the scourge of insurgency. This hasposed a serious impediment to our nationaldevelopment endeavours. Based on the bitter lessons ofthe past  we have today embarked on a programme tomake law  order and national stability prevail. As weare able to build peace and stability  we have been ableto focus our attention on economic development giving priority to human resource development. Whileendeavouring to achieve comprehensive developmentof the country  we are at the same time implementing aseven-step political programme for a smooth transitionto a democratic State.In this regard  understanding and support fromthe international community would enable us toachieve our cherished goal more expeditiously.Unwarranted pressures will  however  delay ourprogress. We  for our part  are resolute in ourdetermination to achieve our goal of establishing amodern democratic State.Myanmar is poised on the threshold of a new era.We are at a point when all our attention must bedevoted to crossing the threshold and entering a newera."
"113",4780,"MNG",60,2005,"Let me begin bycongratulating the President of the fifty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly  His Excellency Mr. JeanPing  for his tireless efforts in the lead-up to thesummit meeting and for his contribution to theelaboration and adoption of the outcome document(resolution 60/1). Mongolia considers the outcomedocument  with all its omissions  to be anotherimportant milestone in forging global consensus ondevelopment  and pledges to contribute its modestshare to the successful implementation of thecommitments contained therein. In this connection  Iwould also like to commend our Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his leadership and vision and towish him well in his bold reform activities. I alsowarmly congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson on his well-deserved election to the presidency and express ourconfidence that his skill  experience and intimateknowledge of the matters at hand will enable us tosuccessfully follow through on the commitments madeby our leaders last week in this Assembly.Mongolia is poised to achieve most of itsMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) on education gender  child and maternal health and combatingvarious diseases by 2015. Capitalizing on its 1990ssystem of public health and education and a traditionalculture of gender equality  Mongolia is well on track toachieve  by 2015  universal primary education andliteracy  eliminate gender disparity at all levels ofeducation  and reduce its child mortality rate by twothirds and maternal mortality rate by three fourths.However  the most important goal of halving povertyby 2015 looks highly elusive  if not unachievable  atthe moment. Aware of its responsibility for its owndevelopment  Mongolia has  by and large  managed itspublic finances responsibly and maintainedmacroeconomic stability. It has done its utmost toadopt and implement sound national policies anddevelopment strategies and to introduce goodgovernance and the rule of law.Yet  like many other small  vulnerable andcommodity-dependent economies  Mongolia’sdevelopment is severely handicapped by many factorswell beyond its control. Skyrocketing oil prices  forinstance  are taking a serious toll on economic growth engulfing whatever gains we made earlier on  and areexposing already vulnerable societies to increasedhardship and uncertainty. Many frustrated oil-importing developing countries have articulated anumber of interesting ideas during this general debate and we urge the international financial institutions andthe oil producers to heed our collective appeal.Last week world leaders once again reaffirmedtheir commitment to address the special needs of thelandlocked countries and their special difficulties inintegrating into multilateral trading systems. Full timely and effective implementation of the AlmatyProgramme of Action and the Sao Paulo Consensusadopted at the eleventh session of the United NationsConference on Trade and Development will provide asignificant boost to the development and poverty19reduction efforts of the landlocked countries  includingMongolia. Mongolia spends a significant portion of itsgross domestic product (GDP) on transit transportationand insurance costs through its two neighbours  Russiaand China  roughly double the transportation costs ofother developing countries. Since 1998  Mongolia hasbeen negotiating with these two neighbours on aframework agreement on transit transport to reducetransit transportation costs and related cumbersomeprocedures  both in crossing the land border and intrans-shipment at ports. Six rounds of talks ended forthe most part inconclusively  but we hope that with therenewed commitment of our leaders to the AlmatyDeclaration  agreement will be within our collectivereach.Mongolia is a small economy  highly vulnerableto commodity market fluctuations and weather andclimatic conditions. The call made in the SummitOutcome document (resolution 60/1) on the need tosupport the efforts of commodity-dependent countriesto restructure  diversify and strengthen thecompetitiveness of their commodity sectors merits aswift response from the international community. Inthis regard  I wish to draw the attention of thisAssembly to the important recommendations derivedfrom the Multi-Stakeholder Consultations organized bythe New Rules for the Global Finance Coalition inpreparation for the summit. Recommendations includecommodity price arrangements and stabilization toolsand the establishment of a rapid-responding overarching  grant-financed shocks facility for low-income commodity-dependent countries. Immediateestablishment of such a facility would make a tangiblecontribution to our efforts to reduce poverty.Mongolia is highly susceptible to naturaldisasters  which cause loss of life and extensivedamage to its economy. In addition  desertification deforestation and soil erosion hamper our developmentefforts. We urge the international community toredouble its efforts to address these trans-boundarythreats collectively. For our part  we will continue totake specific measures in combating desertification  inusing land resources properly and in protecting forestsby introducing and implementing special protectivestrategies.Despite an encouraging increase in officialdevelopment assistance (ODA) in recent years  after adecade of steady decline  the world is still well short ofachieving the long-standing target of 0.7 per cent ofGDP. We are encouraged that the war against povertywill now be waged more aggressively with thecommitment of the world leaders to increase ODA todeveloping countries by $50 billion a year by the year2010. However  it is imperative to increase the aidquantity to a sufficient level to make multipleinvestments in the health  education and economicinfrastructure needed to break cycles of deprivationand ensure sustained growth. Furthermore  the qualityof aid has to be improved  as per the principles of theParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness of March 2005 with a particular emphasis on providing stable andpredictable multi-year financing  and with a focus ondevelopment goals  mutual accountability  buildinginstitutional capacity  untying aid  reducing transactioncosts and bureaucratic procedures and increasing therecipient’s ownership of aid.Mongolia fully endorses the recommendation ofthe Secretary-General that  starting in 2005  developingcountries with sound  transparent and accountablenational strategies should receive a sufficient increasein aid  of sufficient quality and timeliness to enablethem to achieve their Millennium Development Goals.In addition  new and innovative sources of financing including an International Finance Facility  quick-impact initiatives and debt-conversion for MDGimplementation projects should urgently be put inplace.Mongolia  for one  resolves to introduce freeschool lunches  starting with those for primaryschoolchildren  as a quick-impact initiative.Despite the importance of aid for developingcountries  trade and investment play a pivotal role inensuring sustainable development. According to the2005 Human Development Report  trade barriers facedby developing countries exporting to developedcountries are three to four times higher than thosefaced by developed countries when they trade witheach other. The current multilateral trade negotiationshave not produced a tangible outcome that would meetour expectations from the Doha development agenda.The Doha Round  to be successful  should result inestablishing fairer and more favourable terms of tradefor developing countries  especially those with specialneeds  in the form of enhanced and predictable marketaccess and assistance in building productive and tradecapacities. Mongolia appreciates the decision of theEuropean Union to provide duty-free access to over7 200 goods from small and vulnerable economies 20including Mongolia  under the special GeneralizedSystem of Preferences Plus scheme. Increased andbetter access means that more families will be able toleave destitution and poverty behind.The Summit Outcome emphasized once again theimportance of a timely  effective  comprehensive anddurable solution to the debt problems of developingcountries. In assessing the eligibility of countries fordebt relief  we urge the donor community not to limititself to mere statistics or rigid categorizations such as“least developed countries”. Debt relief should beconsidered comprehensively  taking into account thehistory and impact of the debt on the development ofthe recipient country and its actual capacity to repay.Many of these factors were taken into account whenMongolia negotiated its debt repayment with Russia. Iwould like to take this opportunity to express from thispodium the gratitude of my Government to theGovernment of the Russian Federation for its displayof solidarity and political and economic pragmatism inresolving this issue  so important for us.We believe that education is an engine fordevelopment  a guarantee of the respect for humanrights and a pillar of democracy. Mongolia has madesubstantial efforts in the second half of the last centuryto develop its education system. As a result  the adultliteracy rate has reached 97.8 per cent. Nonetheless taking stock of our recent past  we have drawn lessonsso as to further improve the deliverables of theeducation system. Stronger emphasis is now placed onvocational and technical training  the quality ofeducation  addressing functional illiteracy against thebackdrop of the rapid advance of information andcommunications technology and the universal usage ofEnglish. These policy measures are taken inaccordance with the Dakar Framework for Action andthe United Nations Literacy Decade.Mongolia welcomes the strong focus on humanrights  rule of law and democracy in the SummitOutcome. Democracy and rule of law are not part of astate of affairs that can be arranged or introducedovernight. We believe that fostering democracy andrule of law is a continuous process  and we hope thatthis long-term  sustained approach will prevail in theactivities of United Nations institutions. We supportthe efforts of the United Nations to make democracy auniversal environment for global governance. Webelieve that the United Nations Democracy Fund is animportant product in the overall reform process  as ithighlights the importance of democracy and the role ofthe Organization. Mongolia believes that the Fundshould serve as a vital instrument to assist MemberStates in the consolidation of democracy andimplementation of their commitments  including theUlaanbaatar Declaration and Plan of Action adopted atthe fifth International Conference of New or RestoredDemocracies in 2003 and approved by the GeneralAssembly in its resolution 58/13.We all agree that the United Nations must bestrengthened to meet the challenges of the newmillennium. This will be an all-encompassing task thatwould involve system-wide reform of the Organizationto bring it in line with the realities of our era including  where necessary  changes in composition mandates  procedures and working methods of theprincipal and subsidiary organs  the variousprogrammes and funds  as well as the establishment ofnew or reinvigoration of existing bodies. Overall United Nations assistance needs to be focused  results-oriented and tailored to the priority development needsof the countries concerned. It has to be designed tobring a tangible and speedy impact on the lives ofordinary people and to help them escape the trap ofpoverty and live in dignity  free from want.Accountability  oversight  management performanceand transparency of the Secretariat must be brought toa new level of efficiency  professionalism and ethicalconduct on a par with the best corporate governancepractices.Mongolia supports the idea of empowering theSecretary-General  the chief administrative officer ofthe United Nations  with greater authority andflexibility in administering the work of theOrganization in line with the Charter’s provisions. Alltoo often  sound management reforms proposed by theSecretary-General have been stalled by us  the MemberStates.In conclusion  Mr. President  let me voiceMongolia's confidence that we collectively willsucceed in reforming our world Organization  and therenewed and reinvigorated United Nations will bebetter equipped to address effectively the manifoldchallenges that lie ahead."
"114",4821,"MOZ",60,2005,"Allow me tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election as President ofthe General Assembly at the sixtieth session. We aredelighted to see a distinguished son of Sweden and afriend of Mozambique in the stewardship of this bodyand wish to express our confidence that  under yourable leadership  our deliberations will producesuccessful results. I would like to take this opportunityto pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Jean Ping  for the remarkable mannerin which he spearheaded the deliberations of the fifty-ninth session of General Assembly. May I alsocommend the Secretary-General for his continuedvision and leadership in our collective efforts to pursuethe fundamental ideals of the United Nations  inparticular the implementation of the internationalagenda for peace and development highlighted in hisreport (A/59/2005). We encourage him to continue hisoutstanding work.We gather here today inspired by the spirit oftogetherness and collective vision on the path that weshould strive to continue to travel in order to achieveour common aspirations  as underscored throughout thedeliberations of the High-level Plenary Meeting. Wemust seize this momentum to reinforce multilateralismas a guiding principle upon which the internationalcommunity should rely to adequately face today'schallenges. We believe that the emphasis of the WorldSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) on the vitalimportance of an effective multilateral system and ourdetermination to fulfil the commitments we set forourselves will generate and galvanize good momentumfor action aimed at tangible results.As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  we should reflect on what we want theOrganization to be and on what role each country andregion should play in these collective endeavours. Inrecognizing inclusiveness and the equal rights of menand women and of all nations  the Charter of theUnited Nations builds on our diverse cultural andtraditional values to unite us around our commonhumanity. Our failure to overcome the poverty trap inwhich developing countries are caught  as well as theconstant threat posed by terrorism  indicates the needfor an international system that is more inclusive anddemocratic and that conforms to the Charter of theUnited Nations and the relevant provisions ofinternational law. It is our firm belief that the UnitedNations continues to be an indispensable instrument forachieving those objectives. Thus  the strength of theOrganization must be high on our agenda. We ought toimprove its performance by reforming its organs andstructures.Therefore  it is our sincere hope that UnitedNations reform will help to foster strong relationshipsand cooperative links of coordination among all itsprincipal organs  in particular the General Assembly the Security Council and the Economic and SocialCouncil.Security Council reform should be aimed atbuilding transparency  democracy  openness andconsistency with regard to all regions represented inthe Organization. In that regard  the growing politicalcommitment and involvement of Africa in theinternational agenda for peace and stability calls forenhanced representation on the Security Council.We hope that the recently proposed PeacebuildingCommission will help to keep sustained internationalattention on countries in transition from post-conflictsituations to recovery and long-term development andensure continued support for them. Indeed  theexperience of Mozambique's transition from a post-conflict situation to reconstruction and developmenttestifies to the valuable contribution and impact of theconcerted support provided by the United Nations and25the international community for peace anddevelopment efforts.The adoption of the Millennium Declaration andthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) gave newmomentum to our quest to fight poverty  acceleratehuman development and facilitate the gradual andeffective integration of the developing world into theglobal economy. Despite the less ambitious outcome ofthe recently concluded summit  the time has come tobuild a genuine international partnership and toreaffirm our political will to fully implementinternationally agreed commitments.We need to work diligently to implement thecommitments made in Monterrey. In that regard  theestablishment of a detailed calendar for theimplementation of the goals set on financing fordevelopment is vital to generate access to additionalfinancial support for developing countries. To that end we welcome the decision by the European Union to setcollective and specific targets with a view to reachingthe internationally agreed target of devoting 0.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to officialdevelopment assistance (ODA) by 2015.The sustainable development of low-incomecountries  particularly in Africa  depends upon a moreopen  equitable and rules-based multilateral tradingsystem  as trade constitutes an engine for growth anddevelopment. In that regard  we view partnershipagreements such as the Cotonou Agreement and theAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act as importantsteps towards fulfilling some of the developmentobjectives. We strongly believe that the completion ofthe Doha round by 2006 will help to establish aninternational trading system consistent withdevelopment goals and policies.While developing countries are striving tofinance the MDGs  debt servicing has been divertingsignificant amounts of their limited resources  at thecost of social and economic development. In thatcontext  we reiterate the calls for more radical actionby the international community  in line withrecommendations that debt relief should covermultilateral and bilateral debt and reduce debt stockand debt servicing by up to 100 per cent. To that end we support the continuation of the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Debt Initiative and other reliefmeasures  particularly those addressing the specialneeds of African countries.In that regard  we commend the debt-cancellationdecision made by the ministers for finance of theGroup of Eight (G-8) in favour of 18 developingcountries  including Mozambique. We encourage theG-8 and other development partners to continue withsuch important initiatives and to address theunsustainable debt burden of many developingcountries  so that new resources can be invested inpursuit of poverty reduction.The Government of the Republic of Mozambiqueis now fully engaged in the implementation of itsprogramme for 2005-2009 that incorporates our visionof development based on continuity and renewal. Thatapproach is founded on past experiences andprogrammes pursued in the quest for development andthe well-being of all Mozambicans. The eradication ofpoverty requires new dynamism and vigour  as clearlypointed out in the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD)  the Brussels Programme ofAction for the Least Developed Countries and theMillennium Development Goals. In that context  ourfive-year programme focuses on integrated ruraldevelopment and the expansion of basic economic andsocial infrastructure  with the aim of reducing absolutepoverty through the promotion of rapid  comprehensiveand sustained economic growth and job creation. Inaddressing social and economic development  theprogramme seeks mainly to reduce regional imbalancesand to expand the supply of basic services such ashealth  education and access to electricity and safedrinking water. The programme also gives dueattention to the fight against HIV/AIDS  malaria andother infectious diseases  as well as to the specialneeds of young people in terms of training employment and housing.Through the implementation of sound politicaland macroeconomic policies and strategies fordevelopment  we have registered economic growthrates that have averaged 7.5 per cent annually from2000 to 2005. Poverty levels have declinedsignificantly  from 69.5 per cent in 1997 to 54 per centin 2003. That has been possible due to our focus on ournationally owned poverty eradication strategy. Thatstrategy has not only mainstreamed the MDGs andadapted them to our own realities; it also embodies aclear pro-poor and people-centred developmentstrategy.The consolidation of peace  democracy andnational unity continue to be high on our national26agenda  as we recognize that peace and stability aresine qua nons for securing sustainable development inour country.We continue to build self-confidence aroundAfrica. The continent counts on NEPAD to raise thespirit of ownership of African leaders  and thus bringabout significant changes in our development. Theadherence to date of 28 countries to the African PeerReview Mechanism has bolstered the credibility ofparticipating States  as it ensures that their policies andpractices comply with agreed political  economic andcorporate-governance values  codes and standards.We are seeing good examples of conflictresolution in Africa. However  conflicts continue tocause unbearable human suffering  which deprives alarge number of our fellow Africans of theirinalienable right to live in dignity. We commend theefforts of the Secretary-General and the internationalcommunity at large to address both humanitarian crisesand the root causes of conflict in Africa.With regard to Western Sahara  we urge theparties concerned to work together with the Secretary-General with a view to finding a political solution tothe long-standing conflict in that country.We are following with keen interest the latestdevelopments in the Middle East. We continue tobelieve that a lasting solution to the question ofPalestine ó the core of the conflict in the region ómust be in accordance with international law andrelevant United Nations resolutions and must fullyrecognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.We welcome the decision to conclude acomprehensive convention on terrorism not later thanJune 2006  for that will constitute a further effort tostrengthen the international community's resolve toface the challenge of eliminating the scourge ofterrorism. Similarly  we would like to stress theimportance of regional agreements and declarations tocombat and eliminate terrorism in all its forms as a toolto strengthen cooperation among Member States andprovide a platform for the effective implementation ofinternational legal instruments to suppress terrorism.We support the calls for a transparent verificationmechanism that can help to prevent the use of nuclearweapons against non-nuclear States. In that regard  wealso share the view that all States parties to the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  withoutdiscrimination and while undertaking theirresponsibilities for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  should have the right to use nuclearenergy for peaceful purposes  as well as to engage inresearch on nuclear technology in conformity with theprovisions of the Treaty.We would like to conclude by reaffirming thecommitment of Mozambique to the principles andpurposes enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations  as well as our belief that the United Nationsreform process will strengthen the Organization with aview to providing more and better assistance to allMember States  in particular with respect to addressingthe special needs of Africa."
"115",4867,"MRT",60,2005,"Onbehalf of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  I ampleased to extend to Mr. Eliasson my wholeheartedcongratulations on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its sixtieth session. We areconvinced that his wealth of experience and immensetalent will allow him to address the international andregional issues on our agenda with confidence andensure the success of this session  which coincides withthe sixtieth anniversary of our Organization.I cannot fail to seize this opportunity to paytribute to his predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  Minister forForeign Affairs of Gabon  for his gifted and patientperformance at the helm of the General Assembly atthe fifty-ninth session and for his tireless efforts toestablish the appropriate conditions for the holding ofthe session and the High-level Plenary Meeting thatpreceded it.I should also like warmly to congratulateSecretary-General Kofi Annan and his colleagues ontheir intense and consistent mediation and efforts toensure the convening of this session and theachievement of the Organization’s lofty objectives.I also hail the major efforts made during theintersessional period at the high-level dialogue begunin New York in late June on financing for developmentand at the Economic and Social Council session onnational achievements and steps towards the attainmentof the Millennium Development Goals and toimplement the outcomes of the internationalconferences held from 1992 to 2002.Attaining the objectives of development  securityand stability hinges on how effectively we deal withthe issues of violence and terrorism. The global natureof the phenomenon of terrorism requires that thequestion be dealt with in a global manner  through thecomplementarity of the cultures of nations and arejection of confrontation and conflict. It is alsoimportant not to forget the considerable growth gapthat exists between poor and rich countries  particularlysince the social  scientific and technical lag is one ofthe major causes of tension and one that nurturesterrorism and violence in the world. In Mauritania  wecondemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and we view it as a phenomenon that is alien to oursociety and our Islamic values of tolerance. We rejectviolence and extremism and call for mutualunderstanding  dialogue and tolerance.It is clear that we must quickly begin a politicaldialogue  which is the only means to end the conflict inthe Middle East and to restore calm there. In thiscontext  my country believes that the Israeliwithdrawal from Gaza and a few cities of the WestBank constitutes an important step towards theimplementation of the road map and the Arab peaceinitiatives. Through those initiatives Arab States haveproposed to Israel a comprehensive peace and normalrelations in exchange for total withdrawal from allPalestinian territories and from Syrian and Lebaneseterritories  a return to the 4 June 1967 borders  theestablishment of a Palestinian State with EastJerusalem as its capital  and a negotiated  justsettlement of the problem of Palestinian refugees.We are following with interest the developmentsof the situation in Iraq and are anxious to preserveIraq’s territorial unity  the unity of its people  itssovereignty  independence and non-interference in itsinternal problems  in order to overcome the problemsand ensure security  stability and the re-construction ofthe State  while supporting the transitionalGovernment.We are following with equal interest thedevelopment of the situation in the Sudan  and we giveour blessing to the Agreement between theGovernment of Sudan and the Sudanese People’sLiberation Army. We support the commendable effortsof the Sudanese Government  in coordination with theAfrican Union  the Arab League and the UnitedNations  to tackle humanitarian  security and politicalquestions related to the Darfur crisis.Regarding Western Sahara  Mauritania supportsthe efforts of the United Nations and its Secretary-General to find a definitive solution to assure stabilityin the region  a solution that has the support of allparties.Mauritania today is on the eve of an era thatbegan with an initiative taken by the Military Councilfor Justice and Democracy on 3 August 2005  whichwas hailed by the entire Mauritanian people. It put anend to totalitarian practices that caused suffering andled to dangerous derailments that threatened the futureof the country over the last two decades. This initiativerests on the commitment of the Council to theMauritanian people to create the right conditions forthe emergence of an honest and transparent democracyand to allow civil society and all legal political actors10to participate in this endeavour with full freedom. TheMilitary Council will not exercise its powers beyondthe period necessary to prepare for and set up genuinedemocratic institutions  and that period will not extendbeyond two years. The Military Council for Justice andDemocracy solemnly reaffirms respect for all ofMauritania’s international commitments and instruments.In crystallizing this initiative  the MilitaryCouncil for Justice and Democracy has defined thepriorities of the transitional Government. It hasestablished three ministerial committees entrusted withthe task of defining the modalities to guarantee properelections  working together with political parties andcivil society organizations to establish an equitablelegal system  in consultation with the national barassociation. The aim of these efforts is to propose allmeasures necessary for the emergence of a genuinesystem of good governance  in which the private sectorand civil society participate.In order to ensure justice and nationalreconciliation and to enable all people to participatefreely and actively in political life  a comprehensiveand absolute amnesty was proclaimed on 2 September2005 for all Mauritanians condemned for politicalcrimes and misdemeanours. At this point in time  noMauritanian is being prosecuted for any political crimedomestically or abroad.For the first time  the mass media are open to allpolitical parties and civil society institutions. Aconstitutional law was enacted prohibiting thePresident and members of the Military Council forJustice and Democracy  the Prime Minister andmembers of the Transitional Government fromstanding in the forthcoming elections or supporting anypolitical candidate or party. An independent electionscommittee was formed to supervise elections  seekinghelp from any nation willing to help. It is in thiscontext that Mauritania presented a memorandum tothe United Nations regarding provision of assistance tointernational observers invited by the MauritanianGovernment to provide technical and logisticalassistance for the elections. This is with a view toconducting a constitutional referendum  which will beorganized by July 2006 at the latest  as well aslegislative and presidential elections to be held before6 August 2007. The referendums and elections wouldbe held in accordance with the commitment made bythe Military Council for Justice and Democracy withthe Transitional Government  in order to provide theappropriate conditions for a transparent and opendemocracy and to facilitate the establishment ofinstitutions that will be truly representative anddiverse.Mauritania is eager to contribute to thedevelopment of cooperation and solidarity in theregional context. It is in that context that we would liketo reaffirm our total support for the Arab Maghreb which remains an incontrovertible strategic choice andan ambitious project for the people of the region intheir aspirations to greater complementarity andsolidarity.With regard to the African continent  we wouldlike to reiterate the importance we attach to ourfriendship and brotherly relations with all countries ofthe continent. We would like to further strengthencultural dialogue  communications and relations  whichwe have pledged to do within the Five-plus-Fiveframework and the Barcelona process  the tenthanniversary of which we shall celebrate this year.Given ongoing world changes  we would like tosee the role and functions of the General Assemblyenhanced and to see its decisions implemented. Thatholds true for other organs of the United Nations  inparticular the Economic and Social Council.The Security Council needs to be strengthened and to be made more representative by includingmembers from Africa  Latin America and other regionalgroups  such as the Arab Group  as well as otherindustrialized States such as Germany and Japan. Finally the working methods of the Council and its performanceneed to be improved so that it can achieve its mandateof maintaining international peace and security."
"116",4913,"MUS",60,2005,"I should like  onbehalf of my delegation and of the Government and thepeople of the Republic of Mauritius  to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixtieth session. We are confident thatyou will be able to discharge the responsibilitiesentrusted to you. I want to assure you  as I did duringour meeting this morning  of my delegation’s fullestcooperation during your tenure of office.I would also like to convey my delegation’sgratitude and appreciation to Mr. Jean Ping of Gabonfor the outstanding manner in which he conducted theaffairs of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession. As Africans  we are proud of his exemplarystewardship.My delegation also wishes to express itsappreciation for the tireless and dedicated efforts of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  in leading theOrganization in these challenging times.The very first words of the United NationsCharter — “We the peoples of the United Nations” —are of overwhelming significance. They imply thatpeople should be the primary beneficiaries of everyresolution that we adopt and every programme that welaunch. As we engage in this debate  we should askourselves whether we have  indeed  put the peoples atthe centre of all of our deliberations and activities.Have we done enough to ensure that ordinary people men and women  young and old  benefit from all ourinitiatives and actions  collective as well as individual?Last Friday  by adopting the outcome document leaders of the world renewed their pledge to savehumanity from the scourge of war  fear  disease  famineand poverty. The citizens of the world were witness tothe sober promises we made in it. They now wait  inearnest  to see concrete results. We are thereforerequired to muster the collective political will tomobilize the necessary resources to fulfil thosepledges.The wealthy and powerful North should assist theless fortunate countries  which require assistance tohelp propel them into the orbit of irreversiblesustainable social and economic growth. For its part the South must devote energy and show creativity as itengages in a common effort to attain socialdevelopment and human security.The spirit of teamwork and partnership whichresulted in the successful outcome of the UnitedNations world summit should allow us to adopt a freshmindset that places the interests  security and welfareof our peoples at the centre of our socio-economicpolicies. That cannot be done without promotinghuman rights and fundamental freedoms.In our efforts to pursue people-centreddevelopment  we must put a premium on tackling thosenational and transnational issues that have a directimpact on people’s welfare. Lifting peoples out ofabject poverty and endowing them with appropriatemeans to lead productive lives is the best guarantee forlong-term sustained social stability  which  in turn  willensure prosperity and international peace. Povertyreduction and eradication must therefore remain at thecore of all development efforts towards a just andequitable order.In keeping with our democratic tradition  justthree months ago  the people of my country voted overwhelmingly  for a change of Government.Immediately upon assuming office  my Governmenthas formulated development strategies based on thepremise that economic and social policies mustsubserve the primacy of the people  in particular thepoor. In fact  the fundamental principle of myGovernment’s policy is putting the people first. MyGovernment believes that the fullest possibleparticipation of the people in the development processis the best guarantee for the success of any growthstrategy.The first set of social decisions taken by myGovernment  with that in mind  has been to expand thewelfare State to cover free transportation for studentsand the elderly as well as to restore old-age pensionsfor all citizens. My Government's overriding objectiveis ultimately to make the economy work for the people not to make the people work for the economy.My delegation believes that assisting developingcountries through increased official developmentassistance (ODA) is crucial; but it is only a palliative not a remedy. Aid without trade would be not onlyunsustainable but  indeed  self-defeating. Trade is  andwill always remain  the recognized engine of economicgrowth and development. Developing countriescontinue to face impediments in their efforts to attainsustained economic growth. Tariff and non-tariffbarriers in developed countries  combined with the10non-implementation of commitments undertaken withrespect to development financing and debt alleviationfor developing countries  further aggravate thesituation. We call on the international community todemonstrate the political will necessary to ensure thatthe Doha development round truly takes into accountthose concerns so as to achieve a fair and equitableglobal trading system for the benefits of our people.My delegation welcomes the particular attentiongiven by the world summit to the special needs ofAfrica. While many countries throughout the worldhave made significant progress in lifting their peopleout of poverty  for many others — mainly insub-Saharan Africa — poverty  hunger  illiteracy infectious diseases and the incidence of HIV/AIDS unemployment and environmental degradationcontinue to take a heavy toll. My delegation thereforeappreciates the resolve of the international communityto address those issues and emphasizes the need fortimely implementation of the relevant measures.Despite significant efforts that have resulted inpeace in several parts of Africa  the continentcontinues to suffer from violent conflicts andhumanitarian crises. The plight of displaced people —especially women and children — in those conflictsituations and in refugee camps needs to be urgentlyaddressed. My delegation wishes to underscore theimportance of enhanced measures to protect vulnerablegroups  especially women and children  during andafter armed conflicts.In our own region  Mauritius continues to remainactively engaged in the reconciliation process in theComoros. We are presently coordinating thepreparations to host a donor round table for theComoros later this year. The importance of the meetingcannot be overstated. We urge the donor community tocontribute to this process for the benefit of the peopleof the Comoros.The situation in the Middle East is seeing sometangible progress. We welcome the process of Israelidisengagement from Gaza and the northern West Bank and we commend the efforts of the President of thePalestinian Authority  Mahmoud Abbas  to find apeaceful and lasting solution to the conflict. We urgeboth the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples to continuethe much-needed confidence-building measures so asto achieve a just and lasting peace.With regard to Iraq  where innocent civilians arefalling victim to violence on a daily basis  it isimperative that necessary support be provided toensure the creation of an environment in which theIraqi people can live in peace and security.I spoke extensively on terrorism in the statementI made on 15 September 2005 during the High-levelPlenary Meeting. I wish to reaffirm my country'scommitment to fully cooperate with the internationalcommunity to fight the scourge of terrorism  which hasa direct and indirect effect on the lives of ordinary andinnocent people.At a time when there is a global consensusregarding the need to build a more secure world  it is amatter of the greatest regret that the 2005 ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons failed toachieve a conclusive outcome. The proliferation ofnuclear weapons poses a grave risk of fissile materialfalling into the wrong hands. That eventuality is toohorrendous to contemplate. The devastation that couldbe caused by so-called low-yield nuclear weapons isunimaginable.Mauritius advocates the eventual completeelimination of all nuclear weapons on the basis of acomprehensive and non-discriminatory disarmamentregime. To demonstrate once again its full commitmentto non-proliferation and to international peace andsecurity  Mauritius recently signed the AdditionalProtocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency.Mauritius welcomes the agreement reached inJune 2005 in New York on a politically bindinginternational instrument on the tracing of small armsand light weapons  which will no doubt assist incombating the illicit trade in such weapons. Thatrepresents a significant step in ensuring that ourpeoples live in a safer world.As regards reform of the Security Council  I wishto refer to my statement on 15 September 2005outlining the position of Mauritius on that issue. Wehave a unique opportunity for substantial reform; itmust not be squandered. It is imperative that Africaand India  the world's largest democracies  should findtheir rightful place in such reform. A reformed SecurityCouncil should reflect the present geopolitical realitiesto meet the aspirations of all our peoples.11The United Nations is a vital forum in whichStates  large and small  wealthy and less fortunate  canhave their voices heard. It also provides a frameworkfor collective action on the basis of consensuspartnership and mutual understanding. I wish toreiterate the appeal I made  as Chair of the Alliance ofSmall Island States  to our friends and partners at thespecial session on financing for development tocontinue to assist the small island developing States intheir sustainable development efforts through theproper and effective implementation of the MauritiusStrategy.Regional cooperation is an important means fordeveloping and strengthening the economies ofdeveloping countries. To that end  we have mademodest but encouraging progress with respect toregional integration. Mauritius pursues an active policyof integration through subregional organizations suchas the Southern African Development Community  theCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa  theIndian Ocean Commission and the Indian Ocean Rim-Association for Regional Cooperation. While relationswith our traditional development and trade partnerscontinue to feature prominently in the foreign policy ofMauritius  we intend to take vigorous steps towards thedevelopment of strategic partnerships with memberStates of the South Asian Association for RegionalCooperation and of the Association of Southeast AsianNations  as well as with Latin American countries.Allow me to reiterate before the Assembly ourlegitimate sovereignty claim over the ChagosArchipelago  including the island of Diego Garcia which was detached by the United Kingdom from theterritory of Mauritius prior to our independence  inviolation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of1960 and resolution 2066 (XX)  of 1965. The people ofthe Chagos Archipelago  who were evicted from theislands  are still struggling for their right to return totheir birthplace. We reiterate our call to the UnitedKingdom to pursue discussions with us for an earlysettlement of this issue. Likewise  we  appeal to theFrench Government to expedite the process ofresolving the issue of the sovereignty of Tromelinthrough dialogue in the spirit of friendship and trustthat has always characterized our relationship.(spoke in French)Here  I should like to say a few words in Frenchto show my country’s attachment to and respect forcultures and languages in all their diversity. Some ofthose languages  including French  have beenbequeathed to us by history.People have struggled throughout history to livebetter  but humankind continues to suffer. That remainstrue  unfortunately  for the developing countries  andthose of the African continent in particular. The dawnof the third millennium has seen the expansion ofassistance projects  including the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  to improve the fate of the weakand impoverished. We are committed to reducingextreme poverty and hunger by 2015.The International Organization of laFrancophonie  as announced in November 2004 at itstenth summit in Ouagadougou  is involved in thatglobal struggle. We need to reinvent ourselves  get offthe beaten track  and find new ways to attain ourobjectives as soon as possible. In that respect  wewelcome the contribution of the French-speakingfamily in that joint action.(spoke in English)From this very rostrum 37 years ago  whenMauritius acceded to United Nations membership in1968  Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam  then PrimeMinister and father of the Mauritian nation  firmlyadvocated a secure  stable and just world:“[M]en of goodwill are constantly trying to find aformula by which the underprivileged can banishinequality and fear and aspire to a place in thesun.” (A/PV.1643  para. 100)Today  those aspirations are more valid than everas the comity of nations engages in the quest forfreedom from want  freedom from fear and the freedomto live in dignity. Providing mankind with thosefreedoms remains the primary goal of the UnitedNations.In that spirit  I wish to announce that myGovernment has made a commitment in the ClintonGlobal Initiative to organizing an internationalconference on poverty and development  which will beresults-oriented.Today  as we celebrate the sixtieth year of itsexistence  let us strive to become what we were alwaysmeant to be — a truly representative body of “We thepeoples of the United Nations”  acting in defence oftheir welfare and the advancement of their interests12above all else. That must remain our unflinchingobjective  and Mauritius pledges to fully play its partin that noble endeavour."
"117",4950,"MWI",60,2005,"I wish at the outset tocongratulate you on your election as President of thesixtieth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly and also for the excellent manner in whichyou and your Bureau are steering the work of thissession. I would like to assure you of my delegation’sfull support. I further commend His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  our Secretary-General  for thedynamic and sterling leadership of the United Nations.The theme of this session is germane to theproposals for reform of the Organization. There is theimperative of taking stock of its strengths and weaknessesso that we can create a better future. Within the context ofthis theme  the Secretary-General  through his reportentitled “In larger freedom”  has made importantproposals that will make the United Nations moreeffective and credible. The proposals aim at enabling theUnited Nations to provide the required leadership in theimplementation of the global development agenda andthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).My country  Malawi  has followed closely thedebate on the report. I feel that  from the diverseopinions that have been expressed  a consensus isemerging on the need to implement United Nationsreforms and make the Organization respond moreeffectively to the challenge of change.Let me  however  express the view that  inaddition to the reform of the Security Council  thereare other equally important reforms of the UnitedNations that are critical to the realization of the globaldevelopment agenda. I will turn to these later. For themoment  it is critical that we remain focused so that allelements of the reform receive our undivided attention.Mr. President  let me assure you that Malawiappreciates the role played by the internationalcommunity and the United Nations in the efforts toeradicate poverty and promote development andprosperity for all. The just-ended High-level PlenaryMeeting is one such initiative that offers great hopesfor the way forward. However  previous experience hastaught us that a lot is generally said and promisedwithin the United Nations  but little or nothing isdelivered. It is my earnest hope that the outcome ofthis session will not turn out to be another talk show.Malawi faces serious problems in instituting aneffective system of political and economic governance.2My country continues to face critical challenges indetermining our political agenda  which in turn affectour development efforts. We still face extreme poverty food shortages  hunger and malnutrition. HIV/AIDScontinues to claim more lives. Malaria is still killingmillions each year.Over and above these problems  we facemounting domestic and external debt  an unfair andinequitable global trading system and the prevalence ofconflicts and political instability. We therefore feel thatfor any United Nations reforms to be meaningful  weneed assistance in the areas of good governance.In Malawi  we are promoting good governance bypursuing sound macro-economic policies  reduction inpublic expenditure  bench-marking the activities andperformance of the civil service and fighting corruptionat all levels. We have also instituted effective reformsof the private sector  and through dialogue the businesscommunity is now responding positively to economicand social reforms. In many of these reforms  I can saythat we have made a good beginning.It is for this reason that my Governmentwelcomed the establishment of the African PeerReview Mechanism under the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) of the African Union.Our accession to the African Peer Review Mechanismis a manifestation of our desire to adopt policies andpractices that emphasize accountability andtransparency in public sector management.Malawi has made efforts to implement theMillennium Development Goals. Our report  entitled“Malawi and the Millennium Development Goals:challenges and achievements”  has been circulated.However  my country is facing severe constraints inimplementing the MDGs because we are allocating asignificant amount of limited resources to servicingexternal debt and for managing the HIV/AIDSpandemic  at the cost of the social and economictransformation necessary to fight poverty.Malawi  therefore  supports the proposal to findcomprehensive and durable solutions to the externaldebt problem. In this regard  we welcome the recentproposal by the G-8 to cancel 100 per cent ofoutstanding debt owed by 18 countries  including 14from Africa. I would like to appeal to all creditors tofollow this noble example  because debt cancellationhas the potential to assist the poor countries inachieving the MDGs and  hence  attaining nationaleconomic recovery and economic transformation.Another challenge for Malawi is that my countryfinds it hard to be integrated into the global tradingsystem  partly due to the lack of products that meethigh quality standards  but also due to an unfair andinequitable global trading system. We therefore join theappeal for the speedy completion of the World TradeOrganization Doha Round of multilateral tradenegotiations in order to assist poor countries  such asMalawi  to benefit from global trade. Furthermore there is need to provide immediate duty-free andquota-free market access for all exports from the leastdeveloped countries  including the elimination of allnon-tariff barriers  such as trade distorting subsidiesand domestic support  especially in agriculture  bydeveloped countries.In the African perspective  development effortshave also been heavily undermined by the prevalenceof conflicts and political instability in many parts ofthe continent. Realizing this  we in Africa have takenbold and far-reaching initiatives to promote peace andsecurity on the continent. For instance  my owncountry  Malawi  has participated in peacekeepingactivities in Liberia  the Sudan and the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo.I commend the role played by the United NationsSecurity Council and the G-8 in supporting the AfricanUnion’s initiatives in conflict resolution andmanagement. I also wish to draw the attention of thisAssembly to the fact that peacekeeping in Africaconstitutes the bulk of the Security Council’s work. Itherefore earnestly believe that the role of the UnitedNations in Africa can be enhanced by encouragingAfrica’s representation in the Security Council. In thatregard  Africa’s call for the expansion of the SecurityCouncil should be supported by the internationalcommunity.The HIV/AIDS pandemic poses serious socialand economic challenges to Africa. However  theGeneral Assembly may be interested to know thatMalawi is one of the few success stories in managingthe HIV/AIDS pandemic. The people of Malawi havewelcomed the provision of voluntary counselling andof free anti-retroviral drugs. For instance  since themiddle of last year  we have established more than 30anti-retroviral clinics throughout the country and havetreated many people. We expect that by this time next3year  we will have been able to treat more than 80 000people.I therefore welcome the call at the High-levelPlenary Meeting to provide  as a priority  assistance forHIV/AIDS prevention  care and treatment in Africancountries on a grant basis. I also welcome the emphasisplaced on the need to encourage pharmaceuticalcompanies to make anti-retroviral drugs affordable andaccessible in Africa. My Government appeals for morefunding to enable us to adopt a holistic approach thattakes into account the medical  economic  political andsocial impacts of HIV/AIDS on the implementation ofthe Millennium Development Goals.I take this opportunity to commend all countriesthat continue to make contributions to the Global Fundto Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Fundhas enabled Malawi to introduce free anti-retroviraltreatment programme for those infected by HIV/AIDS.In terms of agriculture and food security  Malawihas not fared well this year. My country is facingsevere food shortages owing to the drought that wehave had since January this year. As a result of a verypoor harvest  we shall require approximately 270 000metric tons to feed some 4.2 million people who willbe in need of food until the next harvest season sometime in April or May next year. I therefore appealto the world community to help us to obtain more foodsources for our people.I am grateful for the pledges of relief foodassistance made by our cooperating partners such asthe World Food Programme  the British Government the European Union  the Japanese Government  theUnited States Government  the Belgian Governmentand the Norwegian Government. We are also gratefulto the Secretary-General for the special appeal he hasmade for Southern Africa.I am pleased to announce that the people ofMalawi are also doing something to feed themselves.We have made provision in our budget to buy food forour people. We have also established a Feed-the-NationFund  through which people in Malawi from all walksof life are making voluntary donations to purchasefood for the poorest of the poor. The response has beenoverwhelming.With a view to a medium- to long-term solution we have adopted concrete policies aimed at reducingour dependence on rain-fed agriculture. We haveestablished a full ministry responsible for waterdevelopment and irrigation. We look forward totechnical assistance from those countries that haveexpertise in the area of irrigation.Turning to the subject of United Nations reform  Iwish to bring to the attention of the General Assemblyan important aspect of reform of the Organization concerning the determination of eligibility for UnitedNations membership. As members are aware  theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees theright of all the world’s peoples to belong to the UnitedNations and that no country should be deniedmembership in the Organization. Malawi believes thatthe United Nations was founded on the principle ofinclusivity in its membership.That is why we in Malawi call for the admissionof the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a Member of theUnited Nations. That request is made on the premisethat  following the collapse of communism in EasternEurope and in the Soviet Union  the new States thatemerged therefrom expressed their desire to becomesovereign and independent Members of the UnitedNations. They were granted membership. That was apolitical decision. In the same way  when the SocialistFederal Republic of Yugoslavia broke up into theseparate States of Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia Macedonia  Serbia and Montenegro and Slovenia  eachState was admitted into the United Nations. That alsowas a political decision. Czechoslovakia broke up intothe Czech Republic and Slovakia  and each of thoseStates was admitted into the United Nations. In South-East Asia  Singapore pulled out of the Federation ofMalaya and became a Member of the United Nations.Later  East Timor broke away from Indonesia and wasalso admitted as a Member. Those were politicaldecisions.The Government of Malawi is therefore puzzledthat the Republic of China (Taiwan)  which took asimilar political decision  is denied membership in theUnited Nations. How can the United Nations stand forequity and justice when it is denying membership tomore than 23 million people who contributesignificantly to global trade and development? Howcan the United Nations justify its denial of membershipto Taiwan when  in fact  the countries listed abovewere admitted? Why is Taiwan being discriminatedagainst in the United Nations?4Unless those questions are honestly answered observers will conclude that the United Nations isapplying a double standard. The Government ofMalawi believes that the United Nations should use thesame standard to grant membership to the Republic ofChina. I therefore appeal to the United Nations through you  Mr. President  to extend membership tothe Taiwanese people in the same way as it has donefor countries of Eastern Europe and South-East Asia.That would enable the dynamic and resourceful peopleof Taiwan to play their rightful role in global affairs industrialization  trade and development. I believe thatthe admission of the Republic of China (Taiwan) intothe United Nations would also bring credibility to theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.Long live the United Nations!"
"118",4996,"MYS",60,2005,"Malaysia  as the Chairmanof the Non-Aligned Movement and in its own name wishes to convey our congratulations to you  Sir  onyour election as the President of the General Assemblyat its sixtieth session. I am confident that  under yourable stewardship  the work of the Assembly will reacha successful conclusion. I wish to assure you of thefullest cooperation of the Non-Aligned Movement andof the Malaysian delegation.Let me also pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Jean Ping  for his dedication and for the successfulmanner in which he conducted the work of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session  which was anexceptionally challenging one. The consultations andnegotiations led to the successful adoption of the finaloutcome document at the world summit last Friday.Six decades ago  the peoples of the world including those under oppression and colonialism celebrated the creation of the United Nations. TheUnited Nations  as envisaged by its founders  was abeacon of hope for the world following the death anddestruction wrought by the Second World War.Malaysia fully and consistently subscribes to thecentrality of the United Nations and thus to themultilateral principles which have allowed theevolution of an international order predicated on rule-based interaction among States  thus creating apredictable and stable international environment.Without multilateralism  small or weak States couldnot hope for a democratic international order withinwhich they could aspire to independence  peace andstability  development and prosperity.Today  even as we meet here  multilateralism hascome under increasing threat. We believe that attemptsto unilaterally rewrite or redefine the normativeframework is a dangerous experiment. Without thestabilizing effect of such a framework  we would onlycreate uncertainty and confusion in the internationalorder.22The challenge confronting humankind in our timeis to address  comprehensively and collectively  themultifaceted threats to our survival and well-being inthe areas of peace and security  poverty anddevelopment  human rights and democracy.In that regard  the outcome document has soughtto give a fresh lease on life to multilateralism  both insubstance and in structure. As we continue ourdiscussions to reshape and redirect the Organization we must ensure that the General Assembly remains thetrue embodiment of the will of the world community.All of us must be committed to strengthening theGeneral Assembly so that it reflects the true voice ofdemocracy  transparency and accountability. At thisjuncture  let me voice Malaysia’s support for thechecklist of items to be implemented during the currentsession  as mapped out by the Secretary-General in hisaddress last Saturday. I hope that  by the time we meetagain next year  the Secretary-General’s report will beable to illustrate a marked improvement in the worldsituation  in particular towards achieving theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 andthe greater efficiency and effectiveness of theSecretariat.Driven by a common sense of purpose anddetermined political will  we must operationalize thecommitments we have undertaken at the major UnitedNations conferences and summits of recent years. Ourwords must be matched by our actions. This mustrepresent the beginning of the collective redoubling ofefforts that is necessary to secure a more peaceful andjust world. Where we had been unable to push theagenda on certain issues  we must now pursue them aspart of an ongoing process in the reform of the UnitedNations. Where efforts to reach agreement have failedaltogether  such as on the issue of disarmament andnon-proliferation  we must now focus our energies inorder to keep the issues alive until we achieveconsensus.Malaysia is disappointed by the absence of anyreference to disarmament and non-proliferation in theoutcome document. I hope that this is not construed asa loss of interest by the international community or asan indication that it has since fallen off our radar ofconcern. Our collective call for nuclear-weapon Statesto effect complete and general disarmament as well asto ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear weaponsmust not be compromised.It is indeed regrettable that the 2005 ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) earlier thisyear failed. That failure will intensify the adverserepercussions on the disarmament regime painstakingly negotiated since the end of the SecondWorld War. We must therefore  at this session  reiterateand  indeed  reaffirm the importance of the full andnon-selective implementation of the three pillars of theNon-Proliferation Treaty  namely: nucleardisarmament  nuclear non-proliferation and thepeaceful use of nuclear technology.We must also rededicate our efforts towards thetotal elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.The world spent an estimated $1 trillion on globalmilitary expenditures last year. Doubtless  much of thatwent to strengthening the military arsenals of Statesthat feel constantly under threat; yet some of that mustalso have been contributed by terrorists purchasingarms for their condemnable acts. The sale of smallarms and light weapons has wrought untold sufferingon unsuspecting peoples everywhere. The internationalcommunity must collectively call on States to divertsuch military spending to achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and to strengthening thedevelopment infrastructure. This would go far towardscreating a just and equitable order  which in turn wouldlead to a safer world.Since the adoption of the MDGs five years ago the burdens and obstacles faced by developingcountries seem to have increased  with almost noamelioration of the problems that already existed at thetime. Eight years ago  East Asia was battered by afinancial crisis  which in turn had trans-regionalrepercussions  adversely affecting the health of theglobal economy. Appeals by developing countries toreform the international financial architecture fell ondeaf ears. As a result  the international financialarchitecture continues to be vulnerable to similarcrises.Now  even as that and other equally importantproblems remain unresolved  we are faced with yetanother threat — a prolonged and sustained increase inoil prices  which  even as we speak  threatens toimperil the global economy. Continuous increases inoil prices are placing a disproportionate burden ondeveloping countries  thereby impoverishing them evenfurther. It is morally reprehensible that the poor are23expected to absorb the cost of instabilities ofproduction. In many quarters of the global community the unbridled free market in particular is viewed asrapacious and unfeeling.If the United Nations is to remain relevant to theworld at large  it must be able to discuss and decide onprecisely issues such as these  which not only have animpact on our day-to-day lives but also have long-termimplications  including for peace and security. If warsin the past were fought over ideology  conflicts in thefuture will be due to competition for markets andscarce natural resources  blurring the lines betweeneconomics  development and security. Accordingly  theUnited Nations must be prepared to address theinterrelated and cross-cutting issues that give rise tosuch conflicts.Globalization  with its myriad challenges andopportunities  has left many in the developingcountries unable to compete in an open and free-marketsystem. Following the current trajectory  theinternational economic system will continue to remainunjust  punishing the poor for being unable toinfluence  much less dictate  their destinies. Muchremains to be done to equalize the field between therich and the rest. Aid and debt cancellation  while theyare welcome and reduce the burden on developingcountries  have in the long term only limited effect. Itis trade that needs to be expanded and made more fairand equitable. We must press ahead towards auniversal  rule-based  open  non-discriminatory  fairand equitable multilateral trading system. It is widelyrecognized that trade has a multiplier effect and is ableto lift poor communities towards becoming self-sustaining ones. Trade can create competitive marketsthat benefit all.Malaysia condemns all acts  methods andpractices of terrorism. As terrorism is a globalphenomenon that transcends national boundaries fighting terrorism demands effective internationalaction in accordance with the Charter and universallyrecognized principles of international relations andinternational law.In countering terrorism  the use of conventionalmilitary force alone is insufficient. To truly address thescourge and prevent its re-emergence elsewhere overtime  we must deal with the root causes of terrorism inorder to provide a lasting solution that will deny thosecommitting such acts of violence sympathy and keepthem from gaining new recruits. While countering theiractions  we must at the same time win the hearts andminds of the people in order to ensure that our victorywill not be short-lived.No one group acting alone will be able to achievetotal success. Clearly  success requires a sense ofcommon purpose. The portrayal of any particulargrouping of peoples as fanatical terrorists led by areligion of war is  therefore  irresponsible and wouldderail any attempt at forging a common and unitedfront against terrorism. It is our collective duty torespond effectively to the legitimate grievances ofaffected communities  wherever they may be  so as toovercome their feelings of marginalization deprivation  oppression and injustice. The internationalcommunity as a whole must take a stand to stop actionsthat contribute directly or indirectly to the perpetuationof injustice  oppression or aggression.Misunderstanding and fear of “the other” must bereplaced by respect  dialogue  understanding andtolerance. In this context  we can build a universalculture that respects diversity so that goodwill andharmony can thrive.The interests and concerns of minority groupsmust not be sidelined in favour of the majority.Minorities too have rights that must be protected bytheir Government. Over time  the grievances ofminority groups over their being sidelined willnecessarily seek an outlet.There is a national as well as an internationaldimension to the issue of peaceful and cooperative co-existence. Understanding and respect betweenreligions  cultures and civilizations become necessaryprerequisites for dialogue and the avoidance ofconflicts. If Governments can succeed in instituting aculture of tolerance and moderation among people atthe domestic level  it will become easier for nationStates to cooperate in promoting tolerance andmoderation among nationalities and cultures at theinternational level. We must institute the precepts ofjustice  respect and understanding in our day-to-daydealings. This would  in turn  lead to fairness  goodwilland harmony in our relations.The ideas of good governance  democracy andaccountability to God and our peoples are notantithetical to Islam. They are clearly embodied in theKoran and the traditions of the Prophet Mohammed.For our own part in Malaysia  we believe that the24obligation to act based on religious imperatives can bedirected towards good  progress and development. Wecall this approach Islam Hadhari  literally civilizationalIslam  which is an approach towards a progressive andhumanistic civilization that is consistent with theobjective of creating a stable international world order.The approach that Malaysia has taken emphasizesthat progress  development  knowledge and goodgovernance as enshrined in the teachings of Islam  arecompatible with modernity and yet are firmly rooted inthe ethical  moral and universal values that willguarantee the future of humankind. It is an approachthat values substance over form and promotes toleranceand understanding  moderation and peace  andcertainly  enlightenment.In our preoccupation with the reform of theUnited Nations  we must not lose sight of the need toaddress and resolve  on a priority basis  one of the mostimportant outstanding issues confronting thisOrganization: the question of Palestine. While we allwelcome the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza  it should bepart of the Road Map and should be quickly followedby similar measures in the West Bank. The issue ofsettlements must not be left unresolved  including inand around Jerusalem  as well as the construction ofthe Separation Wall  which has already beenpronounced illegal by the International Court ofJustice. Such activities must cease forthwith. Theinternational community  particularly the UnitedNations  must continue to remain engaged with thisissue until the goal of an independent and sovereignState of Palestine is realized.Rich or poor  strong or weak  whatever ourreligion or belief  one fact is inescapable: we inhabitone world  our global village. Sixty years ago  thefounders of our universal Organization came togetherafter witnessing horrors hitherto unimaginable and saidthat never again could human life be so wantonlyextinguished. They also proclaimed that humankindwould forevermore work and live together in peace harmony and common respect. On this historicoccasion  my plea is that we return to those hopes andideals."
"119",5023,"NAM",60,2005,"I wish to congratulate youmost warmly  Mr. President  on your unanimouselection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits sixtieth session and to assure you of my delegationísfull support. May I also express our profoundappreciation to your distinguished predecessor Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon  for the effective leadership heprovided during the fifty-ninth session.I am most delighted and indeed honoured toaddress this Assembly for the first time as President ofthe Republic of Namibia. I stand before you with thedemocratic mandate given to me by the people ofNamibia during our presidential elections in November2004 and following my inauguration on 21 March2005.At the same occasion  we celebrated 15 years ofour national independence  which  as the Assemblywill recall  was brought about by a long and bitterstruggle waged by the people of Namibia under theleadership of the national liberation movement SWAPO  with wide international support  and thusculminating in the implementation of Security Councilresolution 435 (1978).I recall these important events in our history tounderline the fact that Namibiaís nationhood is directlylinked to the United Nations. In this regard  allow me therefore  on behalf of the Government and people ofNamibia and indeed on my own behalf to express oursincere appreciation and gratitude to the men andwomen of the United Nations family  who stood sideby side with us until final victory was achieved.As we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  it is indeed proper and fitting to reflect on theachievements and setbacks of our Organization sinceits inception. In this exercise  we must be guided by anhonest and objective analysis of events along the pathwe have travelled so far.In this connection  I would like to take thisopportunity to commend our Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  most sincerely for his tireless effortsto  strengthen the United Nations system through theproposed reforms. Indeed  the challenges we face todayrequire renewed commitment and visionary leadershipto ensure efficient and effective service delivery to allhumanity.When we address the crucial issue of the reformof the United Nations system  we must be guided bythe principles of democracy  equity  justice and fairnessfor all. At the centre of this overdue exercise must bethe compelling need to serve all our people better regardless of their race  religion or status ofdevelopment.With specific reference to the Security Council genuine democratization and reform can take placeonly when all its members are accorded the sameprivileges - including the veto power  which iscurrently enjoyed only by a few member States  whouse it for national self-interest. That creates resentmentand mistrust from those who are negatively affected bythe abuse of veto power.It is against this background that African Statesadopted the Harare Declaration in 1997  in which they20demanded that the veto power be abolished. However if the veto power is maintained  it is only logical thatnew permanent member States who join the expandedSecurity Council must of necessity be accorded thesame rights and privileges. Otherwise  such reform willbe cosmetic at best  and meaningless at worst.On this very crucial matter  Namibia fully standsby the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration as reaffirmed by the Fourth Extraordinary Summit ofthe African Union  held in Addis Ababa on 4 August2005. We collectively maintain that the Africancontinent  which has been underrepresented for solong  deserves two permanent seats with veto powerand five non-permanent seats on the Council. Thisdemand is logical  reasonable and justifiable. Wetherefore call on all regions to support Africaísposition. It is indeed only when we stand together onfirm principle that we can effect real and meaningfulchange in our only truly international Organization  theUnited Nations.Concerning the General Assembly  Namibia holdsthe strong view that that organ  which provides agenuinely democratic and representative platform forall Member States to be heard  should play a criticalrole in the entire reform process of our internationalOrganization. We are equally of the strong convictionthat the authority of the General Assembly should bereasserted  to ensure that its resolutions and decisionsare binding and enforceable.In this crucial process  our highest priority shouldbe our collective commitment to ensure sustainablesocial and economic development on a global scale. Inorder to achieve that goal  we must be guided by astrong spirit of human solidarity and a shared sense ofjustice and fairness for all.For many developing countries  implementationof the Millennium Development Goals is severelyhampered by the lack of adequate resources compounded by other challenges  including theHIV/AIDS pandemic  malaria and tuberculosis  as wellas other socio-economic difficulties. Against thatbackground  the Economic and Social Council must bestrengthened and given sufficient resources  togetherwith the United Nations agencies  in order to take thelead in implementing effective human-centred countryprogrammes.We accept the fact that Governments indeveloping countries have a responsibility to worktogether and to encourage the active participation ofthe private sector  civil society and other stakeholdersin bringing about sustainable social and economicdevelopment for all segments of our society.It is equally important that Governments andinstitutions in the economically advanced countriesoffer genuine partnership by providing new andadditional resources  commensurate with theircommitments in line with the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. To that end  if the countries regarded as low-middle-income countries are to meet the MillenniumDevelopment Goals by 2015  they will requireincreased support from the international community including market access as well as access to financialsources such as the International DevelopmentAssociation and official development assistance.Our ability to effectively eliminate threats tointernational peace and security will depend on themanner in which we address the social and economicchallenges facing our peoples at the global level.In our review  during the 2005 summit  of theimplementation of the Millennium Development Goalsand of other decisions taken by major internationalconferences  it became clear that we still have a longway to go to honour our commitments. It is thereforeimportant that we narrow our differences and form acommon front with a common objective to better servehumanity. We should therefore make collective andeffective use of existing multilateral mechanisms especially the United Nations  in order to succeed ineliminating current and future threats.The process of decolonization has not yet beencompleted. The peoples of Palestine and of the WesternSahara continue to suffer under foreign occupation andare denied the exercise of their inalienable rights toself-determination and national independence. It is ourcollective responsibility to rectify that historicalinjustice. In that regard  we call for the immediate andunconditional establishment of an independent State ofPalestine and the full implementation of the UnitedNations settlement plan for Western Sahara.I am equally concerned at the fact that the peopleof Cuba continue to suffer from the effects of theunilateral embargo imposed on them by the UnitedStates of America. We call on the internationalcommunity to demand the unconditional lifting of thatembargo.21In conclusion  I wish to reiterate myGovernmentís hope that  when we accept our collectiveresponsibility  the United Nations can and will succeedin preserving international peace and security andtherefore guarantee equality and justice for allhumanity. We  the peoples of the United Nations  mustdo what is required to bequeath to the next generationsa better future. To that end  the Government and thepeople of Namibia pledge our total commitment."
"120",5068,"NER",60,2005,"Iam very pleased  Mr. President  on behalf of thedelegation of the Niger  to express our warmestcongratulations on your election to the presidency ofthe sixtieth session of the General Assembly. Inelecting you  we recognize your outstanding qualitiesas a diplomat and as an active player on the ground -qualities that augur well for the success of the presentsession. Rest assured  Sir  that you will have the fullsupport of my delegation. We wish you every successin accomplishing your task.To your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. JeanPing  I wish to express our appreciation and ourgratitude for the wisdom  skill and insight with whichhe guided the work of our previous session andprepared for the High-level Plenary Meeting.To Secretary-General Kofi Annan  I wish to pay awell-deserved tribute for the decisive role he hasplayed at the head of our Organization. We pledge ourunswerving support for his efforts to reform the UnitedNations system and adapt it to the concerns of today.Need we recall the historic nature of our session?It is taking place exactly 10 years after the Declarationand Platform for Action were adopted by the FourthWorld Conference on Women in Beijing and theProgramme of Action was adopted by the WorldSummit for Social Development in Copenhagen. TheSecretary-General  in his important report entitled ""Inlarger freedom: towards development  security and humanrights for all"" (A/59/2005)  made a comprehensivediagnosis of the multiform and interdependent threatsand challenges facing the world and  at the same time made interesting recommendations to deal with them.Equally historic is the outcome document (resolution60/1) of the High-level Plenary Meeting  which we justadopted. It is a source of great hope in our arduousefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.Among those threats and challenges  to which I shallrefer again presently  are terrorism  the inequalities ofthe international economic and trade system  andviolations of human rights.Terrorism continues to rage throughout the world seriously threatening international peace and security.The recent attacks in London and Sharm el-Sheikhattest eloquently to that fact. The fight against thisscourge must therefore be strengthened and carried outover the long term  but within the framework ofinternational law. In that regard  we believe it is crucialto accelerate the process of elaborating an internationalconvention to fight terrorism. Such a conventionshould define the concept clearly to avoid ambiguity.Moreover  the fight against terrorism cannot beeffective and fruitful without appropriate internationalcooperation. It is because of such cooperation - whichhas enabled us to strengthen the capacities of our defenceand security forces - that my country has recently hadconsiderable success in combating this phenomenon.Peace and security also require the adoption ofeffective measures against the proliferation of weaponsin general. Here  I welcome the initiative of theEconomic Community of West African States - whichthe Niger currently chairs - aimed at establishing alegally binding instrument: its moratorium on themanufacture  import and export of weapons. Thatapproach has led us to regret the failure at the mostrecent review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.Today  international peace and security are beingsorely tested by a steadily rising number of conflicts some of which seem to be endless quagmires becauseof their persistence and recurrence. In West Africa although some hotbeds of tension are in the process ofbeing defused - such as in Sierra Leone  Liberia andGuinea-Bissau - the subregion is still not completely20free of insecurity and instability. We hope for positivedevelopments in Cote d'Ivoire that will permit a swiftreturn to normalcy in that country  formerly a harbourof peace and prosperity.In Western Sahara  the Niger reaffirms its supportfor the Secretary-General's efforts to bring about a justand lasting settlement of the conflict in accordancewith the relevant United Nations resolutions.In Burundi  we welcome the positive outcome ofthe peace process culminating in the legislative andpresidential elections.Peace must not only be re-established andmaintained; it must also be consolidated. In that regard the Secretary-General's proposal concerning thecreation of a Peacebuilding Commission is of capitalimportance  in that it will enable many countriesemerging from conflict to break the vicious circle ofviolence and devastation.Concerning the Middle East  my country wishesto reaffirm once again that settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict necessarily depends upon therealization of the rights of the Palestinian people including the creation of an independent  sovereign andviable State. In that regard  Israel's withdrawal fromthe Gaza Strip is a positive step that  we hope  willpermit the resumption of negotiations within theframework of the road map.With regard to Jammu and Kashmir  we remainconvinced that the relevant United Nations resolutionsmust be implemented to enable the Kashmiri people toexercise their right to self-determination. That shouldfurther reduce the tensions between India and Pakistan.The Niger  a member of the contact group of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference on that issue encourages the two parties to move forward in theirtalks aimed at a definitive settlement of this problem.This year  as we assess the progress made inhonouring the commitments made at the MillenniumSummit  the outcome document of the High-levelPlenary Meeting  which we just adopted  once againemphasizes the interdependence of States andhighlights the need for increased solidarity. To thatend  solidarity and international cooperation must more than ever before  go beyond professions of faithif they are to be more effective. In any event  solidaritymust no longer be infinitely variable  as isunfortunately the case today.The Niger  recently the victim of an acute foodcrisis  would like international solidarity to berethought so that we can invest in the future byimplementing lasting solutions that will ensurepermanent food security for our people. Without arethought solidarity  many African countries  includingmine  may unfortunately never be able to achieve theMillennium Development Goals by 2015. That wouldrequire an increase in official development assistance from both a qualitative and a quantitative perspective.In that regard  we welcome the decision of thosedeveloped countries that have elaborated a timetableenabling them to achieve the set objective of 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product by 2015. Arethought solidarity would also require theestablishment of innovative financing sources thatwould not place an excessive burden on developingcountries.We welcome the recent decisions taken bypartners  particularly the Group of Eight and theEuropean Union. We urge the international communityand the United Nations to further strengthen theircooperation with the New Partnership for Africaâ€™sDevelopment and with new initiatives for Africa including the Blair Commission's InternationalFinance  Facility  President Bush's MillenniumChallenge Account and the Chirac-Lula initiative.With regard to international trade  we hope thatthe multilateral negotiations under way will lead tomutually advantageous results by 2006  as planned.However  in the interest of mutual and shareddevelopment  there must be an end to all agriculturalsubsidies on exports. In that regard  the Hong KongMinisterial Conference planned for December is acrucial event for us that  once again  should beattended with this rethought solidarity in mind particularly with regard to the poorest countries.Concerning institutional reform of the UnitedNations  my country wishes to pay tribute to the far-sightedness of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan in identifying the stakes of such reform and in makinghis interesting and important recommendations.The Niger is fully committed to the role playedby Africa in the international arena. That collectivecommitment has led us to forge a common position onUnited Nations reform  which my countrywholeheartedly supports. In fact  our continent  whoseimportance is more apparent every day  must pursue21with determination and in unity its fight for thedemocratization of international relations.The United Nations is the only world body withthe mandate of addressing issues of security development and human rights. To be equal to thatimmense and delicate mission  it must be fair representative and democratic. It must also base itsactions on multilateralism and consultation particularly within the General Assembly.The long-awaited reform of the Security Councilmust be pursued in transparency so that a renewedUnited Nations can be more democratic and morerepresentative of today's world.The Economic and Social Council  for its part must be the forum for coordinating and draftingstrategies so that the excellent opportunities created inthis increasingly globalized world will also beaccessible to the poorest countries.The establishment of a PeacebuildingCommission has filled a significant void  because itconstitutes a formerly non-existent link betweensecurity and development.We welcome the creation of the Human RightsCouncil  based on the principles of universality andnon-exclusion. These are the prerequisites forstrengthening and improving our shared House."
"121",5114,"NGA",60,2005," On behalf of theGovernment and the people of Nigeria  and in mycapacity as the current Chairman of the African Union(AU)  I would like to extend my sincerecongratulations to you  Sir  and your country  Sweden on your election as President of the sixtieth session ofthe General Assembly. I should also commend you forthe leadership you provided at the High-level PlenaryMeeting over the past three days. The theme you havechosen for this year’s general debate — “For a strongerand more effective United Nations: the follow-up andimplementation of the High-level Plenary Meeting inSeptember 2005” — is indeed most appropriate andtimely  as it encapsulates our common desire for arenewed and invigorated Organization. I assure you ofthe full support and cooperation of the Nigeriandelegation. I would also like to express appreciation toyour predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping of theRepublic of Gabon  for his leadership and dedication.I commend the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for his tenacity andleadership qualities  which sustain the role of theUnited Nations and underlie the current reform processof the United Nations system.You  Sir  have assumed the presidency of thesixtieth session at a time when the United Nations iswitnessing epoch-making historic events. The sessionhas in the last three days taken the assessment andreview of the five-year implementation of theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Besidespursuing the reform process  launched by the report ofthe Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change  entitled “A more secure world:our shared responsibility” (A/59/565)  and theSecretary-General’s own report entitled “In largerfreedom” (A/59/2005)  the session will also mark thetenth year of implementation of the Declaration andPlatform for Action of the Fourth World Conference onWomen and the Declaration and Programme of Actionof the World Summit for Social Development  held inBeijing and Copenhagen  respectively.I have no doubt  Sir  that  with your vastexperience in diplomacy and statecraft  you will pilotthe session to a successful conclusion.The United Nations continues to play a pivotalrole in the lives of all people with its vast network ofactivities. In this regard  Nigeria is firmly anchored inits belief  commitment to and support for thestrengthening of the United Nations and the protectionof its ideals  in particular  the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  prevention andprotection of human rights and fundamental freedomsand promotion of international cooperation in solvinginternational economic  social  cultural andhumanitarian problems. There remains so much to doin these areas that only a rejuvenated United Nationscan optimally respond to the challenges.11Last year  the situation in the Sudan  includingthe Darfur region  was a cause of serious concern toAfrica and indeed to the international community.However  with the combined efforts of the UnitedNations  the African Union and the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development (IGAD)  we have managedto usher in an era of hope in that country. AComprehensive Peace Agreement has been signed andimplemented on the long-drawn north-south conflict and the fifth round of inter-Sudanese peace talks onDarfur resumed in Abuja in June 2005 and is currentlyin progress. I take this opportunity to once again appealto the parties to shed their hard-line approach tonegotiation and adopt a policy of give-and-take in theinterest of posterity.The international community has demonstratedtremendous goodwill in facilitating the peace processin Darfur  and this must be sustained by the parties.Similarly  it is equally important to maintain andsustain the current level of peace between northern andsouthern Sudan. In this connection  I salute the courageof the late Mr. John Garang in leading the southernSudanese people into reaching an accord with theGovernment of the Sudan. We regret the death ofMr. John Garang and extend our heartfelt sympathy tohis family and to the Government and people of theSudan.The situation in Somalia continues to give hopeto the ability of the contending parties to resolve theirdifferences in the higher interest of their belovedcountry. The African Union will continue to play anactive role in this regard  together with the IGAD andcountries in the region to help Somalis realize theirdream of a united and peaceful country.In the West African subregion  the African Unionand the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) have continued to remain fully engagedwith efforts to find a lasting solution to the crisis inCôte d’Ivoire. In this connection  we acknowledge thevaluable support of the United Nations to the peaceprocess. We appreciate the efforts deployed byPresident Thabo Mbeki of South Africa to mediate inCôte d’Ivoire on behalf of the AU. In view of PresidentMbeki’s report of 30 August 2005 and the recentdeclaration that the elections scheduled for Octobermay not take place  it would be necessary forECOWAS  and then the AU  to revisit the situation inCôte d’Ivoire. We will do so in full consultation withthe Secretary-General and the Security Council of theUnited Nations.We commend the evolving return to democracy reconciliation  security and development in Togo  andwe appreciate the efforts of the United Nations  theEuropean Union (EU) and other development partnersin this regard. The elections in Guinea-Bissau havecome and gone. The reconciliation process that willprecede the inauguration of the newly elected Presidenthas begun. Both Togo and Guinea-Bissau will needsubstantial support to build their economies  withoutwhich their situations could deteriorate. We call on theUnited Nations and its institutions  along with theEuropean Union and other development partners  tohelp.The AU stands resolutely by its policy of notaccepting to include among its members anyGovernment that emanates from outside a Constitutionand democratic processes. That is the situation nowwith regard to Mauritania. We are of coursemaintaining a constructive dialogue and recommendingan expeditious return to democracy  including nationalreconciliation and the necessary reforms andlegislation to move the country forward.We welcome the elections in Burundi and theGovernment resulting from that election  which isbased on the newly agreed Constitution. We appreciatethe role played by all the friends of Burundi whohelped to make that happen. Like Togo and Guinea-Bissau  Burundi will need special assistance to be ableto consolidate its reconciliation and democracy.We applaud the Secretary-General’s proposalcontained in his recent report on the situation in SierraLeone. In particular  we welcome his intention to keepthe security  political  humanitarian and human rightssituation under close review. The AU is also pleasedabout the six-month extension of the mandate of theUnited Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL)and recognition of the need for a strong United Nationspresence in the country after the withdrawal ofUNAMSIL. We believe the presence of the UnitedNations system will foster confidence and guaranteestability during the critical months following itswithdrawal. We call upon the international communityto continue to extend assistance to the Government ofSierra Leone in its efforts to develop a credible effective and sustainable police force  armed forces and12judiciary  as well as rebuild damaged infrastructurenecessary to revamp economic and social activities.The peace process in Liberia is in its most criticalphase  and calls for the cooperation of all parties in thecountry. The AU is closely monitoring developmentsthere. We are optimistic that the elections scheduled fornext month will lead to a successful transition. In thatconnection  the use of propaganda to direct attention toissues unrelated to the conduct of the forthcomingpresidential elections should be avoided and resisted.It is pertinent for me to repeat here what I saidbefore on the issue of Charles Taylor  who wasencouraged to leave Liberia in order to avoid abloodbath. He was encouraged by the leaders of Africaat the level of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) and the AU to voluntarilygive up power and leave his country  in the interests ofLiberia  West Africa and Africa  and of world peaceand security. He was escorted to Nigeria by PresidentKuffor  who was the Chairman of ECOWAS at thetime  and Presidents Mbeki and Chissano  who were respectively  the outgoing and incoming Chairmen ofthe AU. We believe that the cause of peace in Liberiawill be served if Charles Taylor stays away  or is keptaway  from Liberia during the transition or early stagesof nation-rebuilding in that country following theelections.With regard to the Great Lakes region  we havetaken note of the realistic decision of the two houses ofParliament in the Democratic Republic of the Congo toextend  for a period of six months  the transition periodthat expired on 30 June 2005  in accordance with theprovisions of the Global and All Inclusive Agreement signed in Pretoria in December 2002  and in line witharticle 196 of the transitional Constitution. The AU isdetermined to continue to work with the UnitedNations to facilitate the peaceful resolution of theconflict. In that connection  we reiterate the AU’s callto all parties to the conflict in the Democratic Republicof the Congo to respect that decision. We hope that thiswill ensure that the elections provided for by theAgreement take place satisfactorily. With thecooperation of all parties concerned and the activesupport of the international community  we are hopefulfor an orderly return to normality and the restoration ofpeace and stability in the Democratic Republic of theCongo.Nigeria’s commitment to nuclear non-proliferation has never been in doubt. We have alwayssupported the view that it should involve all States.Disarmament conventions merit the support of allStates  small or large  nuclear or non-nuclear. Mydelegation regrets the failure of the 2005 ReviewConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We should not allowthe relative stability in our world to lure us into thebelief that the need for total disarmament no longerexists. Nor can we separate disarmament from non-proliferation. Through that we can achieve the goal ofthe Charter of the United Nations of saving succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war and destruction.The availability and wide circulation of smallarms and light weapons poses the greatest danger topeace and security  especially in our region. Thoseweapons have helped to prolong conflicts and toundermine stability  social peace and security. Theyhave also wreaked devastation on the economies ofaffected States. Nigeria therefore welcomes theagreement of June 2005 on an international instrumentthat would enable States to identify and trace illicitsmall arms and light weapons in a timely and reliablemanner. However  that is only a stop-gap measure.What we need is a legally binding internationalinstrument that will regulate  control and monitor theillicit trade in small arms  including their transfer tonon-State actors. By pronouncing ourselves clearly andpositively in that regard  Member States would send amessage of their resolve not to encourage or condonethe diversion of those weapons to illicit networks.Terrorism remains a great threat to peace andsecurity at the local  national and international levels.It is inimical to the rule of law  human rights democracy and freedom. It impedes sustainabledevelopment through the destabilization of States particularly emerging democracies and nations intransition. Nigeria reaffirms its conviction thatterrorism cannot be justified under any circumstance and should therefore be combated in all its forms andmanifestations. To that end  my country welcomes theadoption  on 13 April 2005  of the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of Acts of NuclearTerrorism  and commits itself to work with others tomobilize the political will necessary to ensure the earlyentry into force of a comprehensive convention onterrorism. We also welcome the Security Council13resolution against the incitement of terrorism andterrorist acts.As we embark upon a review of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs)  the challenges of hunger poverty and disease continue to override ourconscience as well as the conscience of theinternational community. It was our concern regardingthose challenges that compelled African leaders tocommit themselves to the ideals of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  whoseprincipal objective was to encourage good governance democracy  the rule of law  security  stability andmacro-economic reforms  among other things. Fouryears on  NEPAD has made some modest progress thatreflects our determination to make Africa work forAfricans in an interdependent world and towards theachievement of sustainable development.However  notwithstanding our efforts  povertyremains endemic in Africa. The dangerous correlationbetween grinding poverty and alienation fromgovernment as a veritable source of political instabilityon the continent leaves much to be desired. We are however  grateful for the renewed commitment of ourdevelopment partners to redeem their ODA pledges increase foreign direct investment  remodel tradingarchitecture and provide better and effective technicaland structural support to our efforts. We have alsobegun to emphasize well-managed and development-focused tourism as a veritable source of wealth and jobcreation and an effective contributor to several of theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).We remain committed to providing the necessaryconducive environment that will encourage investmentand generate wealth and liberate our peoples frompoverty. Our agricultural policies and practices aretailored to expansion capable of feeding our people exporting some of the produce and providing rawmaterials for our industries.The pivotal role of trade as a veritable engine foreconomic growth cannot be overstated. Access tomarkets of developed countries  withdrawal ofagricultural subsidies as well as elimination ofdistorting tariffs are measures that should be addresseddecisively by our industrialized development partnersto enhance the ability of developing countries tobenefit from trade. The successful completion of theDoha multilateral trade negotiations would be a litmustest of our resolve.I wish to recognize the statesmanship displayedby members of the Paris Club  which recently grantedAfrican countries  among others  debt cancellation anddebt relief. We urge the international community toadopt an effective  comprehensive  durable anddevelopment-oriented solution to the debt problem ofdeveloping countries  which has become for them a cogin the wheel of development  growth and progress.Since 1986  the HIV/AIDS epidemic has rapidlygrown into a monster all over the world. In tackling thescourge  many African countries  including Nigeria have adopted the multisectoral response strategyrecommended by the United Nations.Nigeria has followed with great interest andparticipated actively in the various proposals on thereform of our Organization  the United Nations. Westrongly support the proposal for the establishment of aPeacebuilding Commission  since this will go a longway in filling a yawning gap in the consolidation ofsustainable peace and security in post-conflictcountries  particularly in Africa.We also support the proposed Human RightsCouncil. However  we do not believe that the mereexchange of the Commission on Human Rights for theproposed Council would address perceived deficienciesin the promotion and protection of human rights andfundamental freedoms  unless the proposed Counciladopts a new culture of treating all cases of violationwith a standard yardstick capable of attracting widesupport and generating confidence.As far as the proposal for the expansion of theSecurity Council is concerned  Nigeria has consistentlysupported  and as a member of the African UnionFollow-up Mechanism remains faithful to  theimplementation of the Ezulwini Consensus. We havedone so without any second thought or nationalcolourations with the sole aim of achieving the best forAfrica in the obligatory negotiations with other regionsand Members of the United Nations  whose supportAfrica must necessarily attract to achieve itsfundamental requirement of increasing the number andquality of its membership on the Security Council.Finally  as Chairman of the African Union for thepast year  I have had the privilege of working closelywith brother African heads of State or Government intransforming the African Union into a truly potent andeffective organization for the development of Africanpeoples. Through our collective efforts  we have14brought hope and confidence to Africa. We do not under any circumstances  intend to waver in thisrenewed commitment of repositioning Africa for peace security  stability  growth  sustainable development andenduring democracy. I am optimistic that with theinvaluable cooperation of the United Nations  ourdevelopment partners and the international communitywith respect to the MDGs and other NEPAD initiatives the African Union will successfully pursue the nobleobjectives enshrined in its Constitutive Act."
"122",5159,"NIC",60,2005,"The struggle for democracy being waged byNicaragua has transcended our borders  arousingfeelings of solidarity and support in different parts ofthe world. The Nicaraguan people raised their voiceand they were heard by Central America. From there with the added strength of the seven fraternal countriesthat joined it  that voice resounded throughout theAndean Community  Mexico  the United States ofAmerica  Canada  the Rio Group  the Organization ofAmerican States (OAS)  the European Union andJapan  to mention only the most recent cases. Indeed the echo of that voice has reverberated at the UnitedNations in various reports and resolutions.From this rostrum in the General Assembly Hall I would like to convey to Member States the deepgratitude of the Nicaraguan people for the solidaritythey have shown to us.We come to the sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly at a turning point for our future  for we arein the throes of a struggle for democracy  a struggle tokeep us from returning to our dark days and make thema thing of the past. Like the peoples of other UnitedNations Members who have fought for their freedom thousands of Nicaraguans have died for it  victims of aperverse pendulum that swung from authoritarianism tototalitarianism. The lessons learned in those years leftus a legacy that acknowledges the supreme value offreedom  democracy and  above all  peace.Over the past four years  we have been strivingfor national revitalization and institutional overhaulbased on transparency  freedom  the rule of law  socialequality and individual initiative.To carry out that Herculean task  we needed toovercome the errors of the past. That is why  withsupport from the rest of our continent  we haveengaged in a frontal attack on corruption and impunity.We have also attempted to restore independence andintegrity to our institutions  held hostage by private andpartisan interests. Those efforts include the legal34sphere  where the absolute impartiality and objectivityof judges and magistrates  as well as an inclusiveelectoral system capable of ensuring respect for apopular vote cast in freedom  are imperative. It alsorequires that institutions act in the service of the higherinterests of the nation and do not become weapons inpolitical vendettas  used in campaigns to intimidatepublic officials in the executive branch.The forces conniving to oppose democracyresponded by escalating the breakdown in theconstitutional order and the legitimate exercise ofpower. They then attempted to upset the balance ofpower  an essential principal of representativedemocracy in the inter-American system. Theopposition attempted to execute a new type of coupd’état  corrupting State institutions by using them asinstruments of political coercion. Instead of acceptingthe separation of powers  they appropriated thedistribution of power  attempting to modify the powersof the President retroactively without consulting theNicaraguan people. Only the Nicaraguan people canconfer national sovereignty and presidential power  asthey did at the polls in November 2001.In the light of those threats to democracy  wehave harnessed all our available resources undernational legislation and international law. The CentralAmerican Court of Justice  the judicial arm of theCentral American Integration System and rooted indemocratic values  handed down a far-reachingdecision on 29 March 2005 recognizing the separationof powers as a democratic principle. Under the Inter-American Democratic Charter  we also turned to theOrganization of American States  which affirmed thatthe disturbing turn of events in Nicaragua wascompromising the balance of power and theGovernment’s legitimate exercise of power.To overcome that situation  President EnriqueBolaños has expressed his continuing willingness tolaunch a broad national dialogue with all sectors. Thisdoes not mean  however — as the forces attempting todestroy our institutions have claimed — a dialogueaimed at surrendering democracy. Nor should it be adialogue in which a gun is held to the President’s headto force him to make concessions that would lead to anew type of dictatorship in Nicaragua — one neverbefore seen in the history of Latin America — one thatwould bring back the trials and tribulations of earlieryears and put an end to freedom and dash thedemocratic hopes of the Nicaraguan people and allnations. On the contrary  as the Organization ofAmerican States itself has said in its resolutions  it is adialogue aimed at seeking democratic solutions  freefrom pressure  threats and coercion  and aimed at thecessation of any actions that could exacerbate the crisisand prevent the restoration of the balance of power.We deplore the murder of journalists in any partof the world. In particular  we are concerned by themurders of three Nicaraguan journalists that took placeover the past three years. We are concerned not onlybecause the criminals cut short precious human lives but also because the murders came at the height of theelectoral campaign and constituted an attempt toterrorize our journalists and suppress freedom ofexpression in our young democracy. By attackingfreedom of expression  they are harming thedemocratic processes. Those forces are well aware thatfreedom of expression is the voice of democracy.Freedom of expression protects all the otherfundamental rights; without it  freedom loses itssustenance and democracy is orphaned.We will continue doing our utmost to punish theguilty and break up all networks of terror andintimidation.We are aware of the importance of the upcomingelectoral processes for democracy in Nicaragua. Underthe present circumstances  we must guarantee theNicaraguan people that every vote will be dulyregistered  counted and respected  and that their sacredright to elect their authorities in conditions of absolutefreedom will not be violated. As a result  we haveasked the Secretary-General for technical assistancefrom the United Nations specialized agencies to helpus hold elections and strengthen our democracy complementing the work being carried out by theOrganization of American States with assistance of theEuropean Union.Despite the energy  resources and efforts divertedfrom development in order to preserve democracy Nicaragua has made major strides towards fulfilling theMillennium Development Goals. Destabilizing actionshave not stopped the Nicaraguan people frombeginning to enjoy the first fruits of the war againstcorruption and to benefit from an honest andtransparent civil service that has succeeded inattracting foreign investment and winning theconfidence of the international community.35The latest gauge of President Bolaños’s successin enabling more and more Nicaraguans to lead adecent life can be found in the Human DevelopmentReport 2005  which states that we have progressedfrom the 118th to the 112th position. The best medium-term strategy for sustainable poverty reduction is togain access to new markets and make internationaltrade the driving force of growth  combining economicgrowth with social development in order to develop ourhuman capital.The Government of Nicaragua is promotingratification of the Central American Free TradeAgreement between Central America  the DominicanRepublic and the United States of America  whichseeks to strengthen our economy  integrate us into theworld and raise our population’s standard of living particularly that of the poorest sectors.We welcomed with hope the words of PresidentBush in his statement to this Assembly:“A successful Doha Round will reduce andeliminate tariffs and other barriers on farm andindustrial goods. It will end unfair agriculturalsubsidies ... Under Doha  every nation will gain —and the developing world stands to gain themost.” (A/60/PV.2  p. 8)May that be the case.I am pleased to announce that in accordance withthe request made by the heads of State and Governmentof the Central American Integration System toPresident Vicente Fox of Mexico on 12 September  weare today sending his Government the information thatwill make it possible to explore innovative financemechanisms to help our countries deal with the crisiscaused by the international price of oil.Poverty is a multi-dimensional phenomenonassociated with economic and structural problems. Thereduction of unemployment and social inequality andthe expansion of social investment are determiningfactors for human development: in other words sustainable economic growth within a democraticframework based on social and gender equality.The Government of Nicaragua is carrying outsocial programmes to protect the rights and satisfy thebasic needs of the most vulnerable sectors ofNicaraguan society — women  children  young people the elderly and persons with disabilities. Thisprotection extends to Nicaraguans abroad.We reaffirm our priority commitment topromoting respect for the dignity of all our migrants who  with their work and their efforts  contribute tosocio-economic development  that of their host countryand that of their home country.A duty of justice and solidarity moves Nicaraguato raise its voice in support of the just and legitimateaspiration of the Republic of China on Taiwan tobecome a member of the universal forum of the UnitedNations. The more than 20 million nationals of thatcountry deserve to be regarded as an integral part ofthe peoples of the United Nations.Nicaragua is grateful to the Central AmericanIntegration System for endorsing our candidacy for anon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the2006-2007 term  reflecting the right of countries withsmall economies to be represented on an equal footing.At a time of reform of the Organization  Nicaragua isalso grateful for the significant support it has receivedthus far and affirms its resolve to continue seeking thesupport of all Member States.We hope to be elected and to share our experiencein areas such as peacekeeping and peacebuilding and tosupport the just aspiration of developing countries toparticipate fully in decisions concerning security  withall the responsibility  benefits and consequences thatthat implies."
"123",5206,"NLD",60,2005,"It is my firm opinion thatwe achieved important results at our summit. Wecreated a peacebuilding commission and agreed toestablish a human rights council. We have goodlanguage on development  including unanimousagreement on the Millennium Development Goals  andwe agreed on the responsibility to protect. We madeprogress towards consensus on the fight againstterrorism and agreed on some essential managementand reform issues.Some have expressed disappointment about theresults of the summit and  indeed  not all of ourambitions were achieved. Does that imply that it iswrong to be ambitious? Of course not. In a worldsociety of 191 Member States  we must accept that theend result of negotiations will always reflect acompromise between different ambitions  and that wehave to be tolerant of each other’s diverse views andinterests.As regards my own country’s expectations  it is amatter of concern that we did not agree on anymeasures to counter the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction — one of the greatest threats tohumankind. We had also hoped for more specificagreement on the modalities for the human rightscouncil and would have preferred clear parameters forthe use of force  as well as solid language on theInternational Criminal Court. And the Netherlandswould have liked to give the Secretary-General morescope to carry out his management responsibilities.But all in all  we have made clear progress. So letus now agree to remain ambitious  to move forwardwith implementing the programme we have agreed  andto allow the United Nations to deliver on our promises.I look forward to the outline of work the President ofthis Assembly has announced  and I fully support theaccountability pact with which the Secretary-Generalhas challenged us.We have also achieved something else  somethingless apparent but equally important. We havereaffirmed our political and moral support for afundamental underlying principle  namely  that weneed to build bridges through dialogue and cooperationand that we have to promote respect and tolerance. Andwe all share the conviction that  in promoting respectand tolerance across the globe  the United Nations hasa central role to play.According to a well-known saying  there is onlyone thing we cannot tolerate  and that is intolerance.Indeed  the struggle to protect tolerance fromintolerance is one of the great challenges of our time.It is in the interest of all States to take up thefight against radical ideologies that turn people intoterrorists. Terrorism  as we all know  is a cross-borderthreat. People of all persuasions and beliefs are itsinnocent victims. And so we must respond collectively both to terrorism and to the radical ideologies that feedand breed it. Rwanda and the wars in the formerYugoslavia are sharp reminders of how the political useof intolerant and racist rhetoric can even lead togenocide or ethnic cleansing.Still  I do not believe there is or will be a clash ofcivilizations. But there is a clash between the tolerantand the intolerant within and across our societies within and across our civilizations.That is why it is now so important to take on theradical ideologies that foster violent extremism.Security Council resolution 1624 (2005)  calling on allStates to prohibit  by law  incitement to commit aterrorist act or acts  sends an important message to thehate-mongers.To fight an effective battle against violentextremism and terrorism  we must strike a carefulbalance between judicial and police measures  on theone hand  and meaningful dialogue on the other. Let uslearn from each other in that respect. I believe that peerreview in the human rights council could  in future help us all to maintain that careful balance.Let us invest in a global culture of tolerance andmutual respect. We must not look at cultural  religiousand ideological differences as unbridgeable dividesseparating adversaries. Instead  we should join forcesfor a global society in which the quest for greater unitygoes hand in hand with respect for diversity.22The best way for societies to protect tolerance isfor them to treasure their identity and  at the sametime  dare to reassess the validity of their prevailingnorms and standards. Recent events in the Netherlands for example  have confronted our society with thequestion of how to protect our centuries-old traditionof tolerance from those who would abuse it to sowhatred and division. That process of reflection is anongoing one  but part of the answer is to constantlyremind ourselves that it is wrong to hold an entirecommunity accountable for the deeds of individuals.Let us all vow to protect tolerance fromintolerance. Let us invest in mutual respect and try tochange the mindset of those who propagate intoleranceand violent extremism. That will require permanentdialogue  with a central role for the United Nations  theonly truly global platform we possess.Serious dialogue can also help to clear upmisunderstandings. One of the most strikingmisunderstandings concerns the nature of secularism by which I mean the separation of State and religiousinstitutions. That separation protects the freedom of allcitizens of all religious backgrounds  as well as ofpeople who do not practice any religion. In theNetherlands  as elsewhere  politicians and politicalparties may be inspired by religion  as long as theinstitutions remain separate.That is precisely why  in my country and acrossthe European continent  there is a place for Islam  justas there is a place for other religions. There is a placefor any form of Islam that allows believers to be bothMuslims and citizens of a democratic society.Citizenship means more than just holding apassport. True citizenship calls for an activecontribution to the society of which one is a part. Italso calls for a society that is open to the many andvaried contributions of all its citizens. Radicalideologies that push people to isolate themselves fromthe rest of society and to reject or even attack the spiritof democracy will run up against our determinedrefusal to give even one inch  in my country and  Ihope  everywhere. For intolerance is a global  cross-border phenomenon  which is why we so urgently needthe United Nations at our side.United Nations reform will mean making good onour promises. It will require determinedimplementation of the plans and proposals we haveagreed on. If we are serious about our effort to build amore humane  dignified and just world  United Nationsreform must also strengthen the protection of tolerancefrom intolerance.In our fast-changing world  people long for safetyand certainty  and that is understandable. But leadersall over the world have a duty to explain that narrowworldviews  with no place for differences  can offer nogenuine protection. Without respect for diversity  therecan be no unity.If we want to protect tolerance from intolerance we should look critically at what we teach our children.How can we expect them to become tolerant adults ifthey learn in school to despise people of other faithsand ethnicities? It is not enough for Governments to dopolite business with other Governments; they should at the same time  not allow hotbeds of intolerance toexist in their societies.There is an old saying that we reap what we sow.If we wish to reap a harvest of tolerance and mutualrespect  and foster a sense of common purpose  thenwe must set to work now. Let us begin sowing theseeds of tolerance and mutual respect here at theUnited Nations  the world’s main crossroads ofcivilizations."
"124",5251,"NOR",60,2005,"I  too  congratulate you Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixtieth session.Sixty years ago  the United Nations rose out ofthe ashes of the Second World War. The creation of ourOrganization was the fulfilment of people's hopes for abetter and safer future. Norway was honoured toprovide the United Nations with its first Secretary-General  Trygve Lie.Last week  we saw agreement on a summitoutcome document (resolution 60/1). The documentfalls short of our expectations. Still  it providesimportant direction on how to improve and strengthenthe role of the United Nations in building peace andsecurity and promoting human rights and development.In some areas  Member States made considerableprogress; in others  better results should have beenachieved. In particular  I had hoped for ó and workedfor ó a substantial text on nuclear disarmament andnon-proliferation. The proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction represents a fundamental threat.There is a growing risk of proliferation and ofcatastrophic terrorism. At the same time  we see areluctance on the part of some to accept that all Statesmust advance disarmament and non-proliferation.During the past week  I have repeatedly heard inthe General Assembly that we are willing to solvecommon problems. Yet it has not been possible toreach any consensus on how to address these trulyglobal threats. I can assure members that Norway willtake up the challenge set out by the Secretary-Generaland will continue to seek consensus and concreteresults. We will do that together with Australia  Chile Indonesia  Romania  South Africa and the UnitedKingdom and with all those countries that supportedour efforts.Further progress is also urgently needed toprevent the proliferation of small arms and lightweapons. Norway welcomes the outcome document'scall for implementation of the United NationsProgramme of Action on Small Arms and LightWeapons. We would have liked  however  to see astronger commitment to controlling internationaltransfers of such weapons through legally bindingagreements.The international community needs to cooperatein order to meet global challenges. We are faced withan array of new threats and challenges: I just spoke ofthe risk of proliferation; terrorism is another. Thespread of new and infectious diseases is also afrightening prospect. Multilateralism is the answer. Wemust face all these threats together and reachagreement on how to meet them. The global arena mustbe continually reformed and adapted to make sure thatwe have a United Nations that is in the best possibleshape. We cannot blame others if it does not function.As the Secretary-General said in his statement to the11summit  ""Whatever our differences  in ourinterdependent world  we stand or fall together""(A/60/PV.2  p. 5).Our greatest responsibility is to ensure that thestrong protect the weak. Our greatest failure is whenwe  the Members of the United Nations  are unable toprevent atrocities against innocent civilians. For thefirst time  Member States have endorsed the principleof the ìresponsibility to protectî. That creates animportant new basis for collective action in cases ofgenocide  crimes against humanity  ethnic cleansingand war crimes. We now have the tools to preventanother Srebrenica or another Rwanda.A greater consensus on collective action and earlydiplomatic response are needed to prevent violentconflicts. Addressing the needs of countries understress is a demanding challenge for the United Nations;so is assisting countries suffering from conflict and intransition from war to peace. The peace process thatNorway is facilitating between the Government of SriLanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam hasbenefited from United Nations support. TheOrganization's role in providing humanitarian anddevelopment assistance to all areas of Sri Lanka hasbeen indispensable.I therefore welcome the initiative to establish aPeacebuilding Commission to marshal resources  giveadvice and propose comprehensive strategies forpeacebuilding and post-conflict recovery. The situationin the Sudan  the Democratic Republic of the Congoand other conflict-afflicted areas clearly demonstratesthe need for a Peacebuilding Commission. As long asthe Security Council remains actively seized of amatter  the Peacebuilding Commission should provideadvice to the Council. Norway will contribute $15million to the Peacebuilding Fund. The role and theneeds of women should be duly reflected in theestablishment of a Peacebuilding Commission. TheCommission should contribute to the follow-up of thebinding commitments set out in Security Councilresolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace andsecurity.While supporting the establishment of thePeacebuilding Commission  Norway places greatemphasis on the need to maintain and strengthen theactivity of the Secretary-General to take initiativesthrough his good offices.As we convene here in New York  an estimated10 million people are facing severe food shortages inSouthern Africa. According to the Secretary-General the chronic state of emergency in the region is causedby a combination of HIV/AIDS  food insecurity and aweakened capacity for governance. During recentmonths  there has also been a severe drought in Nigerand in parts of the Sahel region.The response capacity of the United Nations is inneed of reform. That means improving the speed equity and predictability of humanitarian response. Anupgraded and expanded Central Emergency ResponseFund is an important step in the right direction; so isimproved coordination at the field level  including theHumanitarian Coordinator system. The GeneralAssembly must now take the decisions necessary forthe new Fund to become operational as early aspossible. Norway has pledged $15 million to the Fund and we stand ready to assist in putting in place thenecessary organizational framework.The United Nations is making a significantcontribution to development. The universalendorsement of the Millennium Development Goalsand the renewed commitment to achieving them by2015 are key results of the summit; so are thestrengthened commitments concerning increasedofficial development assistance (ODA) and debt reliefmade during the preparations leading up to the summit particularly by the European Union and the Group ofEight. The world community must now make sure thatpromises are followed by payments and that the focuson Africa remains strong. Norway will do its part byincreasing its ODA contributions to Africa for 2006 by$150 million.International trade is a prerequisite for economicgrowth and development. Norway is committed to thefurther development of a rule-based and fairmultilateral trading system. The ongoing World TradeOrganization negotiations are approaching a crucialcrossroads in Hong Kong in December. We mustredouble our efforts to achieve the fullest possiblerealization of the Doha work programme in order tosuccessfully complete the Doha development round in2006. Particular attention must be paid to the needs andinterests of developing countries.No cause can justify acts of terror. The UnitedNations should have a central role in leading andcoordinating the international fight against terrorism. A12broad-based strategy is necessary to counter this threat as recommended by the Secretary-General. The fightagainst terrorism must be based on the rule of law. Therole of the United Nations is essential  because it canprovide the legal instruments and frameworks we need.I encourage all States to sign  ratify and implement the13 United Nations conventions related to terrorism.Norway strongly supports the efforts to conclude acomprehensive United Nations convention oninternational terrorism.Terrorism must be fought by a broad range ofmeans  including military and legal means. Otherthreats to peace and stability must also be addressed such as poverty and unemployment  lack of social andpolitical rights  absence of the rule of law and lack ofaccess to education. The United Nations has a vital roleto play in all those areas. It has more experience onthose issues than any other organization and possessesthe most suitable tools to address them.Defending human rights is a principal universalobjective. When human rights defenders are silenced violations of human rights go unnoticed  unexposedand unopposed. The issue of individuals and groupssubject to human rights violations should be put firmlyon the agenda of all countries. I call for members'continued support for a draft resolution to that end.It is vital that we assign human rights theirrightful place as a fundamental pillar of the UnitedNations. Our goal in the coming months must be tobridge the gap between expectations for credibleUnited Nations action in the field of human rights andthe capacities of the Organization. We must take thefollowing steps.We must create a new standing human rightsbody as soon as possible  preferably as a principalorgan of the United Nations. It must focus on bothimplementation and capacity-building. It must also beable to deal swiftly with human rights violationsworldwide in a credible and effective manner. Thestrengths and best practices of the Commission onHuman Rights must be retained and its weaknesses leftbehind.And we must strengthen the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights byrespecting  in the Fifth Committee  the decision of thesummit to double the regular budget resources of theOffice.There is a need for stronger executive leadershipand thorough administrative reform of theOrganization. Corruption  mismanagement and sexualexploitation and abuse are examples of conduct thatcannot be tolerated.We have decided to make the Office of InternalOversight Services more independent. The Office'scapacity to carry out audits and investigations will besignificantly strengthened. It is necessary to furtherstrengthen the accountability of the Secretariat andimprove management performance  as well as reinforceethical conduct. Responsibility for many of theweaknesses in the United Nations system  however lies with the Member States themselves.We need a more relevant General Assembly asthe chief policymaking body of the Organization. Thatwill require strategic leadership on the part of MemberStates. The Secretary-General  as the chiefadministrative officer  must be granted sufficientauthority and flexibility to carry out his duties. In orderto strengthen the Organization's capacity to ensure thatmandates are fulfilled  we need to provide thenecessary resources. In order to maintain an efficientorganization  we need to review existing mandates andrevoke those that are no longer relevant.The management reform process provides agolden opportunity to increase the recruitment ofwomen at all levels of the United Nations. Goodgovernance in a modern organization requirescontributions from women on an equal footing withmen.Some have called the results of the summit justanother step along the way. In my view  manyimportant steps were taken. Now it is up to the GeneralAssembly to follow up. I promise that Norway will doits part. We will continue to work for reforms. TheUnited Nations system must become more effective insecuring global peace and security  combating povertyand promoting human rights. In the end  it is we  theMember States  who are responsible for making that areality."
"125",5297,"NPL",60,2005,"The recently concludedHigh-level Plenary Meeting has rekindled the hopesand aspirations of humanity for enduring peace security and development. The outcome document(resolution 60/1) is a testimony to our shared vision collective wisdom and renewed commitment to globalpartnership to address the most pressing challenges ofthe twenty-first century. The commitments to eradicatepoverty  to resolutely fight against terrorism and tobring about the timely reform of the United Nations asthe pivot of multilateralism  can be achieved andtranslated into action only by our working together.The outcome document has reaffirmed theworld’s topmost priority — combating terrorism — asthe most pressing global issue. Terrorism is not just theproblem of a few countries; it is a threat to world peaceand stability. In today’s interconnected and interlinkedworld  terrorism does not remained confined withingeographical borders. Its reverberations have been feltfar and wide. As every act of terrorism defies basichuman values  we must deal it with resolutely  firmlyand comprehensively  without double standards orselective interpretations.As a country that has been suffering fromsenseless and brutal terrorism for a decade  Nepalunequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations and supports the early conclusion of acomprehensive convention against internationalterrorism.14His Majesty the King’s commitment to multipartydemocracy is unflinching and total. His Majesty isdetermined to re-energize multiparty democraticinstitutions by restoring sustainable peace and makingdemocracy meaningful  mature  cultured and refined.To that end  we will be holding municipal elections byApril 2006  to be followed by national parliamentaryelections within two years. That will be an importantstep forward in re-energizing our democraticinstitutions through free and fair elections. I urge thecountries and organizations which support democracyto come forward and help us to conduct free and fairelections. His Majesty’s Government is ready towelcome international observers for the elections.Democracy has been sustained not only as a system ofgovernance but also as a way of life in all parts of theworld.The beauty of our planet lies in its diversity. Wereaffirm the acknowledgement in paragraph 135 of theoutcome document that  while democracies sharecommon features  there is no single model ofdemocracy. Sovereign countries and peoples must beallowed to have every right to choose the system ofdemocratic governance that is suitable to their needsand aspirations.His Majesty King Gyanendra Bir Bikram ShahDev recently stated that the use of force alone is not asolution  and that the solution rather lies in talks. Weare convinced that lasting peace can be achieved onlythrough dialogue based on trust and confidence. Butany overture must be credible and sincere enough todispel all doubts and suspicions surrounding it. This isour principled position: to work with all constitutionalforces in efforts towards establishing durable peace andstability in our country.His Majesty’s Government has initiatedprogrammes to alleviate the plight of people sufferingas a result of conflict. The Government has accordedtop priority to implementing programmes for broad-based economic growth  social inclusion  anti-corruption efforts and the speedy delivery of essentialservices to needy people. Special relief packageprogrammes are being carried in an integrated mannerto the areas hit by conflict; these include food  shelter health  education and the rehabilitation of personsinternally displaced due to terrorist violence.International peace and security can bemaintained only in an atmosphere of mutualunderstanding  trust and confidence. Nepal has alwaysstressed that the international community must makegenuine efforts for the general and completedisarmament of all weapons of mass destruction including biological  chemical  nuclear andradiological weapons  in a time-bound manner.However  the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and slow progress in global disarmamentnegotiations have weakened hopes for a safer and moresecure world.We firmly believe that regional mechanisms including the establishment of United Nations regionalcentres for peace and disarmament in various parts ofthe world  can make a significant contribution to globaldisarmament efforts by enhancing confidence-building.Our commitment is reflected in Nepal’s ardent desireto relocate the United Nations Regional Centre forPeace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific toKathmandu at the earliest possible date and tocontinuously pursue the Kathmandu process as a partof the world disarmament campaign.The role of the United Nations in peacekeeping peacemaking and post-conflict peacebuilding hasassumed great significance over the years. Nepal hasbeen continuously participating in United Nationspeacekeeping operations since 1958 and has alreadycontributed more than 50 000 peacekeepers to 29United Nations peacekeeping missions. With its currentdeployment of around 3 500 peacekeepers in 13peacekeeping missions  Nepal ranks among the top fivecountries contributing troops to the United Nationspeacekeeping missions. The sacrifice of the lives of 54Nepali peacekeepers in the service of humanity indifficult conflict zones around the world stands astestimony to their dedication to the cause of worldpeace.Nepalese Blue Helmets have earned internationalrepute for their dedication  discipline  impartiality andprofessionalism in the discharge of their duties. This isreflected in the inclusion of a Nepali peacekeeper inthe United Nations team that went to Stockholm toreceive the Nobel Peace Prize  and in the severalexcellent honours and awards that have been accordedto them  the most recent being in the Central AfricanState of Burundi. Over the years  our peacekeepershave also been involved in peacebuilding reconstruction and rehabilitation exercises in variousUnited Nations missions.15Nepal welcomes the establishment of aPeacebuilding Commission as an intergovernmentaladvisory body. This  we believe  will be instrumental toUnited Nations efforts in effecting sustained recoveryand reconstruction and will provide guidance andassistance in laying the foundation for lasting peace incountries emerging from conflict. The Commission’smission  objectives and goals should be clearlydefined; there should be equitable representation fromamong the troop-contributing countries; and theCommission should be adequately funded.Nepal is unswervingly committed to theprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charterand its contribution to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. After almost two decades  Nepal isseeking non-permanent membership of the SecurityCouncil for the period 2007-2008; we have an earnestdesire to contribute to the Council in its important rolein the maintenance of international peace and security.I take this opportunity to renew our appeal to MemberStates for their invaluable support to Nepal in theelections slated for next year.Nepal is fully committed to the protection andpromotion of human rights. We view all human rightsas universal  indivisible and interdependent. I wish toreiterate His Majesty’s Government’s commitment tothe implementation of human rights instruments andinternational humanitarian law through thestrengthening of national human rights institutions andthrough full cooperation with United Nations humanrights mechanisms. The human rights situation inNepal needs to be properly understood in the context ofthe unabated violence perpetrated by the terrorists. Thetendency to equate the constitutional duty of theGovernment to protect the lives and property ofordinary citizens with that of the dreadful acts of theterrorists needs to be corrected. The terrorists haveexceeded all norms and values by resorting to the mostheinous acts of violence  indiscriminate killings  themaiming and abduction of innocent civilians kidnapping and the forceful recruitment of children assoldiers and extortion and intimidation of the civilianpopulation.We have been providing asylum to more than100 000 Bhutanese refugees on humanitarian groundsfor a decade and a half. His Majesty’s Government hasshown its honesty and sincerity and has walked theextra mile for the solution of the refugee problemthrough a bilateral process. We strongly believe thatsincere implementation of bilateral agreements willlead to a lasting solution of the problem. We believethat a lasting solution to the refugee problem will havea salutary impact on Nepal-Bhutan relations  whichemanate from monarchical cultures.Nepal’s peace and stability have a great bearingnot only on its own people but also on its neighboursand on South Asia and beyond. A stable  peaceful andprosperous Nepal  small in size but strategicallylocated  can greatly contribute to maintainingsustainable peace  stability and prosperity in the regionand beyond.The world has seen that peace and stability in theworld community cannot be guaranteed without thepeace  stability and prosperity of smaller andvulnerable States. Therefore  the internationalcommunity must come forward to help countries withspecial needs  such as least developed and landlockeddeveloping countries  to help them achieve peace stability and prosperity. The new international financialand development architecture should  therefore address the legitimate interests and aspirations of thosecountries.We call upon the developed countries to augmentthe level of official development assistance (ODA) andto provide better market access  increased foreigndirect investment and substantial debt relief measuresto alleviate the hardships of developing countries especially the least developed and the landlocked ones.We urge the international community to come forwardwith technical assistance to meet the special needs ofthe small  landlocked and fragile States with specialchallenges emanating from terrorism and naturaldisasters.Nepal’s location between the two fastest-growingeconomies — India and China — provides us withtremendous opportunities for economic growth anddevelopment. We have proposed Nepal as a transitpoint between our two neighbours  acting as a bridgebetween them to realize their full economic potential.Nepal firmly believes that only a strengthenedand revitalized United Nations can address themultitude of challenges of the contemporary world.Timely reform and necessary restructuring of theUnited Nations  preserving and promoting thecentrality and sanctity of the principles and purposesenshrined in the Charter  are needed to make the worldbody more robust and vibrant. Nepal has always looked16to the United Nations as a torchbearer for peace security and the dignity of nations. It is also our firmview that United Nations reform should give moreemphasis to strengthening the Organization’s role inpromoting international cooperation for the economicand social development of Member States  particularlythe developing countries.Nepal has consistently supported the reform ofthe Security Council  including its method of work  tomake it more representative  transparent andaccountable  in order to reflect present-day realities.We have also maintained that the General Assembly  asthe principal deliberative organ of the United Nations needs to be further strengthened.The six-decade-long journey of the UnitedNations has been arduous and at times eventumultuous. It has seen high expectations  deepfrustration and the harsh realities of realpolitik but hasnever floundered or wavered from its noble objectives.This year marks the fiftieth year of Nepal’smembership of the United Nations. Since we joined theUnited Nations  on 14 December 1955  Nepal hascherished its association with the world body and hasplayed an active role in its activities. The Nepalipeople are proud of their association with the worldbody and are celebrating the occasion in a special waybefitting its significance. Nepal acknowledges itssincere appreciation of the United Nations and itsvarious specialized agencies for their most valuablecontribution to our socio-economic developmentendeavours.We reaffirm our solemn pledge to the Charter ofthe United Nations and renew our unwaveringcommitment to make the Organization more equitable credible and relevant to face effectively the challengesof the twenty-first century."
"126",5314,"NRU",60,2005,"The outcome document adopted at the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 60/1) serves as a map by which we navigate in seeking to improve the lives of the many peoples of the world; it may be imperfect  but it is our task as leaders to provide a vision of a better world and to lead our peoples towards the achievement of that vision. The outcome document spells out this vision  and we should use it much as one uses a map when navigating the destiny of our respective nations.   In this respect  Nauru looks to the United Nations as the global leader in reaching this vision of a better world: a world in which human rights are collectively recognized and defended  terrorism in any form is eliminated  peace and security is promoted and maintained  and poverty is eradicated. We therefore applaud the effort to strengthen the work of the United Nations through management reform. This should improve the delivery of the global services that this Organization is expected to provide.  Equally important is the need to reform the Security Council  to recognize that international developments since the establishment of that body many decades ago now demand a more democratic representation of the global family in an expanded Security Council. The earlier these reforms are implemented  the earlier the work of the United    4 05-51226  Nations can be further improved  with commensurate benefit to the people whose interests we all serve.  Nauru is in the unenviable position of having lost its earlier status as a donor country  with much of its wealth lost through mismanagement and  in particular  corrupt leadership. We therefore speak with some experience when we note with encouragement the decision by the United Nations to implement management and structural reforms to improve  amongst other things  transparency and accountability for the greater good of Member countries and the peoples we represent.   Nauru itself is undertaking significant economic and political reforms as it recommences the nation-building process. These include the design of a national development strategy  the public consultative phase of which has just been concluded; it will be presented to the donor community in November this year. We hope that the international community can participate  not by driving the development agenda for the people of Nauru  but by accepting the vision of our people as that to be implemented by Nauru with the support of its development partners. The development agenda for developing countries  particularly those with fragile and vulnerable economies  must be designed by those on whose lives that agenda will have an impact and not by external parties that have a different agenda.  We believe that the thorough consultative process within which the national development strategy is being designed is in itself an exercise in democracy. The views expressed by government and non-government agencies and by community  faith and other leaders  is testament to the strength of democracy in Nauru. To turn a blind eye to this process by driving a development agenda not envisioned by the people is not only dangerous to the development needs of the people it should serve  but a threat to democracy itself. We hope that the United Nations itself will have a leading role in assisting the rebuilding of Nauru and in achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. We reiterate our call for a United Nations presence in Nauru for this purpose.  Nauru also calls upon the developed world to match its rhetoric with action when it comes to meeting the development needs of the developing world  through development financing and/or debt relief. It is simply not good enough to be targeting the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 without making available the resources to fund that effort. The developed world has an obligation to share its resources with the developing world by ensuring it meets its own target of official development assistance expenditure of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product  and to achieve it promptly  if the developing world is to achieve the Millennium Development Goals within 10 years.  The decision not to consider the question of the people of Taiwan is a gross dereliction of duty by this Assembly. There are 23 million people on Taiwan who are being denied the right to be recognized and protected by this Organization. The United Nations has a role in assisting and facilitating constructive dialogue to ensure a future of peace for the people of Taiwan and the rest of that region. Peace and security in the Taiwan Strait is peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region. I am very hopeful that Member States will recognize and accept the appeal by the good people of Taiwan at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.   God bless the Republic of Nauru and God bless the United Nations and the peoples of the world. We shall proceed with God’s will first. "
"127",5361,"NZL",60,2005,"Sixty years ago Prime Minister Peter Fraser of New Zealand toldrepresentatives to the San Francisco Conference that itssole aim should be“the setting up of a world organization that willreally work  and that will be the background foran orderly progress towards security  prosperityand happiness for all the people of all nations”.The new organization would only work  he said  if itsmembers were determined to stand by theircommitments and principles.Today the essential concept of the United Nationsremains robust. We can be justly proud of itsachievements in many areas including humanitarianassistance  development and peacekeeping. But wehave collectively underperformed in others  sometimeswith tragic results.Our task this sixtieth anniversary is twofold: first to recommit ourselves as Member States to theenduring vision and values of the Charter and 19secondly  to retool the United Nations machinery tomeet the challenges of the twenty-first century.The Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) providesthe blueprint for the way forward. New Zealand wouldhave liked more progress in a number of areas  such asmore detailed agreement on the establishment of theHuman Rights Council and more authority to theSecretary-General to manage resources in return forgreater accountability. We deeply regret the failure toendorse further disarmament and non-proliferationmeasures.But we are encouraged by the many significantadvances  including recognition of the need for moreand better aid  establishment of the PeacebuildingCommission  a doubling of resources for the Office ofthe Commissioner for Human Rights and therecognition of our shared “responsibility to protect”.We have as our theme for the General Assemblyimplementation of our summit undertakings. We shareaccountability for getting the job done. I shall confinemy comments here to the results of the summit.New Zealand is pleased with the SummitOutcome as it relates to development. It represents ashared commitment by all Member States to theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) andrecognizes the important partnership betweendeveloped and developing countries in the effective useof aid.This year New Zealand has increased itsdevelopment assistance by 23 per cent. Our officialdevelopment assistance (ODA) programme has a focuson poverty elimination  with a core  but not exclusive focus on the Pacific. We strive to address aideffectiveness  the particular problems faced by smallisland developing States  HIV/AIDS  the empowermentof women  sexual and reproductive health and rights education for all  sustainable development and tradeaccess.On trade  we look forward to an ambitiousoutcome across all aspects of the Doha DevelopmentAgenda  including in agriculture  improved marketaccess  the elimination of export subsidies andsubstantial reductions in trade distorting domesticsupport. Improving the coherence of trade policies anddevelopment initiatives remains a critical element inachieving the MDGs.New Zealand welcomes the decision to establisha Peacebuilding Commission to help break the cycle ofconflict by better coordinating long-term internationalrecovery efforts and ensuring sustained politicalattention to those who need it. We must now moveswiftly to get the Commission up and running byDecember this year. We look to the General AssemblyPresident to take a lead in holding consultations toachieve this. The core elements of the framework havealready been discussed at length and in detail. Withgood will and determination  we can surely arrive atagreement within the next few weeks on a package.This should ensure balanced membership and flexiblereporting arrangements. We would caution againstraising the bar for assistance too high  and we hopethat all States in need of help will be able to approachthe Commission.Our leaders have spoken with one voice andunequivocally to condemn all forms of terrorism. Wemust build on this and honour our undertaking toconclude negotiations on the comprehensiveconvention on international terrorism at this session.New Zealand will continue to work closely with ourfriends in the Pacific region to improve our collectiveabilities to identify  prevent or respond to terroristthreats. Consolidating reporting requirements createdby Security Council resolutions would  we believe  beone step towards enhancing the counter-terrorismprogramme of the United Nations. We think it veryimportant that Member States should now support theSecretary-General’s counter-terrorism strategy.One of the most far-reaching achievements of thesummit  as many countries have acknowledged  is ourcollective acceptance that there is a responsibility toprotect populations from genocide  war crimes  ethniccleansing and crimes against humanity. We must nowall be prepared to assist the United Nations inestablishing the early warning capability referred to inour outcome document. It is vital that  when the needarises  we give effect to our resolve and follow theprinciples we have agreed upon.In this context  New Zealand wishes to reaffirmits commitment to ending impunity for thoseresponsible for the most serious crimes of concern tothe international community. Adoption of the RomeStatute of the International Criminal Court was anhistoric moment for the United Nations and one thatdemonstrated the breadth and depth of political will toend impunity and to secure the rule of law.20The absence of any reference to a commitment toend impunity or of any acknowledgement of theInternational Criminal Court’s central contribution tothis goal is one of several telling silences in oursummit outcome.We are particularly pleased that leaders haverecognized the need to conclude  during this session negotiations on the draft protocol to the Convention onthe Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.This will be a major priority for New Zealand. We callon all Member States to contribute constructively tothis process  so that we can reach agreement on aprotocol and demonstrate our full support for the workof United Nations personnel in the field.New Zealand welcomes the emphasis on humanrights in the outcome document. That the budget of theOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights isto be doubled and her Office strengthened is anoverdue recognition of the gap between expectations ofdelivery and resourcing.While progress has been made through thesummit decision to establish a Human Rights Council we regret that the opportunity was lost to reachagreement on details of the Council’s mandate andoperation  despite the support of a great majority ofMembers for such a package. A small minority cannotbe allowed to veto the establishment of the Council.Over the next weeks we must redouble our effortsto translate that broad support into specifics on whatthe Council will look like and on its mandate. We shalllook to the President to set a work programme that willaim for agreement on the details.Our second human rights priority for the sixtiethsession is to see negotiations completed on the draftconvention on the rights of persons with disabilities.The constructive and collegial spirit of delegations inthe Ad Hoc Committee on the rights of persons withdisabilities has been extraordinary. New Zealand isconfident that it will be possible to conclude thenegotiations in 2006 if the Ad Hoc Committee isenabled to meet for three weeks next January.Our ability to strengthen the United Nationsacross the board in development  security and humanrights will be enhanced by implementing summitundertakings on Secretariat and management reform.We need particularly to improve the managerialeffectiveness and accountability of the Secretary-General. He should be given  as he has requested  thetools that he needs to manage the Secretariat.We strongly support the review of all budgetaryand human resource rules and regulations and thereview of mandates. We support also the increasedfocus on ensuring ethical conduct on the part of allUnited Nations personnel. We believe a system-widecode of ethics and an independent ethics office wouldfacilitate that. New Zealand also welcomes thecommitment to strengthening the United NationsOffice of Internal Oversight Services.The outcome document calls for early reform ofthe Security Council  and the General Assembly is toreview progress on this issue by the end of the year.New Zealand continues to believe that the SecurityCouncil needs to be more effective and morerepresentative for the twenty-first century  although wehave no illusions about the difficulties of reachingagreement on this.We should in the meantime renew our efforts toimprove the working methods of the Security Council.For those many Member States who rarely  if ever occupy a non-permanent seat on the Council  thereshould be other ways to participate in Councildecisions and contribute to discussions.We  as Member States  have shown in finalizingthe summit outcome a mixture of courage andcreativity on the one hand and of stubbornness andhesitation on the other. The implementation periodahead gives us a second chance to make good on thosemoments when we allowed agreements to slip throughour fingers. We put our trust in our President to set upthe structures for ongoing work and to be the catalystto motivate and energize us.In closing  I would like to acknowledge the muchvalued contribution that former President Ping madeover the last year  and we thank him."
"128",5452,"PAK",60,2005,"Let me congratulate thePresident of the current session and former PresidentJean Ping for the success of the historic sixtiethanniversary summit. We admire the dedication andskill with which President Ping conducted thepreparations for the summit. We thank the Secretary-General for his initiative to convene the summit and hisnumerous constructive ideas to advance developmentand United Nations reform.Pakistan supported adoption of the outcomedocument. It reflects the existing consensus on a rangeof issues. However  like many others  we aredisappointed with the results. We could have achievedmore  perhaps  if the agenda were not so extensive  ifSecurity Council reform had not sapped energy fromthe preparatory process  and if the negotiations on thedocument had been commenced earlier.Development was  and remains  of the highestpriority for the vast majority of Member States. Thesummit was to focus on fulfilment of the26internationally agreed development goals. There arewelcome recommendations on official developmentassistance (ODA) targets  debt relief  enhancing andimproving aid and addressing the special needs ofAfrica; but we did not advance very much on trade investment flows and global governance.However  we can recover lost ground and losttime on development through a focused and moredetermined implementation process. The objectivemust be accorded first priority. Fortunately  agreementexists already on development goals  including theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Thedeveloping countries are adopting national strategies toachieve those goals. Development partners must nowdemonstrate the political will to fully support thenational strategies and to accept greater equity in theinternational trade and financial systems.We must quickly put in place an effectivemechanism to promote and monitor the implementationof the goals and agreements on development. Adequateresources must be provided for the purpose.The summit emphasized the role of the Economicand Social Council in promoting policy dialogue development cooperation  post-conflict developmentand coordination within the United Nations system.Pakistan believes that the Economic and SocialCouncil should now serve as the central forum forfollow-up and implementation of the developmentcommitments made at the summit. In this regard  wewould propose that the model developed for trackingtsunami aid — the so-called DAD (DevelopmentAssistance Database) system — be replicated to assessthe status of implementation of the agreed developmentgoals. Pakistan has also offered to convene a high-levelinformal meeting of members of the Economic andSocial Council and other stakeholders towards the endof this year to review the steps taken to advance theimplementation of the development goals and decideon further measures.The widely recognized interlinkage betweenpeace and development has now been institutionalizedwith the decision to establish the PeacebuildingCommission. Pakistan is proud that the PeacebuildingCommission evolved from the concept of ad hoccomposite committees that we introduced in 2003. As amajor troop contributor to United Nationspeacekeeping operations and  in particular  through ourengagement in complex missions  such as in SierraLeone  Liberia  the Democratic Republic of the Congoand Burundi  Pakistan has a wealth of experience andexpertise to contribute to the work of the PeacebuildingCommission. We shall take part actively in thediscussions to be held in the General Assembly tofinalize the details and modalities for thecommencement of the Commission’s work.Terrorism is a global menace and requires acollective response. Pakistan has been a major target ofterrorism. We are at the forefront of the internationalwar against terrorism. At home  the PakistanGovernment has instituted a number of short- and long-term measures to eliminate terrorism and extremism.These include banning extremist organizations anddetention of extremists  crackdowns against hatematerial  halting the misuse of religious institutions registration and reform of the madrassas and fightingilliteracy and poverty.The summit has endorsed the elaboration of acomprehensive strategy against terrorism. We shouldset up an ad hoc working group to elaborate thisstrategy. A comprehensive strategy should opposeterrorism  wherever and by whomever — individuals groups or States. No strategy can be comprehensive ifit does not address the factors that contribute toextremism  including poverty  political and economicinjustice  foreign occupation and denial of the right toself-determination.Dialogue and understanding between civilizationsand religions should also be an essential component ofa comprehensive strategy on terrorism. There areseveral noteworthy and mutually reinforcing initiativesthat can be coalesced to generate international andnational action. These include President Musharraf’sstrategy of “enlightened moderation”  which seeks tosimultaneously promote internal reform in the Islamicworld and the active support of the internationalcommunity to help resolve political disputes andaddress the socio-economic and developmentchallenges of the Islamic world.The failure to achieve agreement on disarmamentand non-proliferation in the outcome document reflectsthe deep differences that exist among Member States.This is dangerous for peace and stability  especially inregions of tension. It is time for the internationalcommunity  for the entire United Nations membership not just some self-selected States  to promote a newconsensus on disarmament and non-proliferation27through the Conference on Disarmament or a specialsession of the Disarmament Commission.The summit also could not achieve full consensuson how to ensure the effective promotion of humanrights that  along with “peace and development”  is thethird pillar of United Nations reform. We should buildon the agreement reached to evolve a full consensus.Pakistan will join in creating a new and representativeHuman Rights Council as a subsidiary body of theGeneral Assembly. Its mandate and methods mustpromote cooperation rather than confrontation. Wemust also improve and rationalize the Sub-Commissionon the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights  thehost of special mechanisms that exist on the subjectand the participation of civil society in the work of theUnited Nations on human rights. We feel that thisexercise of reform should be entrusted to a workinggroup in Geneva.We have committed ourselves to strengtheningthe United Nations and making it more effective efficient  democratic and accountable. Our pledge toreaffirm the central position of the General Assemblyshould be given real meaning. The Assembly’s role andmandate should be preserved from encroachment especially by the Security Council. It is the GeneralAssembly that should ensure the follow-up of thesummit’s decisions.In its capacity as President of the Economic andSocial Council  Pakistan will work closely withmember States to implement the proposed enhancedrole of the Council with adjustments to the Council’sorganization  agenda and working methods.The Security Council has the primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  but it lacks transparency anddemocracy. It is neither fully representative noraccountable to the general membership. The rationalefor its reform is  therefore  clear. The Council shouldbe enlarged by adding 10 additional non-permanentmembers to reflect the entire spectrum of the UnitedNations membership. It could allow immediatere-election to enable major countries to seek morefrequent membership of the Council  but it should notadd to inequality by inducting new permanentmembers. That would alienate many importantcountries  divide and weaken the United Nations andfurther reduce the Council’s credibility and legitimacy.The proposal of Uniting for Consensus isequitable  fair and democratic. It has the flexibility toaccommodate the positions and aspirations of allcountries and regional and political groupings including those of Africa. It will increase therepresentation of the general membership in theSecurity Council. It will enhance the stature of theGeneral Assembly by making the Council moreaccountable to the general membership. We are readyto continue efforts — in any open and transparentformat  including that of the General Assembly’sOpen-ended Working Group — to reach consensus onSecurity Council reform.Pakistan is gratified that the summit reaffirmedthe central values and principles of the United Nationsand acknowledged that the range of threats we facerequires our urgent  collective and more determinedresponse. It also acknowledged that many threats areinterdependent. We welcome the renewed emphasis onthe peaceful settlement of disputes and on the Charter’sstrict constraints on the use of force. It is befitting thatwe are observing the International Day of Peace today.Pakistan believes that while dealing with newthreats  such as terrorism and weapons of massdestruction  the United Nations must continue toaccord priority to addressing and resolving thenumerous disputes and conflicts that afflict so manyregions of our world.In Africa  there is a new dynamic of regionalownership and international engagement andpartnership in addressing conflicts and complex crises.Progress is  however  mixed. Relative improvements inSierra Leone and Liberia are in contrast with numerouschallenges in Côte d’Ivoire  the Democratic Republicof the Congo and Burundi. We are heartened by theprospects of peace in the Sudan. Somalia  on the otherhand  still awaits the international attention andsupport needed to restore security and consolidate thepainful gains in the peace process. Pakistan willcontinue to contribute to United Nations andinternational efforts for the restoration of peace andstability in Africa.The early resolution of the Israeli-Palestinianissue in accordance with the relevant United Nationsresolutions and a two-State solution would usher in anera of peace and stability in the Middle East. We havewelcomed Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza  and wetrust that it will be followed by withdrawal from the28West Bank  leading to the creation of an independentand viable Palestinian State. Pakistan will do whateverit can to promote durable peace in the Middle East.That would help considerably to eliminate theconditions that encourage extremism and terrorism.Pakistan also hopes for the early restoration ofpeace and security in Iraq. We should encourage ademocratic consensus among its peoples and regionsthat preserves Iraq’s unity and territorial integrity  aswell as the strengthening of its national capability topreserve security by combating violence and terrorism.Afghanistan has completed another milestonewith the successful holding of parliamentary elections.The international community must remain fullyengaged to help Afghanistan overcome the remainingchallenges. Pakistan is committed  bilaterally andmultilaterally  to support efforts for peace  security development and reconstruction in Afghanistan. Wewish to see the 3 million Afghan refugees whom westill host return to their homes in safety and honour.There should be no self-serving questions orquibbling about Pakistan’s commitment andcontribution to peace and security in Afghanistan which are in Pakistan’s own best interest. Pakistan isactively engaged in halting illegal cross-bordermovement and containing the threat posed by theTaliban and Al-Qaida  including through the Pakistan-Afghanistan-United States Tripartite Commission.Pakistan’s military presence along the border farexceeds the combined strength of the national andinternational military presence in Afghanistan. Werecently proposed partial fencing of the border inlimited areas to minimize the chances for illegalmovements. We hope that that will be accepted andimplemented in the spirit in which it was offered.Relations between India and Pakistan areimproving. There is new hope for peace andcooperation in South Asia. We must also give that hopeto the people of Jammu and Kashmir in their legitimatequest for self-determination. In his address to thesummit on 14 September  President Musharraf said thatPakistan and India must not remain trapped by hate andhistory in a cycle of confrontation and conflict. Toprevent that from happening  it is essential to find ajust solution to the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir acceptable to Pakistan  India and  above all  the peopleof Kashmir. On the same day  the President met withthe Indian Prime Minister  Mr. Manmohan Singh  inNew York to further advance the ongoing compositedialogue between our two countries.Peace in our neighbourhood will also provide afillip to the efforts being undertaken by Pakistan forrapid and equitable socio-economic development. Weshare the emphasis placed by the summit on the role ofnational policies and development strategies in theachievement of sustainable development. TheGovernment has taken a series of actions to transformPakistan into a modern  dynamic  progressive anddemocratic Islamic State. Our policies have producedvisible results: macroeconomic stability  8.4 per centgrowth in gross domestic product last year  a reducedfiscal deficit and growing export earnings  externalremittances and investment. The major focus of ourGovernment now is to accelerate the transfer ofeconomic benefits to the people of Pakistan. We areconfident that we will achieve all the targets of theMillennium Development Goals.Pakistan is also succeeding against terrorism andextremism. It is on the path to sustainable democracy.Our people have been empowered from the grass-rootslevel up. That includes guaranteed 30 per centrepresentation of women at all levels. Minorities havebeen brought into the mainstream. We are determinedto sustain those positive trends in our nationaldevelopment. At the same time  we are working toforge close economic partnerships in the region andbeyond.It is in the same spirit of constructive engagementthat Pakistan wishes to pursue cooperativemultilateralism and to strengthen the United Nations —this unique forum that is indispensable  in ourinterdependent world  for all States  large or small powerful or weak.Pakistan participated actively in  and contributedconstructively to  the preparation of the summit and itsoutcome. We are committed to furthering the reformprocess in the follow-up to the summit’s decisions. Welook forward to working closely with all other MemberStates and would like to assure the Assembly of ourfull cooperation in this historic endeavour."
"129",5495,"PAN",60,2005,"Allowme  Sir  to express the congratulations of theGovernment of Panama on your election to presideover this historic session of the General Assembly.I would like to congratulate warmly theSecretary-General for the dedicated manner in whichhe has undertaken the difficult task of reforming theUnited Nations so as to ensure that it will be able toaddress the challenges of the twenty-first century.I wish to express my special thanks in particularto the outgoing President of the General Assembly Mr. Jean Ping  for his efforts in leading theconsultations and reflections in order to attainagreement and  in particular  for placing his trust in thedelegation of Panama in order to facilitate this process.The United Nations was conceived on afundamental premise  that of the legal equality ofStates  which at the time was more of an aspirationthan a reality. However  much progress has been madeon the path towards building a world where the powerof reason  justice and dialogue settle disputes betweennations and not military or economic power.My country can confirm that the United Nationsand the international community have created effectiveinstruments and institutions to ensure that equalityprevails over the deep divide between theindustrialized countries and the developing countries.Panama has gained full control of its territory andrecovered the Canal thanks to its visionary leaders  butalso to a large extent due to the implementation of theprinciples of international law that the United Nationshas staunchly defended and through the support of theinternational community.Panama can never remain indifferent to thedestiny of the Organization. As one of the signatoriesof the Charter and beneficiary of its institutions Panama understands the need to adapt the Organizationto the reality of our time. The formulas used forbringing this adaptation about must focus on increasedparticipation of States in the Organization’s decisionsand must aim at the full legal equality of all States  anaspiration that has yet to become a reality  but which nevertheless  remains the mainstay of the UnitedNations.We cannot afford to delay in bringing about aradical change in the rules that currently governeconomic relations among States  because  while in theUnited Nations we are slowly progressing towardsequality and agreement  the world is rushing towardsan abyss of inequality and disagreement.Despite the efforts undertaken by a number of theleast developed countries to adapt their institutions tomodels that were supposed to help reduce inequalities practice has shown that there is no one-size-fits-allsolution that can be applied across the board to allcountries. Indeed  the application of rigid solutions hascontributed rather to a further widening of the gapbetween countries.Amid such uncertainty concerning our publicdevelopment policies  unforeseeable events — naturaldisasters  epidemics and  currently  the rising price ofoil  an indispensable driver of production and15growth — have completely altered the balance offoreign and domestic affairs. Moreover  it is unclearwhether the negative impact those events have had onour economies will vanish automatically once thephenomena that have created them disappear. Indeed  itappears that we are caught in a vicious and hopelesscircle: the differences that have led us to accept urgentchanges have  in turn  created more difference andgreater resentment in the least developed countries with more failed States and therefore greater insecurityin the global village.The price of oil for non-producing countries hasfurther deepened that divide  as it takes away from theresources necessary for their development. To give anexample  over the past three years the cost of netimports of oil for Panama has shown a 250 per centincrease. That is the situation for the majority of thecountries in our region  as well as for those in othercontinents  with very few exceptions. Countries likeours that are net importers of oil have to produce morein order to export more and thereby to be able toimport the same number of barrels of oil.Rising oil prices are due to the sharp increase indemand by the major consumers  which have notadopted effective policies to reduce their dependencyon hydrocarbons.Even more serious is the fact that fuel prices haverisen so dramatically and have wreaked such havoc in anumber of countries they threaten to create politicalinstability and provoke economic crises.It is only with the technical and financialcooperation of developed countries — in particular inthe field of energy — that we can achieve the transferof technologies that can help us to produce cleaner andcheaper energy. As a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol Panama has submitted projects with clearly identifiedrequests for financing that deserve to be supported bymultilateral funding institutions and by those countriesthat cause the greatest pollution.Energy dependency is compounded by thedifficulties that countries face in importing technologyand holding on to their human resources  in particularthe most qualified among them. Workers that havemigrated to richer countries send home financialremittances that can temporarily supplement theincome generated by our national economies but that in the long term  prevent us from exploiting our mostimportant asset — our most highly qualified humanresources. Those workers contribute to the innovativegrowth that our nations require. The result is theaccumulation of innovative capital and productivelabour in the most developed countries  with acorresponding impoverishment of countries most inneed of those resources  generating yet greaterdivergence and more inequalities. In other words  theexodus of human capital  while providing a source ofcurrency in the short term hampers our countries’ long-term development.Our countries must be able to compete even inthe absence of a level playing field. We must as apriority put an end to tariff barriers to trade  whichprevent developing countries from putting theirproducts on the markets of rich countries and fromhaving access to better technology  not only productivebut also information technology.As a result of the widening gap with regard toaccess to technology  our countries have fallen behindin their efforts to advance and to ensure the well-beingof their people. Moreover  it has served to perpetuatethe differences in living conditions between developedcountries and those that are still struggling to emergefrom underdevelopment.The situation is similar with regard to theobstacles that impede access to basic medicines toimprove public health in areas as sensitive as AIDSand malaria. Those obstacles take the form of patentsthat grant quasi-monopolistic powers to thepharmaceutical companies that produce thosemedicines.In addition  the already devastating differencesthat exist between States are even greater than thestatistics currently show  using simplistic and rigidcriteria such as per capita income  which does notaccurately reflect reality. Forty per cent of thePanamanian population lives below the poverty line but we are nevertheless statistically designated as amedium- to high-income country and therefore ouraccess to external aid is very limited. Figures provideonly a lifeless snapshot of a country. Behind that  orperhaps in spite of that  there is a human reality: that ofmen  women and children who suffer from hunger andconstraints. Those people are not even aware of theexistence of the United Nations  but they are fullyentitled to the benefits of modernity. Instead  their wayof life is being relentlessly handed down from onegeneration to the next.16The international community has demonstratedgreat resolve in the fight against terrorism andinsecurity and it is prepared to make even furthersacrifices  if necessary. However  it is time torecognize that hunger and poverty also undermine theinternal security of our countries and endangerdemocracy. It appears that the world only responds toheadlines  but every day poor countries suffer frommisfortunes and constraints that do not produceheadlines for the tragic reason that the internationalcommunity seems indifferent in some cases or hasquite simply resigned itself to them.There is no point in asking a developing countryto rectify so many deficiencies within a reasonabletime frame if it cannot even have access to funds onmore favourable and predictable terms than thosecurrently being offered by the international capitalmarket.Improving the quality of life of our citizens — agoal that the United Nations has set itself — dependson the increasing use of physical and financial capital as well as the national labour force  in activities thatgenerate growth and promote innovation. The materialwell-being of our societies will be achieved when morepeople work and each of those workers is moreproductive.Our countries are not begging for favours. Whatwe are demanding is a more level playing field. Themarkets of industrialized countries are blocked byprotectionist tariffs and by non-tariff barriers  whichimpede access to them by the rest of the world. Themost developed countries pursue agricultural policiesthat seriously exacerbate poverty in developingcountries. For one thing  their domestic productionreceives billions of dollars in subsidies. The surplusthus created is then dumped on world markets at pricesthat significantly reduce the income of the traditionalexporting countries.Therefore Panama welcomes the commitment ofthe United States of America  announced last weekfrom this very rostrum by its President  to eliminate allsubsidies that — as he himself recognized — havecreated poverty in many countries. If all thosecountries that subsidize their products to the detrimentof free trade were to adopt here a similar commitmentand to implement it swiftly  then the United Nationswould have solid grounds to celebrate its sixtiethanniversary as an historic and highly significantoccasion.For its part  Panama reiterates today that thecanal linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans willremain open and secure  demonstrating the high degreeof efficiency to which the international community isaccustomed. We have analysed the needs ofinternational trade and  aware of Panama’s role in theera of globalization  we shall take a definitive decisionon the canal’s extension through a national referendum.Our countries should not be condemned tostagger from one crisis to the next. By emphasizing theneed to combat the alarming levels of poverty andabject poverty  humankind’s collective conscience willemerge in favour of development and progress. ThisOrganization was created at the end of the cruelest warof all times in order to protect humankind from thehorrors of a similar conflict and to ensure that peaceand harmony would prevail throughout the world.Panama welcomes the progress that has beenmade towards that goal and rejects any attempt to delaythe application of peaceful solutions to regions thatcontinue to suffer a high level of political tension thatseriously endangers peace. That is our vision of theinequalities of a society founded on the principles ofthe twentieth century  and an expression of cautiousoptimism about the opportunities to blaze a new trailfor the benefit of our people  who want to leave theirfears behind and to attain the dreams that all areentitled to simply by virtue of being alive."
"130",5542,"PER",60,2005,"Allow me first  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.  I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to express from the very bottom of the Peruvian heart our sincere feeling of solidarity with the women and men of the United States who have suffered as a result of the natural disasters in Mississippi  Alabama and other southern states. Their suffering is shared by us  just as we would share suffering anywhere in the world. I am sure that the faith and hope of the people of the United States will enable them to overcome this tragedy.  A year ago in this forum (see A/59/PV.5) I spoke of the need to face  with vision and realism  the new challenges now facing us  the developing countries in particular. On the one hand  our countries are becoming part of the globalization of production  trade  financial flows  the digital telecommunications revolution  and the spread of values such as democracy and human rights. At the same time  however  the world is fragmented by an increase in social inequities  the proliferation of civil wars  the collapse of States  genocide  terrorism  transnational crime and environmental degradation. These contradictory trends of globalization on the one hand and fragmentation on the other  call into question the governance within States and within the international system  and ultimately call into question international collective security itself.  Peace and security and the stability of the global system are not related only to political  military and strategic issues. Peace and security also have social and economic components. Poverty and exclusion conspire against peace  security and democracy. Social exclusion triggers violence and instability  renders democracy fragile and leads to national and international fragmentation.   That is why we must agree on action to confront these contradictions. That is the main commitment that we as States undertook at the recent High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Goals  and that is what the United Nations and the multilateral system as a whole must tackle next. That is why I am highlighting the two main axes along which these commitments must develop. I refer to security on the one hand and development on the other.  While each country is responsible for its own development  it must be recognized that development encounters obstacles at the international level that call for new partnerships and new forms of association. These must go beyond the assistance-based paradigm characterizing much so-called development assistance. And  more important  they must overcome the asymmetry that currently prevails in relations between developed and developing countries.  On the one hand  developing countries are being asked to commit to open their markets  to foreign investment regimes and to reforming their public administrations. We agree with all of that. But there is no matching solid commitment that developed countries will  as promised  allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product (GNP) for cooperation. Nor — even less — do we see obstacles to foreign trade being dismantled.   The new partnership for development has to overcome adverse factors for developing countries and eliminate obstacles such as rigid intellectual property standards  the speculative volatility of global capital  the lack of foreign investment  subsidies  the debt burden  and  above all  the absence of genuine special and differential treatment in trade negotiations for developing countries.   This is not only about receiving assistance to reduce poverty; it is also about a new association for development that will make it possible to generate employment and create wealth. Implementing this new partnership would fulfil Millennium Development Goal 8 and the commitments made in the Monterrey Consensus. That is why it is necessary for the Doha round to be completed next year. That is tremendously important.   As the Millennium Declaration recognizes  a very important cross-cutting element in the partnership for development is assuring the sustainability of the environment. As proof of our commitment  I was proud    8 05-51226  some days ago to deposit the instruments of ratification of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade  both of which are intended to reduce the negative impact of pollution.  As it carries out its development agenda  the international system must strengthen collective security to confront threats such as terrorism  nuclear proliferation  and organized transnational crime. This year again  we have been shaken by acts of terrorism perpetuated all over the world. Peru suffered from  and combated  terror for many long years  and expresses its solidarity with the victims of these criminal acts. We reiterate our firm condemnation of all acts of terrorism and restate our commitment  through mutual cooperation  to prevent  combat  punish and eradicate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Peru appeals to the Assembly not to continue to delay the adoption of a comprehensive counter-terrorism convention.   For my Government  international peace and security is a prime objective  and we have adopted the following measures in that context. First  Peru is promoting the limitation of defence spending at the regional level in order to release resources for social investment. The first decision I adopted on my Government’s first day in office was to cut back military expenditure in my country by 23 per cent in order to allocate it to food  health  education and social investments. Progress in this field has been significant; there are agreements with Chile  Colombia and Ecuador to craft and implement standardized methodologies to reduce our military spending.  Secondly  Peru was an advocate of the creation of the South American Zone of Peace and Cooperation and the Andean Zone of Peace  which have been recognized in Assembly resolutions 57/13 and 59/54  respectively.  Thirdly  Peru participated actively in formulating the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.   Fourthly  Peru is participating in peacekeeping operations by providing troops  staff officers  military observers and equipment. To increase our contribution in this area  Peru has signed a memorandum of understanding under the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System  which includes army  air force and navy units. Currently  Peruvian Blue Helmets are participating in peacekeeping operations in Eritrea-Ethiopia  Liberia  Côte d’Ivoire  Burundi  the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  as well as in Cyprus and Haiti. We cherish peace.  For all these reasons  Peru is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term 2006-2007 in the elections to be held during this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I should like here to express Peru’s deep gratitude for the majority support for our candidacy; we now enjoy the widest possible support from Latin American and Caribbean countries as well as from our brother countries in Africa and Asia  the Arab League States and countries of Europe and of Oceania. This generous support encourages us and strengthens our commitment to work with dedication and responsibility in the Security Council. We are grateful for this opportunity and the support offered by countries worldwide for our candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2006-2007. "
"131",5589,"PHL",60,2005,"I convey mydelegation’s felicitations on your election Mr. President  on leading this historic session. I alsowish to express our deep appreciation to AmbassadorJean Ping  whose leadership and wisdom proved to bethe key to the successful negotiation and adoption ofour outcome document.Sixty years ago  enduring peace was foremost inthe minds of the founders of our Organization. Scarredfrom war and stunned by mankind’s capacity for deathand destruction  they did not consider failure an option.Our common humanity demanded that we build abetter and peaceful world. To do that  representativesfrom 50 nations gathered in San Francisco  in abuilding dedicated to those who defended and foughtfor freedom  to draft a charter that would unite thenations of the world for peace. General Carlos P.Romulo  the head of the Philippine delegation articulating the hopes of mankind  said then at theUnited Nations: “Let us make this floor the lastbattlefield.”Mr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran)  Vice-President  took the Chair.The leading lights attending the founding of theUnited Nations are still familiar to us — Joseph PaulBoncour of France  Wellington Koo of China  AndreiGromyko of Russia  Lord Halifax of the UnitedKingdom  Edward Stettinius of the United States  HisRoyal Highness Faisal ibn Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar of India  Jan Smuts of theUnion of South Africa  Jan Masaryk ofCzechoslovakia  Herbert Evatt of Australia  ExequielPadilla of Mexico  and many others. Those visionariesled the historic and daunting task of writing the UnitedNations Charter.A third of mankind was still under colonialdomination. Only three Asian nations were inattendance. Most of Africa were not yet independentnations. In a forum dominated by colonial Powers  thePhilippines fought to ensure the notion that the goal ofthe Trusteeship Council should not only be self-government but independence.When the United Nations emblem was beingdrawn  General Romulo asked that the Philippines although still a commonwealth  be included. He wastold that the Philippines would only be a small dot onthat now familiar map. He demanded nevertheless thatthe dot be placed on the map.The Philippines insistence on its place on theworld map  albeit just a dot  symbolized for manysoon-to-be independent and developing nations thechallenge facing the United Nations. The clearchallenge facing the United Nations at its inception and particularly developing nations  was to ensure thatfreedom from want  freedom from fear and freedom topursue human dignity would be at the heart of thepolitical independence of the States.Sixty years after San Francisco  we continue toface the challenge of freeing all our peoples from wantand from fear and allowing them the true dignity thatthey deserve as independent nations. The fight for thepolitical and legal independence of States is over  butthe fight to win for all peoples their freedom from fearand want and to pursue human dignity continues.For the Philippines  as a developing country freedom from want is of utmost concern. Poverty  theenergy crisis and insufficient financial resources compounded by debt  are the pressing challenges5facing my country and its people. We also face serioussecurity threats  particularly from terrorism — withmany of our citizens victimized by terrorist attacks. Werecognize the economic and social underpinnings ofsuch acts.In the not too distant past  my country also had toconfront the threat of the severe acute respiratorysyndrome (SARS). Our national experience prompts usto agree with the Secretary-General that these globalthreats are all interrelated  and our differentperceptions of the imminence of the threats facing usshould not deter us from cooperating to address them.This brings me to my central theme — that weshould let the bond of our broad vision of our commonhumanity inspire us all to work towards a strongerUnited Nations for a better world.We agree with the Secretary-General that nonation can defend itself against threats entirely on itsown. We agree that development  freedom from fearand human rights concerns are interrelated and shouldbe equally considered in designing the solutions to thethreats we face. We believe that because of thisinterrelation  these concerns should be addressed in acomprehensive and integrated manner.The world is facing the problem of unbridledspiralling of oil prices. International cooperation onenergy is increasingly becoming an imperative as thecapacity and capability of countries  particularly non-oil producing developing countries  to meet theirdevelopment objectives  including the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs)  are affected. Thisunavoidably impacts on security.The Philippines welcomes the 100 per cent debtcancellation for the 38 heavily indebted poor countries.However  the debt situation is expected to worsen  asmiddle-income countries go deeper in debt with thethreat of rising world oil prices. Once more  the needfor other innovative and creative means of internationalcooperation for debt relief also becomes imperative.The Philippines has proposed the consideration ofthe adoption of a debt conversion schemeincluding “debt-for-equity” or “debt-for-MillenniumDevelopment Goal projects”. The scheme calls for theconversion of 50 per cent of the debt service intoequity for MDG projects of at least equal value with anincome earning potential.Debt for development projects can focus on areasthat would achieve MDG benchmarks such as hospitalsand health care  schools  classrooms  informationtechnology  clean water  electricity  reforestation  eco-tourism and many others that should help us achieveour MDGs by 2015.The nexus between development andinternational migration cannot be overlooked.Migration brings challenges and opportunities tocountries of origin  destination and transit. This isanother multifaceted issue that requires internationalcooperation to be addressed in a coordinated andcoherent manner. A comprehensive and effectiveinternational mechanism for cooperation should bedrawn up to address its politico-security  social cultural and economic development dimensions.As one of the major sending States  thePhilippines stands ready to cooperate with all countriesin contributing towards the formulation of effectivemechanisms that would help ensure a smoothmanagement of the migration phenomenon.The Philippines knows only too well the fear thatterrorism instils in the civilian population and theanguish it brings to victims and close relatives. Wetake cognizance of terrorism’s political  social andeconomic underpinnings.Our national experience has shown us the valueof dialogue in our approach to consider all thosefactors. The Philippines wants to share this positivevalue of dialogue and therefore has taken the lead indrawing attention to the need for interfaith dialogue asan integral part for the promotion of the culture ofpeace. My President recently convened a successfulinformal summit on interfaith dialogue and cooperationhere in the United Nations. The summit adopted adeclaration calling for greater interreligious intercultural and intercivilizational dialogue andcooperation to ensure a lasting and durable peace andunderstanding at the global  regional and nationallevels. We invite all who agree with its principles toconsider endorsing the declaration.We all acknowledge that the world has reached anunprecedented stage when there are virtually no morebarriers  whether of space or time. Communicationtechnology has made possible the dissemination ofinformation instantaneously to practically all parts andcorners of the globe.6As the nineteenth century brought us theindustrial revolution  the twentieth century brought usto the technology revolution ushered in bycomputerization. The twenty-first century now offersinfinite possibilities to further advance the informationage. At no other time has the saying “no man is anisland” rang truer. As the Secretary-General has said what affects one affects all in this globalized world.However  the information age is a two-edgedsword  as experience has shown us. While it openedopportunities  it also brought challenges that we allhave to cope with. Our concern however is that just asthe limitless opportunities it offered could be used tobenefit humanity  it could also be used destructively.Information technology enables companies to searchfor lowest cost factors of production globally  operatemore efficiently and pass on the benefits to consumers.However  this same technology also enablesdisillusioned and desperate members of society tobecome agents of terror and recruit adherents to theirway of thinking as well as to fund their destructiveactivities. It is therefore in our common interest tobring together our collective strengths to takeadvantage of the opportunities before us as well as toconfront common threats.For 60 years  the United Nations has provided usthe forum to draw up norms of conduct that take onboard all our concerns. From its inception with 51Member States in 1945  the membership has almostquadrupled to its present 191 States.While the United Nations has  time and again adopted some reforms  at no other time has thepressure for far-reaching change been starker than it isnow. The evolving global and regional securityenvironment  ongoing conflicts in many countries thathave multidimensional root causes and otherflashpoints have to be addressed. It is clear that inpursuing our shared interest to preserve our commonhumanity  the United Nations continues to serve as ourindispensable tool. It is therefore also our sharedinterest to strengthen it.Even before San Francisco  some key decisionshad already been reached among the major Powers primarily on the power of the veto  or what wasreferred to then as the “unanimity rule”. Ourdelegation  in concert with others  pressed for anincreased role of the General Assembly. We felt thatthis was the balance necessary to safeguard theeffectiveness of the United Nations in maintaininginternational peace and security. We also urged widerand more equitable representation in the SecurityCouncil — an aspiration that has yet to achieverealization  and thus an advocacy that my countrycarries to this day.The outcome document of the High-level PlenaryMeeting provides the substance upon which tostrengthen the United Nations system. It should guideus well in our discussions on institutional reform.Six decades after San Francisco  our commonhumanity remains at stake. We have today anotheropportunity to make our United Nations succeed.Whether the issue is United Nations reform or freedomfrom want or fear  we must act now to ensure that theprinciples committed to by our leaders at this year’ssummit be implemented effectively and efficiently.Allow me therefore to present at this point somepractical strategies that may assist us in ensuring thatwe achieve our goals.Firstly  the agreed commitments should be brokendown into tangible steps. Concrete benchmarks andpragmatic indicators of progress must be set.Secondly  with concrete internationalbenchmarks  national strategies can be geared toachieving them. All concerned national actors indomestic procedures and actions should be involved.This is necessary to put into effect and implementmultilateral commitments. Ideally  national actorsshould be privy to developments in the negotiatingprocess and have the opportunity to provide their owninputs with respect to the national position to be taken.This is expected to ensure implementation and follow-up to the commitments made by our leaders.Thirdly  we must not lose sight of the need toincrease congruence among national  regional andinternational plans of action. Keeping these in sightcontributes to a faster rate of achieving these goals.National plans of action can be elevated to the regionallevel  whenever feasible.Fourthly  we must rethink our existing modes ofinternational cooperation. There will be value inassessing how we have been collaborating bilaterally regionally and multilaterally. Let us assess theeffectiveness of our current modes of cooperation.7In adopting practical measures and in discoveringnew opportunities and addressing new threats  we mustbe mindful of the old hopes and enduring dreams thatled to the birth of our United Nations. As a child  Ilistened with all innocence as my family closelyfollowed the work of the Philippine delegation in SanFrancisco. I felt proud that my nation  thePhilippines — the Benjamin among the founders —was part of this historic event.We were rebuilding our shattered lives andmourning our dead. Yet we held on to hope. We hadhope that no country would ever again crush us withtheir bombs  trample us with their tanks or defile ourmothers  sisters and daughters. As a nation devastatedby war  we placed great hope in the United Nations. Istill remember the words that made us dare dream of abetter  more peaceful world — words heard by a childthrough the crackle and static of an old radio  wordsspoken by General Carlos P. Romulo in addressing thedelegates in San Francisco in 1945. He said:“Words are more powerful than guns in thedefence of human dignity. Treaties are strongerthan armamented boundaries. The onlyimpregnable line is that of humanunderstanding.”"
"132",5608,"PLW",60,2005,"Palau warmly congratulatesthe President on his election to the presidency of theAssembly and assures him of Palau’s full support andcooperation. We pay tribute to his predecessor  JeanPing of the Gabonese Republic  for his effectiveleadership.At last week’s historic summit  our leaderscreated an agenda for the world. It is our task toundertake concrete measures to advance that agenda.While the outcome document may not have addressedevery issue of importance in a manner that issatisfactory to all  it is inarguably an excellent startingpoint for the hard work that now lies before us. Wemust think of it as a floor  rather than a ceiling  for ourefforts.Palau has much to offer and much to gain from astronger United Nations. We are a new country  thisyear celebrating our eleventh anniversary as anindependent nation and as a Member of the UnitedNations. As Palau takes its place among the communityof nations  a major concern is the development thatwill enable us to stand on our own. In particular  Palauregards the capacity-building expertise of the UnitedNations and its agencies as central to these efforts.As the Secretary-General stated earlier this yearin his report “In larger freedom”  “one of the greatchallenges of the new millennium is to insure that allStates are strong enough to meet the many challengesthey face” (A/59/2005  para. 19). He went on to say “no country  weak or strong  can realize prosperity in avacuum” (ibid.  para. 24).I fear that just such a vacuum exists in manysmall island developing States and that Palau is one ofthem. Not a single United Nations representative canbe found in Palau to assist the country in movingforward. The United Nations flag does not fly there. Sowhen a youngster wants to know whether a capacity-building internship or scholarship might be available there is no one to ask. And when a localenvironmentalist wants to know whether a GlobalEnvironmental Facility Small Grant might be availableto assist in the preservation of an endangered species26that is important to the whole world  there is no one tohelp in submitting an application. In like manner  whenPalau does its part in ratifying an internationalagreement  thus accepting the obligation to rendercomplex reports to an international agency  there is noone to help.The United Nations has attempted to fill thisvacuum through the creation of regional andsubregional centres  which are quite distant fromPalau’s shores. While arguably well intentioned  thistactic has failed to provide Palau with the capacity-building required and has  similarly  prevented theworld from truly understanding Palau’s needs andaspirations. In this sense  these regional andsubregional centres merely replicate the colonialregimes  which the Pacific islands have thrown off —distant capitals making decisions about far-flungprovinces. To Palau  strengthening the United Nationsmeans strengthening its marginalized Members.Palau has willingly taken its place as aresponsible member of the international community.Heeding the Secretary-General’s call to action  Palauthis year proudly deployed a contingent of policepeacekeepers  who now serve in East Timor. And inresponse to the Secretary-General’s stated desire todevelop better gender balance in these missions Palau’s contingent is entirely female.When the world develops important conventions often with burdensome reporting requirements  Palausteps up and signs them  as was the case last weekwhen Palau’s President Remengesau signed theInternational Convention for the Suppression of Actsof Nuclear Terrorism. And when natural disastersstrike  Palau responds willingly  making significantfinancial contributions to remit suffering caused by thetsunami and by Hurricane Katrina. I submit that in bothof these cases  Palau’s contributions were  on a percapita basis  among the highest in the world.Palau asks for very little. But now it asks forhelp  and that help should be forthcoming. As ourPresident Remengesau stated in the Assembly’s 4thmeeting  last week  in his address to the world summit:“It is therefore time for the internationalcommunity  and the United Nations as itsrepresentative  to begin to move beyond studiesthat recognize past failures to achieve sustainabledevelopment in our island nations  and to moveaggressively forward and to establish a specificprogramme agenda that recognizes our uniquesmallness  that appreciates our distinctivediversity  and that respects our island cultures asequal to those in other nations of this world.”Palau’s development challenges are differentfrom those of many of our friends around the worldwho have taken this podium. Hunger is not an issue atpresent in paradise. But the challenges that confrontthe small island nations of the Pacific may ultimatelybe every bit as devastating as famine.Climate change and sea-level rise threaten toobliterate our islands. The very poignant and movingstatement of His Excellency Anote Tong  Beretitenti ofthe Republic of Kiribati at the 15th meeting last weekcontained a chilling preview of what the uncheckedscourge of carbon emissions could mean to all of thecountries in the Pacific  and of course to many otheroceans of the world. The President acknowledged thatthe Government of Kiribati needed now “to seriouslyconsider the option of having to relocate our peopleswhen necessary”. In this understated Pacific way  thePresident forces us all to confront a world where wholecountries simply disappear from the globe. Is there amore compelling call to action than that?The period leading up to such a catastrophe isupon us. Palau must rely on the maintenance of itsextraordinary reefs and waters and its unparalleledbiodiversity to attract tourists. Without these assets  itwill be unable to develop a sustainable economy and tocreate jobs  which will allow its children to live andwork in their homeland.The other pillar of Palau’s development is itsfisheries. For countless generations  our people haverelied on their waters for their sustenance. Now foreign fishing fleets  which have denuded the watersproximate to their own harbours  have come to thePacific and threaten to do the same. The very foodchain is threatened by new fishing practices that though in their infancy  have begun to damage Pacificseamounts in ways that the scientific community deemsalarming. It is for this reason that Palau has called for amoratorium on deep sea bottom trawling until thescientific community can gauge the long-term impactof that practice. We renew that call today and applaudCosta Rica for its leadership on this important issue.We take this opportunity and we are grateful forthis opportunity to commend Palau’s bilateral partnersand friends who have overcome our new nation’s27remoteness to become involved and knowledgeableabout our needs and aspirations. The United States hasprovided in-country diplomatic representation andyears of support for our vital democracy.Japan has also provided in-country diplomaticrepresentation and invaluable assistance. Like theUnited States  Japan has been steadily involved inPalau’s development  and I would submit that thisspecial familiarity with Palau’s people has enhancedJapan and the United States every bit as much as it hasaided Palau.Palau has been disappointed by the failure of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session toaccomplish Security Council reform  particularlybecause Japan’s deep knowledge of our region wouldinform Council members who have less familiaritywith the situation of the Pacific islands. We supportedand continue to support therefore the Group of Fourresolution and hope that the sixtieth General Assemblywill finish this critical work that was begun last year.A third steady supporter of Palau’s developmenthas been the Republic of China on Taiwan. Wecontinue to assert that the world would be benefited byTaiwan’s membership in this august body. This yearPalau was a sponsor of a resolution calling for aproactive role for the United Nations in addressing therising tensions in the Taiwan Strait. We regret that thedebate on that important resolution was foreshortenedin the General Committee and that we were preventedfrom expressing our views on this topic; however weare glad that we have an opportunity to do that now.The people of the Pacific  and the Pacific islandnations themselves  are under-represented in theSecretariat and in the governing bodies  commissionsand tribunals of the world. Our cohesive and effectiveregional group  the Pacific Islands Forum  is mostfortunate in having Australia and New Zealand amongus. But it is time  we submit  for the new island nationsto take a more active role and to share their unique andgraceful Pacific way with the rest of the world. It isquite possible  I submit  that the islands aremarginalized in part by the irrational composition ofthe regional groups. Strengthening the United Nationsshould include a realignment of the groups to betterreflect the proliferation of Pacific countries  which hasoccurred in the last 20 years  and the actual geographyof the world. This would allow the island nations tocompete more effectively for seats on major bodies.For this reason  Palau suggests the reform of thesystem and the creation of an East Asia and PacificGroup and that this group include  of course with theirconsent  our friends in Australia and New Zealand."
"133",5649,"PNG",60,2005,"Ibring greetings and congratulations to the President ofthe General Assembly from the Government and thepeople of Papua New Guinea on the occasion of thesixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. I pledge mydelegation’s support in the discharge of his nobleresponsibilities. I would like to commend again HisExcellency Mr. Jean Ping  Foreign Minister of Gabon for his stewardship of the work of the fifty-ninthsession of the General Assembly. I also pay tribute tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and his stafffor their continued efforts in servicing the needs ofMember States.At the outset  I would like to convey the heartfeltsympathy and condolences of the people of Papua NewGuinea to the Government of the United States ofAmerica and its people with respect to the loss of livesand the destruction of property in the Gulf states. Wewish them well for a speedy recovery and in theirreconstruction efforts.The United Nations has come a long way since itsinception in 1945. The focus on international peace andsecurity remains relevant  although since then it hastaken on new and different dimensions  including theevil of global terrorism.The process of reform of the United Nations particularly the General Assembly  the SecurityCouncil and the Secretariat must be reflective of thechanging landscape of today’s international realities.The membership of the Security Council  bothpermanent and non-permanent  must be expanded toinclude equitable representation from developingcountries. Work on the reform agenda  as set out in theoutcome document (resolution 60/1) of the High-levelPlenary Meeting  must commence without any furtherdelay. We strongly support the early resolution of allthe outstanding issues  including those related tohuman rights and to disarmament.Convening the recently concluded summitenabled us to see how much progress we have made inthe implementation of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs) in our respective countries. Despite theGovernment’s efforts to achieve the MDGs  PapuaNew Guinea’s scorecard indicates that much moreneeds to be done. We recognize that combatingpoverty  HIV/AIDS  child and maternal mortality andunemployment and promoting universal primaryeducation and gender equality are major challenges forPapua New Guinea.Important legislative  policy and administrativeinstruments are now being put in place. TheMillennium Development Goals and targets have beenincorporated into our medium-term developmentstrategy  which ties the MDGs to our developmentprogrammes through the national budgetary process. Iam happy to report that in July of this year the PapuaNew Guinea National Parliament endorsed acomprehensive national MDG report  compiled withthe kind assistance of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP). This now paves the way forconcrete efforts at all levels of Government and by allrelevant stakeholders to implement itsrecommendations.We are extremely concerned about the spread ofHIV/AIDS in our country. Papua New Guinea has thehighest incidence of reported cases in the Pacificregion. Important national legislation and policies havebeen put in place to address all aspects of that scourge.These include placing the National AIDS Councildirectly under the auspices of the Prime Minister’sdepartment. Papua New Guinea therefore fullysupports the efforts of the United Nations and theinternational community to address that scourge. Wesupport in particular the leadership of the Secretary-General in mobilizing international resources for theGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malariaand to combat other diseases.Our development partners  including Australia New Zealand  UNDP  the Joint United NationsProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and other UnitedNations agencies  continue to support Papua NewGuinea’s efforts to address this critical issue. While weappreciate such valuable assistance  it must becoordinated effectively within the medium-termdevelopment strategy policy framework if it is to havemaximum impact.30International finance  especially foreign directinvestment and overseas development assistance  arevital instruments that can help developing countriessuch as mine to achieve the MDGs and otherinternational commitments and obligations. OurGovernment is therefore committed to attractingforeign direct investment to assist us with developmentefforts in our country. At the same time  overseasdevelopment assistance must be used effectively  asmeasured against achievement of the nationaldevelopment goals and priorities set out in themedium-term development strategy.While Papua New Guinea has a good debt-servicing record  debt repayments still placeconsiderable strain on our ability to provide much-needed services to our people. They affect thecountry’s ability to implement the MDGs  the outcomeof the World Summit on Social Development and otherimportant development commitments.Papua New Guinea commends the EuropeanUnion’s assistance to help highly indebted poorcountries (HIPC) with their debt servicing difficulties.Consideration  however  must also be given to othernon-HIPC countries  such as mine  so that they canbenefit from such goodwill and assistance. In thiscontext  we support the proposal by PresidentMacapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines to extend debtservicing assistance to highly indebted non-HIPCdeveloping countries  including Papua New Guinea under a debt-for-equity swap arrangement.Trade is the engine of economic growth anddevelopment. It is a critical prerequisite for sustainedefforts to achieve socio-economic development including the MDGs. Papua New Guinea washeartened to hear some leaders of major developed anddeveloping countries at the summit indicating firmcommitments to address the current distortions oninternational trade regarding the elimination ofagricultural subsidies and other trade barriers. That is apositive signal of a move towards the creation of anopen  equitable and rule-based international tradingsystem.The ongoing Doha round of negotiations  as wellas the economic partnership agreement negotiationsbetween the European Union and the African Caribbean and Pacific countries must place greateremphasis on development. The particular developmentneeds of small island developing States — the result oftheir physical and structural disadvantages — mustalso be given priority in the negotiating process.As a young democracy  Papua New Guinea iscommitted to fighting corruption and upholding theprinciples of good governance and the rule of law.Corruption  in particular  is the main impediment toprogress and development in developing countries suchas Papua New Guinea. The victims of corruption arethe poor  who are deprived of basic goods and services.That is a great challenge for us  and we are determinedto combat it. Taking a step forward  Papua New Guineahas ratified the United Nations Convention AgainstCorruption. Other policies and administrative andlegislative measures have been put in place  along withexisting constitutional provisions on the leadershipcode governing the conduct of leaders.The illicit trade in small arms and light weaponsis a also a major threat to the peace and security of ourcountry. Small arms and light weapons almostdestroyed our country. The Bougainville crisis wasfuelled by large quantities of small arms and lightweapons. Papua New Guinea will seek the cooperationand support of neighbouring countries to put an end tothe traffic in small arms and light weapons to theregion. We therefore support the ongoing work at theUnited Nations to address that critical issue.The resolution of the Bougainville crisis was asuccess story for the United Nations in the history ofpeacekeeping efforts throughout the world. We thankthe United Nations — especially the Security Counciland the Secretary-General — and our friends in thePacific region  including Australia  New Zealand  Fiji Solomon Islands  Vanuatu and Tonga  for assisting usin concluding the peace process. Peace and normalcyare now being consolidated  with the election of thefirst Autonomous Government by the people ofBougainville. They must be strengthened throughsocial and economic development throughout theisland. Basic goods and services are being restored andthe infrastructure redeveloped on the island  but wewill require the continued support of the internationalcommunity in those efforts. We also look forward tothe assistance of the proposed PeacebuildingCommission in such endeavours.Papua New Guinea  like many other small islanddeveloping States  suffers from natural disasters  suchas volcanic eruptions  floods  cyclones  landslides droughts and even tsunamis. The ongoing and never-31ending cycle of natural disasters continues to posegreat difficulties for Papua New Guinea’s achievementof social and economic progress  including itsachievement of the MDGs and other developmentobjectives. Papua New Guinea therefore supports theestablishment of early warning systems for all naturaldisasters and hazards.Papua New Guinea’s coexistence with theenvironment was enshrined in the preamble of ournational Constitution at the time of the country’sindependence in 1975. That constitutional imperativeguided our commitment to implement the sustainabledevelopment goals and objectives resulting from theRio Earth Summit  including the World Summit onSocial Development outcome  the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Developmentof Small Island Developing States and  more recently the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementationof the Barbados Programme of Action.Those multilateral commitments are vital if weare to ensure the proper management of our country’srich natural resources and address critical issues  suchas poverty eradication  climate change  sea-level riseand natural-disaster management.Legal and policy frameworks have been put inplace to enable us to pursue development in asustainable manner. Our Government is committed toundertaking economic development activities  such asmining  forestry and agriculture  in a sustainablemanner.We call upon the United Nations and theinternational community to recognize the weakest smallest and most vulnerable peoples of the smallisland developing States. The recently adoptedMauritius Strategy identifies certain commitments thatmust be fulfilled if we are to address the sustainabledevelopment and other development aspirations ofsmall island developing States. The internationalcommunity must  including at this General Assemblysession  translate those commitments into action through projects relating to water  sanitation andrenewable energy and by addressing training andcapacity-development needs. In this regard  we supportthe call for the mobilization of financial resources on amore predictable basis so as to implement the strategyas articulated in the summit outcome document.As a Member of the United Nations  weemphasize that all nations have a critical responsibilityto address climate change  including sea-level rise. Ifwe are to achieve lasting climatic stability  we musthave a global commitment to the objectives of theUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange. The relationship between environmentalsustainability and poverty is becoming increasinglyclear. Papua New Guinea is therefore of the view that when addressing tropical forestry  the world mustbetter align market incentives with sustainableoutcomes.In the forested rural areas of my country  the onlyreal options for economic growth often require thedestruction of natural forests — either when clearingfor agricultural commodities such as coffee  or throughthe sale of hardwood timber. Furthermore  theInternational Panel on Climate Change found that during the 1990s  an estimated 20 to 25 per cent ofannual global carbon emissions were generated throughland-use change  primarily from the degradation offorest resources. That is the second largest source ofglobal carbon emissions — second only to thecombustion of fossil fuels. That has to change if we areto take responsibility to help with issues related toclimate change.Papua New Guinea is part of a new Coalition forRainforest Nations  including Costa Rica and othercountries  and is requesting a global discussion onaccess for ecosystem services to the global carbonmarkets as a means to alleviate this problem. Simplyput  the present incentives offered by internationalmarkets for agriculture  forestry and emissionsreductions lead directly to deforestation  environmentaldegradation and further poverty. We invite more like-minded nations to join our efforts to create newmarkets and to reform outmoded market and regulatorymechanisms. That is necessary if we are to contributemore effectively to environmental sustainability economic development  climate stability and povertyreduction.Oceans and fisheries issues are critical to PapuaNew Guinea and to other Pacific island countries.Oceans and fisheries sustain the livelihood and well-being of our people and contribute significantly to oursmall economies. Sustainable development is a priorityfor Pacific island countries  including Papua NewGuinea. We are concerned about the ongoing illegalfishing activities in the region. We require the supportand assistance of development partners with technicalcapacities to strengthen our surveillance capabilities32and with regulatory regimes to address these issues ofvital importance.Papua New Guinea fully supports the entry intoforce of the Western and Central Pacific TunaConvention. Papua New Guinea welcomes anyassistance that United Nations agencies — includingthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the UnitedNations — and other bilateral and multilateral partnerscan provide to permit effective functioning of theConvention secretariat.The security of Pacific island countries dependson the collective security efforts of the region and ofthe wider Asia-Pacific region. Our regional securitycooperation is attested to in the successful missioncarried out by the Regional Assistance Mission to theSolomon Islands  organized under the aegis of thePacific Islands Forum.Papua New Guinea condemns internationalterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Oursupport in the fight against this evil is unwavering andresolute. We have ratified most of the counter-terrorismtreaties  pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373(2001). However  our efforts are being hampered bytechnical and resource constraints; hence the need forthe support and assistance of the internationalcommunity to ensure effective implementation of thosecommitments.Over the years  Papua New Guinea has called forbold decisions and leadership on the part of both Israeland Palestine to exercise restraint and resolve theirdisputes through peaceful means. We commend PrimeMinister Sharon and President Abbas for their bold andstrong leadership towards the resolution of this long-standing issue.We fully support the positive efforts being carriedout in Iraq and Afghanistan as democracy and the ruleof law take root. These will be enhanced througheconomic and social development as well as throughvital infrastructure development. Those efforts however  must be supported by the internationalcommunity.We are halfway through the Second InternationalDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism. Progressmust be made to ensure that all the remaining 16non-self-governing territories  including NewCaledonia  exercise their inalienable right to self-determination by 2010. We are following the positivedevelopments taking place in Tokelau  where theGovernment of New Zealand is helping the people tofreely exercise their right to self-determination.South-South cooperation among developingcountries is critical. It paves the way for enhancedtrade relations and cooperation in areas related to thetransfer of technology and know-how to address issuesaffecting those countries  including the fight againstHIV/AIDS and the eradication of poverty. Papua NewGuinea welcomes the establishment of the South Fundfor Development and Humanitarian Assistance and theGovernment of Qatar’s initial pledge to contribute $20million to the Fund. We commend the pledges by Indiaand China to contribute $2 million each to the Fund. Itis a significant step forward for developing countries toassist needy Members  including small island countrieswith vulnerable economies. We call upon thedeveloped countries to recognize this valuable effortand to provide support to the Fund.Papua New Guinea will assume the chairmanshipof the Pacific Islands Forum commencing in October.As Chair  Papua New Guinea will provide leadership inour collective efforts to address critical issues facingmember countries  including the adoption of thePacific Plan  which is built upon four main pillars namely regional security  economic growth  sustainabledevelopment and good governance in the region. Itmust become a vehicle for translating the MauritiusStrategy and the outcomes of the World Summit onSustainable Development and the High-level PlenaryMeeting into action on the ground in our respectivemember countries. We therefore welcome the supportof our development partners in the implementation ofthe Plan after its adoption at the upcoming Forummeeting to be held at Port Moresby  Papua NewGuinea  in October this year."
"134",5695,"POL",60,2005,"Let me begin bycongratulating President Jan Eliasson on his election.Allow me to assure him of Poland’s readiness tosupport him in his efforts during this session. I wouldalso like to join the European Union presidency — towhose statement we fully adhere — in expressing mywords of gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping forhis leadership during the preparations for the sixtiethanniversary summit.This year in Poland we are commemorating thetwentieth anniversary of the Solidarity movement. Inthe history of Europe since the Second World War there have been few events that can be celebrated witha similar sense of pride and satisfaction. The history ofSolidarity — and in particular its rebirth in 1989 —opened the way to profound historic changes in Europeand the entire world  including the fall of the BerlinWall and the collapse of the Communist bloc. I hopeand believe that Solidarity’s message still remains aninspiration not only for Poland  but also for the entireworld — wherever there are people who uphold oraspire to freedom and solidarity. In that spirit  I wouldlike to repeat our call to celebrate 31 August as a worldday of freedom and solidarity. In our opinion  globalsolidarity should be the central value in and the keytool for achieving a new sense of community andrealizing our common interests.Poland’s dedication to the concept of solidarityalso draws strength from the fact that Poland itselfbenefited from foreign aid and support. Today  we areundergoing an important transition in our status: fromaid recipient to donor. We hope that Poland’s activecooperation for development will serve as a catalyst forfurther change and help lay the foundation fordemocracy  sustainable development  human rights andthe rule of law.For us  however  the concept of responsiblesolidarity is not solely limited to humanitarianendeavours; it means more than assisting the poor andunderdeveloped. Solidarity is an operational principle which generates cooperative attitudes among countriesin need  including those plagued by terrorism  naturaland manmade disasters  weak State structures and othercalamities. Solidarity means rescue rather than relief remedy rather than alleviation. It should be driven byneed — not by right — and cut across dividing lines. Itis solidarity that can help to bridge religious andideological divides and overcome the difficult legacyof the past. Indeed  if we want to build a world withoutdivisions we must first suppress all disputes that feedon past grievances. We have to find a way to reconciledivergent points of view without sacrificing ourprinciples.The recently concluded High-level PlenaryMeeting was a product of enormous efforts to forge anew global consensus on development  security  humanrights and United Nations institutional reform. Theagenda of the summit was long and ambitious. Thepreparatory process  as well as the summit itself offered many insights  ideas and usefulrecommendations that merit further seriousconsideration. However  despite the greatdetermination and expectations  we failed to achieveunity in confronting all of the world’s most menacingproblems.The United Nations is a ponderous institution anddoes not embrace change easily. Thus  we should notexpect that each and every summit will provide us withrevolutionary changes. Real breakthroughs are usuallythe result of a lengthy process. Consequently  ouroutcome document should be regarded not as the endof reform  but as a guide for the further practical stepsthat need to be taken. In that context  I call onMembers to devise a plan to implement our summitdecisions and to submit it to the General Assembly foradoption. This time  we must break the vicious circleof inaction and ensure a proper follow-up to thesummit. Finding workable forms and mechanisms forcooperation has never proved easy and will remain aserious challenge for the months ahead.The United Nations operates in a constantlychanging international environment. We have alreadyidentified major new threats  risks and challenges: thefanaticism of international terrorism  the proliferationof weapons of mass destruction  organized crime States in crisis and failed States. Although we claim toknow their nature  we will never be quite able topredict how  where and when those threats willmanifest themselves. At the same time  such threatscannot overshadow the importance of addressing theirroot causes  such as development gaps  poverty  socialexclusion  natural disasters  discrimination andintolerance  among others.19We are passing through a transitional stage withall its strains and stresses. International institutions andmechanisms — designed to serve the old internationalsystem — must face the challenge of reform andaccommodation. The United Nations is not anexception. As a consequence  we have had to find waysand means to respond to the swiftly changing nature ofsecurity threats and risks. Thus  the challenge remainsthe same as for all of us: how do we manage thatchange?In this era of globalization and rapid change  nocountry alone can fully ensure its own security. Statesecurity is more than ever before dependent on externaldeterminants. What we need is an innovative andimaginative approach to security  both in the realm ofstrategy and in its constituent processes. Moreover  wehave to develop a new security paradigm according towhich the security of individuals is as important as thesecurity of States.Likewise  we need a new concept of sovereigntythat attaches greater importance to protecting the rightsof people than to the prerogatives of State power. Wemust place the human being at the centre of theactivities of international institutions.It is true that the first duty of a Governmentshould be to protect those living within its jurisdictionfrom genocide  mass killing and human rightsviolations. However  in certain instances  theresponsibility of the international community to takeaction must be ensured.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionis a longstanding problem that has afflicted theinternational community for many years. However  inthe light of the particularly threatening nexus ofterrorism and weapons of mass destruction  it has takenon a new dimension. No State is immune to it or isprotected from its consequences. At the same time existing systems of national control and internationalnon-proliferation agreements are not completelyeffective and are undermined by loopholes and lacunaewhich enable States and individuals to bypass theregime. It is all the more disappointing  therefore  thatthe United Nations summit failed to reach an outcomeon non-proliferation and disarmament.To address that challenge adequately  we have tostrengthen the three pillars of the nuclear-arms-controlregime: non-proliferation  disarmament and thepeaceful use of nuclear energy. We should  however ensure that it works in a harmonious and self-sustaining way.Another issue is that of enforcement. Legal normsthat are not effectively enforced obviously do not servetheir purpose. We have to seek ways and means toensure effective verification and to enforce respect forexisting non-proliferation and disarmament obligations.We cannot count solely on persuasion and containment.More fundamentally  we need a comprehensivereview of the existing negotiating machinery. With thatin mind  two methods of action are possible. Onewould be to establish a group of experts; the other —perhaps a better solution — would be to request that arespected international independent research centre —such as  for example  the Stockholm InternationalPeace Research Institute — prepare a report containingrecommendations on how to make existing UnitedNations institutions and mechanisms more effective operational and efficient.Our concerted efforts to strengthen the UnitedNations will be doomed to failure if we continue tobelieve that only security issues matter. They certainlydo matter  but security is a much broader concept. Itdoes not involve only the absence of hard or softthreats. It is  above all  about the absence of threats tofundamental human values. Likewise  the eradicationof poverty is essential not only to peace anddevelopment  but  first and foremost  to thepreservation of human rights and standards. Ensuringsocial justice and reducing inequalities do not involveonly the allocation of scarce resources to guaranteesecurity; they also presuppose both human freedom andhuman dignity.In that context  Poland welcomes the proposedchanges to the United Nations human rights machinery especially the decision to establish a Human RightsCouncil. We believe that such an organ would enableus to promote respect for human rights in a moreefficient and responsible way.We should also promote democracy through theUnited Nations in order to protect human rights andexpand democratic freedoms. No one can claim thatdemocracies are free of contradictions and injustices.But it is democracies that best serve to defend thevalues we want to protect and promote.In that spirit  on behalf of the citizens of Poland  Iwould like to reiterate our sincere and strong support20for the Democracy Fund  established to assist countriesin their transition to democracy. I truly believe that thisnew mechanism will help to address differences amongand within societies in a spirit of true respect andunderstanding.Poland’s commitment to the community of sharedvalues does not mean that we disregard the institutionaland technical aspects of reform. Institutionaladaptation should be characterized by openness transparency and effectiveness. These are precisely theprinciples that have guided us in the process ofanalysing Security Council reform and establishing thePeacebuilding Commission and the Human RightsCouncil.Reform of the Security Council is proving to bean enormously complex and divisive issue. Althoughnecessary  it should not be conducted at the cost ofcompromising the Council’s capacity to meet itsCharter responsibilities. The Republic of Polandbelieves that the effectiveness and efficiency of theSecurity Council rests on the assumption thatmembership not only grants additional privileges butalso increases responsibilities.Furthermore  Poland fully recognizes theimportance of the ongoing process carried out by theSecretary-General  which is aimed at enhancingeffective management of the Organization. We stronglyencourage continuing such efforts to strengthen UnitedNations accountability and its oversight mechanisms aswell as to promote the efficient use of its humanresources. System-wide coherence  particularlyregarding operational capabilities and humanitarianassistance  should be high on the reform agenda. Wehope that such an approach will enhance theOrganization’s capacity to carry out its new tasks andmeet its new challenges  thus enhancing the authorityof the United Nations and its role in the internationalsystem.Poland’s commitments in the framework of theUnited Nations are not made based on tacticalconsiderations. We are not calculating what we cangain from this or that choice. We do not expect to makepolitical profits or economic gains. But we share asense of solidarity and responsibility with respect notonly to our own country but also to the entireinternational community.A system based on values and principles may notbe perfect  but it is likely to be more peaceful and  inthe long run  more conducive and responsive to theneeds of peoples. In that spirit  I hope that thisanniversary session will provide a strong impetus torebuild the community of shared values and enable usto replace the global psychology of competition with aspirit of cooperation."
"135",5721,"PRK",60,2005,"On behalf of thedelegation of the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea  please allow me to congratulate you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of the sixtieth sessionof the General Assembly. I should also like tocongratulate your predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  Ministerfor Foreign Affairs of the Gabonese Republic  on hiscommendable work as President at the previoussession. I look forward to the successful outcome ofthis session. My appreciation also goes to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his tireless efforts aimed atreforming the Organization to bring aboutmultilateralism centred on the United Nations inconformity with the demands of the current changedsituation.Five years ago  when the Millennium Summitadopted its Declaration of peace  poverty eradicationand respect for human rights  humankind sincerelyhoped that  with the dawn of a new century  peace andprosperity would take hold around the world. However despite the adoption of that Declaration and theaspirations of humankind  the world is today beingdrawn further into a vortex of instability and fear dueto unilateralism and the highhandedness of the super-Power. On one side of the world  voices yearning forpeace  poverty eradication and sustainabledevelopment continue to grow; while on the other sideprovocative acts such as armed invasion and the threat27of pre-emptive nuclear attack are being committedopenly against sovereign States.In North-East Asia alone  with the Koreanpeninsula at its centre  adventurous military attemptscontinue unabated  aggravating tension in the region as does the strengthening of strategic militaryalliances  the large-scale introduction of highlysophisticated weapons and operational equipment  theestablishment of missile defence systems and UlchiFocus Lens-05 military exercises for pre-emptivestrikes.The current situation is becoming increasinglyacute due to arbitrariness on the part of unilateralistforces. That urgently requires that Member Statesundertake a joint effort to bring about multilateralismcentred on the United Nations on the basis of respectfor the principles of sovereignty  equality  territorialintegrity and mutual benefit.As is well known  peace and stability on theKorean peninsula are directly linked to peace andsecurity in the North-East Asian region and the rest ofthe world. As we have seen in recent years  thesituation on the Korean peninsula is once again part ofa vicious circle of tension and dÈtente that ispreventing the establishment of durable peace andstability. The primary cause for that lies in the nationaldivision forced upon us by foreign forces and theextremely hostile policy of the super-Power towardsthe Democratic People's Republic of Korea.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea'spolicy of Songun Jongchi - which is to say  to givepriority to military affairs - is aimed primarily atcoping with the attempts of the United States tosuffocate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which constitute a real threat. The Songun policyadministered by the respected General Kim Jong Il isthe basic safeguard for our sovereignty from theconstant threat of the United States and for preventinganother war on the Korean peninsula  thereby ensuringpeace and security in North-East Asia.This year  the north and the south of Koreatogether significantly commemorated the fifthanniversary of the announcement of the 15 June North-South Joint Declaration  as well as the sixtiethanniversary of Korea's liberation  thereby setting a newstage for the attainment of overall national unity andthe realization of the cause of national reunificationindependently and peacefully under the theme ìOurnation itselfî. The Government of our Republic willalso make every possible effort in the future to bringabout independent national reunification as soon aspossible  achieve lasting peace and stability on theKorean peninsula and bring about the nation's commonprosperity by thoroughly implementing the 15 JuneNorth-South Joint Declaration.With a view to facilitating better understandingon the part of Member States and making positivecontributions to the work of the current session  Iwould like to refer to the principled position andsincere efforts of our Republic regarding a fair solutionof the nuclear issue between the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea and the United States.The Government of our Republic has consistentlyadhered to its position of addressing the nuclear issuepeacefully  through dialogue and negotiations. Aseveryone knows  the nuclear issue is a direct product ofthe hostile policy of the United States against theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea during morethan half a century. Given that  driven by extremehostility towards the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea  the United States has gone as far as designatingour country as part of an ìaxis of evilî and making it apotential target for pre-emptive nuclear strikes  therebymilitarily threatening our security  our country hasbeen compelled to possess a self-defensive nucleardeterrent as a means of safeguarding our nationaldignity and sovereignty. In circumstances in which theUnited States  the sole world super-Power  is lookingdown on us and threatening to use nuclear weapons the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - acountry with a small territory and population - has noalternative but to possess a strong and legitimate meansof self-defence.As we have clarified time and again  the ultimategoal of the Democratic People's Republic of Koreawith regard to the nuclear issue is the denuclearizationof the Korean peninsula. The denuclearization of theKorean peninsula was called for by President Kim IlSung  the fatherly leader of our people. The 1992North-South Joint Declaration on the Denuclearizationof the Korean Peninsula and the 1994 AgreedFramework between the Democratic People's Republicof Korea and the United States are manifestations ofthe invariable political will of the Government of theRepublic to denuclearize the Korean peninsula by allmeans.28During the recent fourth round of six-party talksin Beijing  we approached discussions seriously andwith magnanimity and a principled  fair and above-board position to achieve our consistent final goal ofthe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula at anycost  thereby enabling the talks to come up with anagreement on the principles to that end as part of abroad framework to overcome all challenges. The jointstatement issued at that meeting reflects our principledposition on the resolution of the nuclear issue. At thesame time  it also clearly specifies the obligations ofthe United States and South Korea as the partiesresponsible for the denuclearization of the entireKorean peninsula.As we have clarified more than once  there willbe no need for the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea to keep a single nuclear weapon if relations arenormalized between our country and the United States bilateral confidence is built and the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea is not exposed to theUnited States nuclear threat any longer. What is mostessential at this stage is for the United States to providelight-water reactors to the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea as soon as possible as evidence ofthe former's substantial recognition of the latter's rightto peaceful nuclear activities.We shall watch closely how the United States actsin reality during the ìaction for actionî phase. Ourcountry's Government will continue to be patient andto do its best to bring about the denuclearization of theKorean peninsula.If the United Nations is to fulfil its mission toensure international peace and security and economicand social development  it should be reformed inconformity with the demands of the new century. Thatis the unanimous view of the international community.In that regard  it is important that we take amultilateral approach centred on the United Nationsand in line with the purposes and principles of theCharter. To that end  efforts should be made to  interalia  prevent unilateralism and high-handednessleading to violations of the Charter and of internationallaw  and to ensure that the functions and role of theUnited Nations in addressing major international issuesremain pivotal.Disputes should be resolved peacefully  throughdialogue and negotiation. The unilateral use of forcecan never be justified in any case. Such actions asauthorizing specific countries to launch pre-emptiveattacks on the pretext of preventing conflicts shouldnot be viewed as strengthening the collective securitysystem of the United Nations and should therefore berejected  as they are dangerous attempts to ignore boththe principles of non-interference in others' internalaffairs  as well as respect for sovereignty  as stipulatedin the Charter.Secondly  all important international issuesshould be addressed fairly and reasonably  in theinterests of the overwhelming majority of MemberStates. We should not allow them to be dominated ordealt with by the super-Power or by a few powerfulcountries. In this context  we have been consistent inour insistence on the establishment of a system thatmandates the General Assembly to review and endorseSecurity Council resolutions relating to sanctions andthe use of force that can affect international peace andsecurity.The Security Council should be reformed on thebasis of the principle of ensuring the full representationof the non-aligned and developing countries  whichmake up the overwhelming majority of Member States.We should never tolerate the permanent membership ofJapan  which refuses to liquidate its past crimes againstother countries  distorting its history of aggression anddriving the regional situation towards confrontation.The reform of the United Nations human rightsmachinery should take place in accordance with thedemands of the majority of countries. In reforming thehuman rights machinery  the Organization shouldconsider its most pressing task and ultimate goal to beputting an end to infringement on national sovereignty the politicization of human rights and the applicationof double standards and selectivity  which are the mostserious human rights violations at present. Like thereform of the Security Council  that reform effortshould be carried out on the basis of the principle ofensuring the full representation of the non-aligned anddeveloping countries that make up the overwhelmingmajority of the United Nations membership.If that principle is ignored  the reform of thehuman rights machinery will remain just empty talk.Worse still  if the establishment of the Human RightsCouncil is aimed at legitimizing the high-handednessof a few countries on the pretext of human rightsprotection  the discussion itself will be completelymeaningless.29The Government of the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea will continue to make an activecontribution to the efforts of Member States to build anew  peaceful and prosperous world by furtherstrengthening its friendly and cooperative relationswith all countries that respect our national sovereigntyin accordance with the ideal of independence  peaceand friendship."
"136",5766,"PRT",60,2005,"Iam returning to the Assembly Hall after 10 years. InSeptember 1995  I had the honour of being electedPresident of the General Assembly. I well know therefore  what a difficult task it is  and I congratulateyou  Mr. President  Ambassador Jan Eliasson  on yourrecent election. I wish you every success in dischargingyour lofty functions. I would also like to complimentthe outgoing President  Mr. Ping  on the exceptionalwork that he did during the previous session.I offer my best wishes to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan. My country greatly values theexcellent work that he has done so far  and thePortuguese Government wishes to express its solidaritywith him in connection with the difficult times that hasbeen through  as well as its continued support for theenormous tasks and challenges that lie ahead.We share some of the disappointment felt by theSecretary-General regarding the failure to approvemany of the proposed reforms of the Organization thathe set out in his excellent report  “In larger freedom”.The entire process started 10 years ago  in 1995-96 under my presidency  and I can assure the Assemblythat one year later  when I left office  there werealready many consensus-based solutions that couldhave been approved. But insufficient use was made ofthe 10 years that have since passed.We are left with the conviction that progresstowards sound reform will be viable only if itmaintains  as its reference  the objectives set out in theproposals of the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan.What is sound reform of the United Nations? Inmy opinion  such reform would fulfil  at least  thefollowing five prerequisites.First  such reforms must respect and reaffirm thefundamental principles and values of the Charter.Secondly  they must create better conditions for themaintenance and re-establishment of peace guaranteeing security and dealing with the offenders ineither case. Thirdly  they must include strong measuresin support of development so as to improve the livingconditions of the world’s poorest countries and reducethe enormous gap that exists between the countries ofthe North and those of the South.Fourthly  such reforms must promote democracy human rights and the rule of law  internationally  aswell as within each State. Fifthly  they must establish abasis and the necessary conditions for a betterunderstanding among peoples  for a dialogue amongcivilizations  for an understanding of cultural andreligious diversity  and for a spirit of tolerance cooperation and friendship among nations Governments and individuals.In addition to those five prerequisites  there isstill a need to consider reorganizing the Secretariat which is an important instrument for attaining theobjectives of the United Nations. Make no mistake: Ihave enough personal experience to be able to statethat the staff of this Organization is  generallyspeaking  highly competent  dedicated andprofessional. But we must all understand that  in alarge Organization such as this one  like in any other there will always be a need for constant modernization.Last week the United Nations reform was set inmotion. We must continue to work hard  year afteryear  phase by phase  with the energy and the spirit ofcompromise that is the hallmark of diplomacy andwhich must therefore not be absent from the “temple ofdiplomacy” that is the United Nations.24First and foremost  the tasks to be accomplishedin the coming months — which have Portugal’sunreserved support — will be to do what is necessaryto make the Peacebuilding Commission operational; toimplement the already approved concept of the“responsibility to protect”; and to establish the newHuman Rights Council.Development is an urgent task that cannot bepostponed. The poorest countries call for justice  andthey deserve it; the richest countries insist on a code ofethics  and they must therefore fulfil the duties thatderive from it.In that regard  Portugal fully endorses the visionexpressed and reaffirmed by the United Nations whichaccords priority to development — understood to becomprehensive development  as expressed in theMillennium Development Goals — and which isclosely linked to security and the rule of law.Democracy and security constitute the sine qua noncondition for effective  sustained and equitabledevelopment.In terms of official development assistance Portugal hopes to reach the agreed target of 0.51 percent of gross domestic product in 2010  in order topave the way to achieving the ambitious goal of 0.7 percent in 2015.The efforts of Portugal have been mainly — butnot exclusively — directed towards the least developedcountries  and sub-Saharan Africa in particular.We therefore reaffirm the need to pay active andcommitted attention to the special needs of Africa. Inthat way  we will fulfil effectively the commitmentsundertaken to strengthen cooperation with the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development and withregional and subregional organizations.The report of the Secretary-General rightlyreminds us that every country is primarily responsiblefor its own development  in a framework of goodgovernance  which is a prerequisite in this context.Basically  it is a matter of implementing theeighth Millennium Goal: to create a global partnership fordevelopment  whose importance in promoting a moreequitable and just world I would like to stress here.That is why I have no hesitation in stating that wemust remain actively committed to the implementationof the Millennium Development Goals  includingstrengthening action in priority areas. Our commonfuture is at stake  and I would like to take thisopportunity to announce that Portugal has decided tocontribute to the United Nations Democracy Fund.For Portugal  environmental concerns are a clearpriority; addressing them must promote  not detractfrom  development. In that domain  we will activelyparticipate in international efforts to combat climatechange  honouring our commitments and limitinggreenhouse-gas emissions  so that the European Unioncan attain the goals agreed in the context of the KyotoProtocol. We hope that the next Conference  to be heldin Montreal  will mark the launching of a negotiatingprocess on climate-related issues for the post-2012period.One of the most serious threats to peace andsecurity today is terrorism. It must be fought withresolve  within the framework of the rule of law andwith respect for human rights. There can be no doubtthat one of the aims of terrorists is to weaken anddistort even the most elementary of the universalvalues adopted by States and their peoples. Because weare fighting back in self-defence  they say that ouractions — theirs and ours — are morally equivalent.Portugal strongly rejects that view.There can be no ambiguity in fighting terrorism.We must be clear on this and state  quite bluntly  thatall acts that aim to kill or seriously injure civilians ornon-combatants are acts of terrorism.We believe that the United Nations provides aframework of reference for combating terrorism  andwe therefore urge that a global convention on terrorismbe adopted. Similarly  we welcome the counter-terrorism strategy drawn up by the Secretary-General and we appeal for its effective implementation.In that context  Portugal will sign theInternational Convention for the Suppression of Actsof Nuclear Terrorism during this session of the GeneralAssembly.We must recognize that the largest cluster ofthreats to international peace and security today lies inthe broader Middle East. Regardless of countries’positions on the Iraq war  it is now essential to do allwe can  based on the clear existing mandates of theUnited Nations  to see that peace  democracy andhuman rights triumph. That could take a number ofyears  as in Afghanistan.25Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  it isimportant that  taking advantage of the current positivemomentum  we hold serious negotiations aimed atreaching bilateral and multilateral agreements. Theroad map cannot be forgotten or indefinitelypostponed. Just as Israel has an unquestionable right tolive in peace within secure borders  the PalestinianState also has an unquestionable right to exist. Onlythrough what is called the two-State policy can there bepeace in the Middle East.As for Iran  I should like to stress and support theefforts of the European Union to avert  throughnegotiations  another dangerous case of nuclearproliferation. The international community as a wholeand the Iranian people themselves owe a great deal tothe intelligent approach of the European Union in thismatter. We are  and will continue to be  united insolidarity. Negotiations must continue.Portugal is committed to strengtheningcooperation among regions and civilizations in order topromote international peace and stability. Accordingly the high-level political dialogue between Europe andAfrica must be further strengthened  including throughthe convening of the Europe-Africa summit  towardswhich Portugal has been working tirelessly.I reiterate Portugal’s appeal to all interestedparties to join in our effort to re-launch the Cairoprocess  which we believe could be instrumental inestablishing that strategic partnership.I also wish to publicly place on record mycountry’s support for Spain’s Alliance of Civilizationsinitiative. The European-African dialogue is also adialogue among civilizations  as is the Ibero-Americanprocess  to which Portugal  Spain  Andorra and the LatinAmerican countries are committed. That process will beformalized at the Salamanca Summit in October.Over the past nine years  the dialogue among theeight States members of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries — which represents 200 millionpeople living in four continents — has been intensified with great success. Portugal participates in the dialoguewith countries from Europe  Africa  Latin America andAsia  a dialogue that it would like to see broadened asan indispensable tool for civilizations to live in peaceand not be at war.I would like to conclude by reaffirmingPortugal’s faith in the centrality  legitimacy andindispensable role of the United Nations. While notforgetting our setbacks  but learning from them so thatthey are not repeated  we should bear in mind ourmany successes. Timor-Leste  which is here with ustoday as a full Member State  is one example of aUnited Nations success story.In conclusion  I would like to remember the wisewords of our second Secretary-General  DagHammarskjöld  who said:(spoke in English)“The pursuit of peace and progress cannot end ina few years in either victory or defeat. Thepursuit of peace and progress  with its trials andits errors  its successes and its setbacks  can neverbe relaxed and never abandoned.”"
"137",5812,"PRY",60,2005,"At the outset  I would like to express the condolences ofthe people of Paraguay over the tragedy caused byHurricane Katrina. I express my Government'ssolidarity with the victims and with the Government ofthe United States  and I ask God to swiftly assuage thegrief of so many families.We are gathered here to commemorate thesixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. Six decadesis time enough to reflect on the historical process ofthis Organization and  above all  on the debateconcerning the relevance of reforming it. This reformis absolutely crucial and must be directed not only toset up standards that would regulate the capacity ofPowers to make war; it is of primary importance thatthe reform promote equitable economic development because in a selfish world  where the number ofsocietyís orphans grows daily  it will be very difficultto have global peace.Changes cannot be partial or superficial and mustnot merely satisfy the hegemonistic ambitions of a few.We need to govern globalization with democratically17agreed legal norms and bodies that  through theirinherent legitimacy  would have the authority to ensurecompliance with their regulations.It must be a desire for world balance  notfinancial clout within the Organization  that shoulddetermine the direction to be followed in the UnitedNations; otherwise  the power of money will prevailover the power of justice and the rights of peoples which would dangerously thwart the noble mission ofthe United Nations. This means that reform cannotdeepen divisions; that would be illogical. The Chartermust reassert the role of unity among diverse nationswhich  in spite of their differences  must live togetherand share their resources and values  which givedignity to the lives of men and women and of ourpeoples.Development in equity and democracy is theformula. But to reach this stage  we need moreinternational trade and cooperation. Lately a wall isrising to block our exports  while cooperation is beingwatered down ó or the little cooperation that remainsis undertaken unjustly or according to the mood ofthose involved. The old promise taken on by the richestnations to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross domesticproduct (GDP) to less developed countries has not beenrespected thus far  except for the honourableexceptions of Norway  Luxembourg  Denmark  Swedenand the Netherlands. But it is a hopeful sign that thePresident of the United States has said in this forum(see A/60/PV.2) that his Government is in a position toeliminate all the subsidies that cause backwardness andpoverty for peoples with emerging economies insofaras the other rich nations do likewise. That would be ofgreat benefit to people who are experiencing shortagesdue to the unfair international order that the Presidentof the United States himself mentioned  so that ourpeoples' democracy can be stable and sustainable.It is important to point out that between 1990 and2003 the rich countries increased their per capitaincome by $6 070  while during the same period  theirassistance per capita fell to one dollar; this reflects thegreat stinginess that prevails in the currentglobalization model. The United Nations has a primaryrole to play in humanizing that model.The subsidies granted by rich countries to theiragricultural sectors  as well as the assistance that theygive to each other  are a cruel paradox. That assistanceamounts to a little more than $1 billion annually andthe subsidies to a little less. That global policy - weakin terms of cooperation and perverse in terms oftrade - will end by undermining the emergingdemocracies in developing countries.We in Paraguay are deeply convinced of thosetenets. Our wish is to cooperate so that our noblepurposes will govern the new world order. In ourdomestic affairs  we have managed to reverse a longprocess of deterioration to achieve macroeconomicstability and political institutionalization. We areworking to increase growth and to strengthendemocracy through good governance  thereby tacklingand resolving our social problems in a way we hadnever done in the past.Today my country  Paraguay  is becoming anation in a predictable situation and one worthy ofinternational trust. We are not bound by any political oreconomic dogma. Rather  we are seeking to liberate ourpeople from crude fanaticism  from ideologicalprejudices  from political violence and from fatalism because we believe we are capable of forging our owndestiny in a world of greater brotherhood.Indeed  Paraguay is rich in developmentpotential. We have abundant natural resources: land water and energy. And  even more important  we havea young population that is highly motivated to grow  tolearn and to work. Even though our economy is stillsmall  we are adopting policies and plans to expand ourproduction  increase employment  improve domesticpurchasing power and increase exports. We are movingtowards an economy that can compete in terms of bothquality and innovation.Our country is among those States that lack directaccess to the sea. Tragically  Paraguay is landlocked which is a considerable obstacle to our aspiration tobuild an economy based on production andinternational trade. For that reason  we need to createspecial lending arrangements for landlockeddeveloping countries  ensuring them differentialtreatment in areas such as lower interest rates andlonger grace periods. Such measures could attenuatethe comparative disadvantages we feel as a result ofour geographical situations.Another dimension I would like to touch on is theimportance of new information and communicationtechnologies and of biotechnological and otherscientific research. The knowledge and use of thoseresources cannot be concentrated in the hands of the18few. They must be made universally available.Paraguay believes this to be a necessary prerequisitefor the growth of global competitiveness.Two years ago my Government inherited asituation of economic stagnation  recession  sterilepolitical antagonism  violence  growing poverty andweak and unreliable public institutions that led to timidsocial policies that were a long way from addressingthe Millennium Development Goals. Today we arerecovering political and macroeconomic stability democratic governance and  above all  trust in theParaguayan State and in our business sector. We havegreat challenges ahead of us  but  with faith in thecapacity of our people  we are tackling them to build amore just international order.The major challenges in my country are tacklingextreme poverty and health care  which affect theneediest sectors of the population: indigenous peopleand small farmers. To address those issues we havepromoted a rapid increase in spending for socialservices to put a stop to growing poverty. We arefinancing new programmes: a social protectionnetwork for vulnerable groups  with financial subsidieslinked to school attendance; in the field of health care a nutrition programme for pregnant women and forboys and girls at risk for malnutrition; large-scaleshipments of seeds for subsistence crops; the purchaseof land for small farmers  with a view to ensuringsocial peace; free medical care for all children underthe age of five; concessional electricity rates; and ascholarship programme for students from the mostvulnerable schools. With humility  but also with greatfaith in the future and in the international community democracy and freedom - we in Paraguay arebuilding a socially  fiscally and environmentallyresponsible State.In the international context  we join the appealfor a more just and humane world order in which theless developed nations are not condemned for all timeto discrimination  indifference and backwardness. Inorder to achieve those goals we have no alternative toan inclusive multilateralism that offers balance rationality and justice in international relations.We also condemn terrorism in all its forms. Webelieve that terrorism is a threat to civilized processesand to the imperatives of resolving conflicts andestablishing peaceful coexistence in the world in orderto ensure the development and prosperity of ourpeoples.Similarly  we reiterate  as we have done year afteryear  our formal support for Taiwanís inclusion in theUnited Nations  so that the brotherly and supportiveRepublic of China can have a place and become anintegral part of our Organization as a full-fledgedMember  in accordance with the principle ofuniversality and the norms of international law.In addition  my country is deeply concerned bythe instability and high prices in international oilmarkets  which militate against our hard-wonmacroeconomic stability. Our country has not escapedthe harmful impact of that phenomenon  given the mostunjust burden on society: inflation. We are makingevery effort to control inflation  because we know thathigh oil prices have a negative impact on economicgrowth and poverty reduction. Today  our Governmentis significantly subsidizing the price of oil  thusdepriving the State of major financial resources fornecessary social programmes.I would like to say at this meeting that Paraguayis suffering from a misapplication of internationaljustice. There is an attempt to prohibit payments to ourState from financial transactions carried out byrepresentatives of a corrupt dictatorship which  withthe complicity of a group of international banks  wantsto deprive us of resources that we desperately need forsocial peace in our country. We hope that theappropriate United Nations bodies will not permit thepeoples of developing economies to be deprived ofmajor resources through devious legal procedures. Wehope for justice in this area from internationalinstitutions.The United Nations must either change to leadand to take up the challenges of our time  or it will hidebehind a superficial change in order to survive and willbecome an accomplice in the regression of our peoplesand the perpetuation of backwardness. This is a crucialmoment that we are experiencing as leaders of ourcountries  sixty years after the creation of the UnitedNations and five after the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. We find ourselves at a crossroads with twopaths before us: one of injustice and indifference thatleads to a world that is increasingly poor  unfair andinsecure  and the other the path of far-reaching changethat leads to peace and global well-being.19I would like to express my hope that this historicsession of the General Assembly will obtain thecommitments and actions required to reduce andeliminate the suffering  abandonment and frustration ofthousands of millions of people and that our effortswill yield its expected fruits for the well-being ofmankind.I trust that God will give us the necessary wisdomand strength required to lead our countries along thepath of liberty  peace  development and justice."
"138",5831,"PSE",60,2005,"Unlike the Israeli Prime Minister  who a few days agotold the Assembly that he had come to the UnitedNations from Jerusalem  I - a native son of theland - was not able to come here from Jerusalem because East Jerusalem  the capital of Palestine  stillremains under Israeli occupation  despite the numerousUnited Nations resolutions in that regard. Theabnormal situation of the city  which is sacred to thethree monotheistic religions  is a clear indicator that wein the Middle East are  regrettably  still far from peace.Only when East Jerusalem is returned to its people when United Nations resolutions are completelycomplied with and implemented and when the leadersof both countries are able to come freely fromJerusalem  will we have truly achieved the peace thatwe have so long awaited.We are now at an important juncture that couldconstitute the beginning of the road to peace. Israel  theoccupying Power  has completed its disengagementfrom the Gaza Strip with its withdrawal of the settlers its dismantlement of the settlements there and thedeparture of the Israeli forces from that territory. In thenorthern West Bank  some settlers were alsowithdrawn  and four settlements were dismantled.The end of the colonial settlement of one part ofour land - regardless of how small it may be - is animportant development  as is the withdrawal of theoccupying forces from within that part. It is animportant development that resulted from thesteadfastness of our people and the growingrealization  locally and internationally  of theimpossibility of the continuation of the status quo. Werecognize that the disengagement required politicalboldness. But  more important than the disengagementitself  are the way in which it occurred and the context as well as the steps that will follow. That willdetermine whether the disengagement will take usfurther towards a comprehensive settlement and peace or whether it is actually a step imposed by the realitieson the ground and intended to facilitate thecontinuation of the occupation  the colonization of theWest Bank and the obstruction of a final settlement.For our part  we dealt positively with thosematters and exerted strenuous efforts to prepareourselves for assuming our responsibilities  tocoordinate the steps to be taken with the Israeli sideand to ensure a peaceful and safe atmosphere duringthe implementation phase. Indeed  we achievedreasonable results in that respect. Despite that fact however  the basic nature of the plan remains: it wasunilateral and did not take into considerationPalestinian interests and positions.Israel  the occupying Power  has left the GazaStrip completely devastated. Over the years  Israeldestroyed Gaza's infrastructure  economic capabilitiesand social fabric  as well as the Palestinian Authority'ssecurity apparatus. Even the areas that had been underthe control of its settlements were almost totallydestroyed by Israel when it withdrew and left behindpiles of rubble  which in itself constitutes aserious problem economically  environmentally andpsychologically. Another problem was that Israel leftbehind  and did not dismantle  what it called houses ofworship - which were not supposed to be there tobegin with - in total disregard of its legal obligationto return the land to its original condition prior to theoccupation.Furthermore  since the disengagement  the GazaStrip has remained under the control of Israel  whicheffectively continues to control the airspace  theterritorial waters and the borders  thus continuing itscontrol of the movement of persons and goods into andout of Gaza. For that reason  and in the light of theprinciple of the unity and territorial integrity of theoccupied Palestinian territory  the Israeli occupation ofthe Gaza Strip has not ended and the legal status ofGaza has not changed: it remains part of the Palestinianterritory occupied since 1967  including EastJerusalem.Overall  Israel's occupation and colonization ofthe Gaza Strip constitutes one of the worst injustices inrecent history. In addition  it must be clear that theGaza Strip - which comprises only 6 per cent of thearea of the occupied Palestinian territory and which is30the most densely populated area in the world - cannotattain economic or political sustainability in isolationfrom the West Bank: without a permanent link to theWest Bank  without freedom of movement and withouttangible political progress and similar steps takenthere.What Israel is doing in the West Bank particularly in East Jerusalem  is cause for us to beeven more pessimistic. Israel has continued itsconstruction of the wall in disregard of theunprecedented 9 July 2004 advisory opinion of theInternational Court of Justice and resolution ES-10/15of the tenth emergency special session of the GeneralAssembly in that regard. As everyone can see  Israelhas persisted in committing this grave crime continuing to seize Palestinian land and attempting toannex it de facto  thereby destroying the livelihoods oftens of thousands of Palestinians  isolating them andimposing on them a totally different way of life and anunacceptable political situation.Israel  the occupying Power  has also continuedto establish and expand settlements. It has even devisedthe so-called E-1 plan to seize the whole of EastJerusalem and connect it to the Maale Adumimsettlement  thereby severing the West Bank into twoseparate parts. All of the foregoing not only is unlawfuland inhuman  but will also destroy any hope for asettlement and peace based on the two-State solution.The central mission for the internationalcommunity now  if we wish to safeguard the future ofthe Middle East and maintain the prospects for peace is to bring about a real and complete cessation of allsettlement activities and of the construction of the walland to enforce the rule of law  the advisory opinion ofthe International Court of Justice and relevant UnitedNations resolutions. That must be our central mission and whether there is political progress or not  we mustaccomplish it.But then  how are we to deal with the situationand move forward? First  we need to find rapidsolutions for the outstanding issues regarding the GazaStrip  including the Rafah crossing  the airport  theseaport  the removal of rubble from the Gaza Strip  andlinking Gaza to the West Bank. If we resolve thoseissues we may be able to change the living conditionsof the Palestinians there.Secondly  the Sharm el-Sheikh understandingsshould be implemented  particularly the Israeliwithdrawal from cities to pre-September 2000positions and the release of prisoners and detainees.This could bring about a new reality and begin theprocess of rebuilding confidence between the twosides.Thirdly  and in parallel with the aforementioned it is necessary to return to negotiations and beginurgently the implementation of the road map  whichlies at the heart of making political progress and is thepath to a resolution of the conflict. For our part  we areready to do this  and to begin final status negotiationsimmediately  as called for by President Abbas in hisspeech a few days ago. We hope that the Quartet willuse its influence to make that happen  and we also hopethat the international community as a whole represented by the United Nations  will provide theneeded support in that regard.Here we must stress the importance of theinternational assistance being extended to thePalestinian people and the Palestinian Authority. Wewould like to express our gratitude to all donorcountries for their important and considerablecontributions. In that regard  I would like to expressour appreciation as well for the role being played byMr. Wolfensohn and his team  in particular for rapidlyputting together an assistance programme for the GazaStrip and for promoting economic development in theentire occupied Palestinian territory. In that regard  theimportance of the Group of Eight (G-8) initiative mustbe emphasized  and we express our hope that all donorcountries will support it.We look forward to enjoying a dignified life likeall other peoples of the world; we look forward toexercising our right to self-determination and nationalindependence; we look forward to building ourinstitutions and to enjoying a democratic way of lifeand democratic governance; we look forward to apeace based on two States  Palestine and Israel  inconformity with the 1949 Armistice Line; and we lookforward to a just  agreed solution for the Palestinerefugees in accordance with resolution 194 (III).We have worked seriously to put an end to thecycle of military attacks and counter-attacks. Weundertook a national dialogue that led to a unilateraldeclaration of ceasefire  and that ceasefire has beenrespected despite Israel's obstructions andprovocations. That effort has led to an improvement inthe general atmosphere; it is incumbent upon both31parties to strengthen it. For our part  we will continueour national dialogue with a view to establishing apermanent and mutual ceasefire in the occupiedPalestinian territory  including East Jerusalem  whilereaffirming the right in principle of the Palestinianpeople to resist occupation and to self-defence. Wemust also reach a commitment by all Palestiniangroups for a complete cessation of the targeting ofcivilians in Israel  which we have repeatedlycondemned and which we view as harmful to ournational interest.Moreover  we will continue to exert efforts toimpose law and order and to enhance our politicalsystem on the basis of real democracy  encompassingpolitical pluralism and elections at all levels  includingmunicipal and legislative elections. Israel must stop itsattempts to interfere in and sabotage those elections.We will also continue to advance the development ofour national institutions in various fields and willcontinue to try to rebuild the Palestinian economy andto improve living conditions. We must do thatcomprehensively throughout the occupied Palestinianterritory  including  of course  in the Gaza Strip  whichhas suffered the most extensive destruction. We shallexert our utmost efforts to achieve those goals  eventhough we realize that they are really the tasks of post-conflict reconstruction and that no other people hasrealized such goals while still under occupation.Our achievements will inevitably be limited since Israel  the occupying Power  still controls mostaspects of everyday life in the territories. Any progressin that regard will remain directly and organicallylinked to the achievement of real progress in theresolution of the conflict and the achievement of acomprehensive settlement between the two parties.It seems that Israel and some of its friends nowfeel that they have succeeded in imposing many illegalconditions on the ground and in creating a degree ofvagueness regarding some aspects of the conflict. Inthat way  they feel that they have an opportunity toundermine the legal foundations of the question ofPalestine  to undermine international legitimacy and toerode the neutrality of the United Nations. We  incontrast  believe that situations created illegally willnot stand. We affirm that the facts are clear andindisputable  that justice and the rule of law willeventually prevail over force and that the UnitedNations - the embodiment of the internationalcommunity - will not forsake its responsibilities andwill not relent in the face of continuous violations ofits resolutions.We hope that the Israeli authorities will begin toseriously rethink their policies and positions instead oftrying to market them in the United Nations and inother international forums. We hope that they willdeclare their respect for United Nations resolutions andtheir readiness to implement them  rather than blamingthe United Nations for adopting those resolutions. Thatwill be the start of the solution and the start of a finalpeaceful and permanent settlement  which must bebased on law  international legitimacy and UnitedNations resolutions."
"139",5877,"QAT",60,2005,"Itgives me great pleasure at the outset to extend to you Mr. President  our congratulations upon your electionto the presidency of this sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly. We wish you every success in dischargingyour functions. I would also like to extend thanks andappreciation to your predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Jean Ping  for his valuable efforts in conductingthe work of the Assembly’s fifty-ninth session especially his efforts to reach a consensus on the finaldocument of the world summit of 2005.I would also like to thank His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  for his tireless efforts to strengthen the role ofour international Organization.World leaders who met at United NationsHeadquarters to follow up on the outcome of theMillennium Summit and the coordinated and integratedimplementation and follow-up of the outcomes of themajor United Nations conferences and summits in thesocial  economic and related fields have managed toadopt a document that calls for implementing reformsin the United Nations and for taking bolder collectivesteps to combat poverty  achieve development establish international security and uphold humanrights.The world today is experiencing extremelydifficult economic conditions which pose a real threatto the process of social and economic development inthe developing countries  especially the least developedcountries  and pose a major threat to the developmentof their peoples. That situation is the result of suchfactors as a decline in official development assistance;unfair international terms of trade; the imposition ofrestrictions on the access of their exports to worldmarkets; unfair prices for their commodity exports; aheavy external debt burden; and the adverse effects ofglobalization.Despite the progress made in many fields ofinternational cooperation  the problems of hunger poverty and such diseases as AIDS  malaria andtuberculosis have taken on horrific dimensions andcontinue to pose major challenges to the internationalcommunity. Unless the latter makes concerted effortsto accelerate equitable development in the developingcountries  especially the least developed countries  theMillennium Goal of halving poverty by 2015 willremain elusive.The international community  by resolving  at theMillennium Summit  to declare war on poverty bylaunching an ongoing campaign to make the right todevelopment a reality for all peoples  has made animplicit commitment to creating a social  economic andpolitical environment in the developing countries especially the least developed countries  that would bemore favourable to the translation into concrete realityof the right to development for all of their peoples.That would provide cohesion and equitable socialintegration for their societies as well as a realopportunity to eradicate poverty  enabling them toenjoy full  productive and gainful employment. Theinternational community also resolved at theMillennium Summit to seek to achieve a fair and justglobalization that embraces everyone  in order to sparethe developing countries  especially the least developedcountries  the danger of being marginalized within theinternational economy.At the Millennium Summit  world leadersaffirmed that international cooperation was the mostimportant factor in making the world a better place tolive in. They also affirmed that free trade liberalization of the economy and interdependence arethe best means to accelerate equitable economicdevelopment in the developing countries.The international community is at a critical stageof the negotiations related to the Doha DevelopmentAgenda. Those negotiations made concrete progresslast year in some difficult and controversial areas.Agreement was reached on the launching ofnegotiations regarding the question of tradeconcessions  one of the four questions which were left 38by agreement  outside the scope of the DohaProgramme of Action: investment  competition  tradeand environment and trade concessions. However  thatagreement by the developed countries was  regrettably conditional on the non-holding of negotiations on theother three questions.We are looking forward to the achievement ofsolid  ambitious progress at the sixth World TradeOrganization Conference in Hong Kong  and we hopethat we will be able to conclude negotiations in 2006.The developing countries have fulfilled theirpledges  and we hope that the upcoming negotiationsregarding the implementation of the outcome of thissummit will translate into reality the global partnershipfor the achievement of the internationally agreeddevelopment goals. We hope that the right todevelopment will become a living reality and that thedeveloped countries will honour their pledges including increasing official development assistance to0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product  and willaccelerate the process of forgiving the external debt ofall poor countries.We have often stated that peace in the MiddleEast can be achieved only through the implementationof the resolutions of the Security Council and of theGeneral Assembly. All of those resolutions recognizethe legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  foremostamong which is the right to self-determination and tothe establishment of their independent State on theirnational soil  with Al-Quds as its capital; withdrawalfrom the occupied Golan Heights up to the border of4 June 1967; and full withdrawal from the rest of theLebanese territories still under occupation.On that basis  the international mediation processproduced the road map  which affirms the principle ofland for peace and calls for the withdrawal of Israelfrom the occupied territories and the establishment ofthe State of Palestine.The Arab summit  meeting in Beirut in March2002  endorsed an international initiative calling forthe normalization of relations between the Arab Statesand Israel in return for Israel’s withdrawal to the 1967border.The Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip is animportant and positive first step  which  we hope  willbe followed by similar steps in all the Palestinianterritories and the other occupied Arab territories  inaccordance with internationally binding resolutions andthe relevant initiatives and agreements  in order tobring about stability  security and a comprehensive andjust peace for all States and peoples of the region.I cannot fail to mention the difficult conditionsexperienced by the fraternal Iraqi people. We hope thatthe new constitution will embody the hopes andaspirations of the Iraqi people and contribute to theestablishment of security and stability in the country.We hope also that it will take into consideration theinterests of all segments of the Iraqi population  that allthe people will feel that they all are part of theestablished system  and that the unity and the nationalidentity of Iraq will be preserved.Believing as it does in the great importance of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) to international peace and security  the State ofQatar has acceded to the Treaty and calls from thisrostrum on all States to do so. It also seeks to transformthe Middle East region into a zone that is totally freefrom all kinds of weapons of mass destruction.My country has unambiguously condemnedterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It has alsosupported all Security Council resolutions related tothe question of terrorism  and it has cooperated withthe international community in implementing thoseagreements. However  we feel that success ineradicating that phenomenon requires that we deal withits underlying causes  including the social  economicand political aspects that provide a fertile breedingground for terrorism.We also support the idea of convening aninternational conference on terrorism and of drawingup an international strategy to combat it. In thatcontext  we feel that defining terrorism and clearlydistinguishing it from the struggle waged by peoples inexercise of their legitimate right to defend theirfreedom and enjoy self-determination must be the mostimportant norm and enjoy international consensus.This is a right that is enshrined in all internationalnorms and practices.Our world today more than ever needs acomprehensive authority and frame of reference that isqualified to perform its role as an internationalinstrument; one that seeks to achieve internationalcooperation in resolving international problems of asocial and economic nature  as well as consolidatingsecurity and stability  maintaining international peace 39and enhancing respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms for all. Moreover  we mustearnestly seek to respect this global diversity  protect itand allow it to prosper.Hence  we feel that the proposal to establish astanding Human Rights Council  with a smallermembership  to be elected by a two-thirds majorityonly  merits further study in serious intergovernmentalnegotiations  with a view to achieving consensus on theestablishment of the proposed Council  its membership its mandate  and the organ destined to be its parentbody  which we hope will be the General Assembly.We must commit ourselves to human rights  asenshrined in the United Nations Charter  and we mustfully comply with internationally recognized humanrights standards.The question of expanding the Security Counciland the concept of collective security require furtherstudy and intergovernmental negotiations so as toarrive at a consensus on these important questions.In this context  we support the Secretary-Generalon the question of reforming the United NationsSecretariat for the reasons indicated in his reportentitled “In Larger Freedom”. However  we feel thatany proposals to reform the Secretariat are extremelyimportant and must be the subject of careful study discussion and negotiation by the General Assembly."
"140",5923,"ROU",60,2005,"Iwould like to add Romania’s voice to those who havewarmly congratulated His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliassonon his election to the important position of President ofthe General Assembly. We wish him every success andassure him of our full support.For Romania  the political debates at the sixtiethsession of the General Assembly have specialsignificance; during this session  we shall celebrate 50years of presence and active participation in thecommon efforts of the United Nations for peace security and sustainable development  to helppopulations in distress and to promote human rights. Itis uncontestable that the present international situationrequires not only that we take a hard  critical look atreality but also that we have the strength to takeresponsible decisions and strong measures  bothpolitically and at the institutional level  to ensure thatthe United Nations will be capable of meeting thechallenges of the twenty-first century and that it willcontinue to play an important role in the service of thegreater good.(spoke in English)Romania aligns itself fully with the statementdelivered at the 9th plenary meeting by ForeignSecretary Jack Straw of Great Britain on behalf of theEuropean Union. In my address I will  therefore  onlycomplement the key points already made there on thechallenges of reform. We can be proud of where theUnion stands today on the global scene and of itsUnited Nations record.By no means is this just another general debate atthe start of a new session of the General Assembly. Weare called upon to rise to the responsibility enunciatedat the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General32Assembly  which preceded these debates. There  headsof State or Government committed all of us  throughthe 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1)  tocontinue the efforts to reform our Organization. It isnow in our hands to implement our leaders’ decisionsand make the most of them.Against this backdrop  I wish to commendMr. Jean Ping  President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-ninth session  for the outstanding work he hasdone over the past few months  together with hisfacilitators  and for the way he conducted thenegotiations. It was a difficult process  but I believethat we have a document with which we can besatisfied. Many aspects still need further elaboration but the General Assembly is ready to work on themunder the skilful guidance of the current President Mr. Jan Eliasson.The United Nations should continue toaccomplish multilayered objectives and to function as acomplex  effective organization. That is the spirit ofthe deliberations conducted by our heads of State orGovernment and of the decisions they took.Much thus remains to be done in relation to themandate and responsibilities of the First Committee.Debates on international security are still dependent onarrangements put in place during the cold war.Unfortunately  almost all multilateral negotiatingforums seem complacent in their conservatism. Yet weall agree that  given those premises  it is difficult toadvance the political dialogue and to set new priorities.We need a new dynamic  anchored in a genuinereform process. It has to be tailored to respondeffectively to the most ominous threats to internationalpeace and security: terrorism and the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. It has to be truly relevantto our needs and has to produce equal dividends for allin a system based on the concept of collective security.Success in the area of development calls forbroad solidarity in international economic relations.Romania has gradually increased its contributiontowards resolving global development issues. Andaccession to the European Union will make Romania amember of the world’s largest donor community. TheUnited Nations must develop and strengthen itscapacity to effectively protect and promote humanrights and fundamental freedoms  by upholding theconcept of a “responsibility to protect”  which calls foran international response in cases where a State isunable or unwilling to discharge its primary function ofprotecting the life  property and fundamental rights ofits own citizens.This imperative is convincingly illustrated by thefact that  over the past 15 years  we have witnessedhow a number of internal conflicts  which frequentlyhad started as separatist movements  have evolved toachieve “frozen conflict” status. These conflicts havebecome breeding grounds for egregious violations ofhuman rights and abuses  targeting the most vulnerablecategories  such as women  children and personsbelonging to various minorities.It serves no purpose to debate an ambitiouspolicy agenda unless we have an effective UnitedNations system adapted to the new realities of achanging world. Years after the end of the cold war  theUnited Nations is still struggling to make the transitionfrom an organization characterized by ideologicaldifferences to one actively responding to pressingoperational challenges. Institutional change is anabsolute prerequisite for successful policy results.One of the main problems besetting theOrganization could  unfortunately  end up by beingperpetuated — that is  increasingly high expectationsand demands  without adequate resources andappropriate managerial tools.At a time when some are calling into question therelevance of our Organization and when we have hadto cope recently with a succession of revelations aboutmismanagement  we  the Secretariat and MemberStates together  need to act resolutely to ensure theefficiency and credibility of the United Nations byimproving administrative performance  establishingviable mechanisms for the responsibility andaccountability of the Secretariat  strengthening auditand oversight functions and endowing the Secretary-General with the authority and flexibility needed tomanage effectively the mandates entrusted to him bythe membership.For Romania  like other United NationsMembers  the Security Council has continued to be thebody that monitors international relations with regardto critical issues that pose a threat to regional andglobal peace. It is highly commendable that theSecurity Council has assumed the leading role inestablishing early warning and resolve as thecornerstones of the United Nations and the33international community’s approach to the full range ofnew threats to international peace and security.With over 2 000 peacekeepers on duty around theworld  Romania is a major contributor and a significantinvestor in a wide range of United Nations-mandatedand United Nations-authorized operations; wetherefore have a very high stake in their successfuloutcome.Romania’s stance has consistently been thatprotection against security threats means more than justtaking a stand at one’s own border; we have to gowhere those challenges originate and approach themwith resolute action and sustained investment. This ispart of the rationale for Romania’s joint endeavourswith partners and allies in shouldering stabilization andreconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. In bothcountries  elections are happening  following thetremendous dedication and painstaking efforts of above all  the people of those countries  and alsobecause of a steadily engaged international community.Romania is carrying her share of this burden all theway through the process.Since 9/11  the international edifice  as well asour common values of peace and security  have beenbadly shaken by an unprecedented surge of terroristactivity. Romania was among the first countries toembark on efforts undertaken globally  as well asregionally  to combat this scourge. From that day on we have constantly been at the forefront of the fightagainst terrorism  on the ground and through our activeparticipation in the process of shaping successiveinitiatives in different forums.Furthermore  Romania has carried out herspecific contribution to international counter-terrorismefforts as an elected member of the United NationsSecurity Council by assuming  inter alia  thechairmanship of the Committee established pursuant toresolution 1540 (2004) on the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction.Romania has already advanced to the ratificationstage of the 12 relevant international conventionsadopted in this area and has transposed important partsof their provisions into its national legislation. I amproud to inform delegates that  on 14 September  myPresident signed the International Convention for theSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism  which wasadopted by the General Assembly on 13 April 2005.Romania shares the European Union (EU) stand on theurgency of adopting of a comprehensive convention oninternational terrorism during the sixtieth session of theGeneral Assembly.Our crucial aim is to see the day when theinternational community is able to address each andevery security challenge  no matter where  by betterpooling existing resources and capabilities.We were pleased to see recognition given in theSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) to the importantcontribution that regional organizations have made topeace and security.The heads of State and Government expressedtheir support for a stronger relationship between theUnited Nations and regional organizations  underChapter VIII of the Charter. They resolved to expandthis dimension of the new architecture of internationalpeace and security through formalized agreementsbetween the respective secretariats and  as appropriate the involvement of regional organizations in the workof the Security Council.Romania’s particular experience in South-EasternEurope and the Black Sea area indicates that  in suchcases as conflict management and in handlingresponses to transnational threats  regional actionreinforced by meaningful cooperation between theUnited Nations and regional organizations is decisive.In the Balkans  the way in which the Kosovoissue will be addressed over the coming months isgoing to be crucial for the overall prospects for lastingstability  integration and prosperity for the wholeregion. The United Nations-led policy of standards inKosovo has improved the situation in the region. Theprobability of violence and conflict is lower now thanin the past  and we can start looking more confidentlytowards the future. However  the job is not yet done.Serbs and other ethnic communities in Kosovo stillfear for their security and cannot live normal lives.There are also too many who are still waiting to returnto their homes. Therefore  the comprehensiveimplementation of standards must continue  withthorough consideration given to securing andprotecting normal relations between ethniccommunities  as well as to the rights and freedoms ofall people from Kosovo. No one will be able to referrealistically to stability and a political settlement in theregion  as called for in United Nations SecurityCouncil resolution 1244 (1999)  until such afoundation is achieved.34East of Romania  in the wider Black Sea area development is hampered by a lack of overall securityand stability. I am referring particularly to thesituations of protracted conflict in the region  frozen ina state of uncertainty and disregard for internationallaw and scrutiny. Besides their negative impact ondevelopment and political normalcy  these conflictareas also spread modern maladies in theneighbourhood  such as organized crime  illegal armsand drug trafficking  trafficking in human beings  and not least  terrorism. The States of the region have torise to meet these challenges together. They will not beable to do so without close cooperation. They needstrong partners  strategic vision and a coherent  morecomprehensive approach. It is clear that we have tofind something better and more sustainable than tryingto put these conflicts in the freezer for decades oryears. In order to ensure the benefits of stability in thewider Black Sea area for all involved  the best way isto work towards making the logic of cooperationprevail.In November  Romania will take up thechairmanship of the Black Sea Economic Cooperationpact. In this capacity  Romania will try to encourage allplayers in the region to think strategically in thecommon interest and overcome the burden of theseprotracted conflicts so as to maximize the region’seconomic and social potential. Also  given the world’sinterdependence  the States of the region need a UnitedNations that has closer links to regional structures andthat can enhance  in turn  the effectiveness of jointaction.However we characterize the 2005 World SummitOutcome — as a blueprint or a road map — it isbeyond a doubt that United Nations reform is still awork in progress. As far as Romania is concerned  westand ready to join the presidency and all Membercountries in endeavours to prepare the United Nationsto meet the heavy demands placed on multilateralcooperation in the twenty-first century."
"141",5969,"RUS",60,2005,"In no way can today’s discussion be calledroutine. We are faced with summing up the preliminaryresults of the large-scale United Nations reforms thathave been launched and designating the main thrust forthe work of the entire system of United Nationsinstitutions in implementing the outcome document ofthe 2005 world summit. We propose to structure thework of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly insuch a manner as to facilitate the broadest possibleagreement on a number of conceptual issues related tostrengthening the United Nations that will  to a largedegree  determine our ability to enhance themanageability of international trends in an era ofglobalization  and better respond to its newaccompanying threats and challenges.An analysis of the experience of the UnitedNations over the sixty years of its existence  with allthe vagaries of the post-war  cold war and post-coldwar world order  gives us much food for thought andmany conclusions. I would like to share some of thatwith you from the viewpoint of the Russian Federation.As the most representative internationalinstitution with a universal mandate  the UnitedNations has been and remains a major integrationfactor in global politics. The success of the UnitedNations is our success and its failures are our failures.But ultimately the balance of its work is  we believe definitely positive. It is primarily due to thisOrganization that we have managed to avoid a newthreat of  world war and a nuclear disaster and havebeen able to prevent and settle dozens of militaryconflicts. At present  the United Nations mechanismscontinue to be a means of constructive cooperationtouching upon all spheres of human activity.The greater interdependence of the modern worldhas not made it more secure. The standoff betweenEast and West has been replaced by numerous crisesand conflicts that until recently had remained latent left on the periphery of the interests of the two super-Powers. Some of those conflicts are becoming real orpotential sources of international terrorism  feedingtransborder crime and drug trafficking  which areclosely related to it. Humanity faces the threat of theuncontrolled spread of weapons of mass destructionand the possibility of their falling into the hands ofterrorists. Again the world is witnessing genocide andhumanitarian disasters. All of this presents immediatedanger to each and every one of us.11In that context  the enormous potential of theUnited Nations is in greater demand  primarily inensuring peace and security on a collective and  moreimportantly  on a legitimate legal basis. TheOrganization has at its disposal an entire arsenal ofresources enabling it to coordinate the actions of theinternational community  to combine political effortswith those in the social  economic and humanitarianareas  as well as in the field of protection of humanrights and the environment and other spheres. Weshould develop these assets through the concertedefforts of all States. Russia considers this task to be astrategic core element of its foreign policy.The events of the first years of the newmillennium reaffirm the validity of the conclusionsdrawn by the High-level Panel on Threats  Challengesand Change and the Secretary-General  that is  that astronger United Nations and a better use of itsmultilateral advantages are an essential instrument tobuild a balanced  safe international system  based onrespect for the unique features of every country  theirsovereign equality and collective responsibility. Thereis no reasonable alternative to this.Multilateral mechanisms should also play a keyrole in resolving the issues of disarmament and thenon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction based on strict compliance with the relevantinternational agreements. United Nations achievementsinclude Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) initiated by Russia  and the International Conventionfor the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism which establishes the legal basis for preventingweapons of mass destruction from falling into thehands of terrorists.It is now crucial to prevent an arms race in outerspace. I remind the Assembly that Russia has assumedthe obligation not to be the first to launch any type ofnew weapon into space and has called upon othercountries possessing space capabilities to join in thismeasure to keep outer space peaceful. It is time to takesteps to enhance transparency and build confidence inthis area.The legal basis for countering new threats primarily terrorism  is being reinforced. The adoptionat the recent Security Council summit of resolution1624 (2005)  initiated by the United Kingdom  is anew  important step forward. It places outside the lawnot only the terrorists  their accomplices and those whofinance them  but also the individuals inciting terroristacts. This Security Council decision should put an endto attempts to engage the mass media to propagandizeand justify terrorism.We anticipate that the General Assembly will alsocontribute to the fight against terrorism and willpromote completion of the negotiations on acomprehensive convention on international terrorismas soon as possible. The fight against terrorism must becontinued most decisively. Each of us should criticallyassess his or her efforts in this area.The realities are that while the sanctions againstthe Taliban  Al-Qaida and associated individuals andentities are still in force  the supplying of arms andmaterial and other kinds of assistance to the fighterscontinues. The geographical scope of their activities isexpanding. For many countries  including Russia  thisis tangible on their own soil. Extremists who are notdirectly linked to Al-Qaida  are also stepping up theiractivities in various parts of the world. This requiresstrengthening of cooperation between States and the1267 sanctions Committee  the 1540 Committee and of course  the Security Council’s Counter-TerrorismCommittee. Furthermore  we believe that thecompilation of a consolidated list of all terrorists andterrorist organizations  whether they are associated inany way with Al-Qaida or not  cannot be postponed.The development of criteria for the use of forcein accordance with the United Nations Charter isanother pressing issue. Such criteria  when agreedupon  could be useful if they become a kind ofbenchmark for consideration by the Security Councilof various crisis situations. At the same time  it is clearthat these criteria cannot be applied automatically. TheSecurity Council would authorize the use of force on acase-by-case basis  as called for in the Charter.Another equally important topic is that of States in exercising their Charter right to individual andcollective self-defense  to include self-defense in caseof an external terrorist attack or the imminent threat ofsuch attack. Russia  like other States that have becometargets of terrorist attacks originating beyond theirborders  has no right to err in the eyes of its citizens who have entrusted their security to us. We anticipatethat those critical issues will be given due attention atthis session of the General Assembly.Above all  force should not be used to opposelaw. It can be an effective tool to ensure the rule of law12in crisis situations. It is a tool to be used inextraordinary cases in which vital  legally protectedvalues and interests of the entire internationalcommunity  or certain of its members  are in jeopardy.Unfortunately  in the preparations for the 2005world summit  insufficient attention was given toseeking solutions to those and other important issuesand to finding a way to common understanding. Thus that task must remain a top priority of our agenda.Much remains to be done in terms ofdevelopment and the eradication of poverty  epidemics famine and illiteracy. Such action would be thestrongest way to ensure global stability and eliminatethe breeding grounds of extremism of all kinds. Russiaendorses all initiatives aimed at attaining theMillennium Goals and will enhance its contribution toresolving those urgent issues. The success of ourconcerted efforts to support development greatlydepends on the efficacy of the PeacebuildingCommission to be established. The Commission willachieve the required results if it is more than justanother debating society and if it can be a mechanismfacilitating the greater coordination of the programmesand the projects of all the participants in developmentassistance  including the World Bank Group  theInternational Monetary Fund  regional developmentbanks  other multilateral and bilateral donors and  ofcourse  recipient countries.The dramatic events of the last six months haverevealed the sensitivity of the issue of Security Councilreform for the majority of Member States. Guidedabove all by its interest in ensuring the SecurityCouncil’s effectiveness  Russia continues to supportpossible modifications of that key organ on the basis ofwell-conceived and mutually acceptable decisions.United Nations Members have made the wise decisionto continue negotiations  rather than pushing for a votethat might split the Organization.I recall the striking words: the United Nationswas created not to make heaven on Earth but to savethe Earth from hell. Indeed  the United Nations is notan ideal body  but the best that humanity was able tocreate on the ashes of two world wars. With the help ofthe United Nations  we are able to effectively counterthreats to peace and security in the context of evolvinggeopolitical realities.Today  mankind is facing the challenges ofglobalization. It is not a question of whether we shouldaccept those challenges or not  but of how we shouldrespond to them  and on the basis of what principles.The 2005 world summit decisions outline the generaldirection for our efforts. As a permanent member of theSecurity Council and the next President of the Groupof Eight  Russia  together with other States  willcontinue to strive to strengthen the collectiveunderpinnings of global politics and to enhancemechanisms for multilateral cooperation."
"142",6016,"RWA",60,2005,"Allow me to begin bycongratulating the President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-ninth session  Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon  andall Member States on the successful adoption of the2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). Thesummit outcome document was the product of monthsof consultations and negotiations. We wish to we paytribute to Mr. Ping for skilfully guiding the process toits conclusion. We also wish to congratulate Mr. Jan33Eliasson on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixtieth session. Let me assure him ofmy delegation’s full support and cooperation in thetasks that lie ahead in this session.By adopting the summit outcome document  wereaffirmed our belief in the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations and agreed to take appropriate andurgent steps to achieve the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs). We also committed ourselves torenewing the Organization to make it more efficient effective and transparent so that it can be moreresponsive to the numerous and varied challenges andexpectations of our times and  indeed  can savesucceeding generations from the scourge of war maintain international peace and security  developfriendly relations among nations and  most important promote social progress and better standards of life inlarger freedom.We must work together in a serious and concertedmanner to achieve the MDGs and other goals outlinedin the summit outcome document. We must create aworld that is free from hunger  poverty anddeprivation. We must create a world of greatereconomic opportunity for developing countries. Wemust create a world in which people are free to live indignity  a world that does not tolerate — or fail torespond by protecting populations under threat of —genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing or crimesagainst humanity. This is no time for business as usual.We must be urgent and focused in our action.It is a matter of great concern to us all that ifcurrent trends persist  many African countries will notachieve most of the MDGs by 2015. Some Africancountries have actually regressed since 2000 in theirefforts to achieve MDG targets. Poverty  hunger andinfectious diseases lay waste entire communities andnations  often exacerbate the effects of war andconflict  and make the prospects for recovery infinitelymore problematic. Urgent action needs to be taken toreverse those trends.We need greater commitment from developedcountries  particularly with respect to increasingofficial development assistance to at least 0.7 per centof gross national income  freer and fairer trade anddebt cancellation. Let me remind the Assembly that thetarget of 0.7 per cent of the gross national income forofficial development assistance was set by ourAssembly more than 40 years ago and that  as wespeak  only five countries have reached it. The time forspeeches and debate is over. We must have action onthose issues.Most of us have now come to understand theinterconnectedness and interdependence of all nationsaround the world and the nexus between security anddevelopment. Poverty  hunger and deprivation insub-Saharan Africa are bad for peace and security in all191 nations represented here today. By recognizing thatinterdependence  we accept that there are collectiveresponsibilities and obligations  as well as collectivebenefits and opportunities. The responsibilities include in the words of the Charter  to “promote social progressand better standards of life in larger freedom”. We canhave neither security without development nordevelopment without security at the national  regionaland international levels. It is both unacceptable andunsustainable for one half of the world to live amidwealth and plenty while the other half dies fromdisease and hunger.Our Governments are judged according to theiractions  not according to ideals or principles. Similarly the United Nations should be judged according to itsactions  not according to the values and principles laidout in the Charter. It is our experience that  while theUnited Nations is immaculate in its values andprinciples  it has all too often been found wanting in itsactions. If there is any advice we can offer to theUnited Nations on its sixtieth birthday  the advicewould be that it must learn from its mistakes and bemore effective in implementation.There are probably no States members of thisAssembly apart from Rwanda where the UnitedNations has consistently neglected to learn from itsmistakes  resulting in massive loss of life and untoldmisery. Allow me to explain. It was in 1959  whileRwanda was still under United Nations trusteeship that the first acts of genocide against Tutsis took placethere  leading to the first mass refugee problem on theAfrican continent. The United Nations watchedunmoved and no action was ever taken. In the yearsfollowing 1959  the United Nations stood by in silenceand inaction as pogroms took place throughout thecountry  resulting in massive loss of life andcompounding the refugee crisis.More recently  in 1994  while the United Nationshad a huge political and military presence in Rwanda it watched without taking action the planning and34implementation of genocide. We all recall the shockingdecision of the Security Council to withdrawpeacekeepers at a time when hundreds of thousands ofdefenceless people needed them most.When the genocide was totally consummated  theSecurity Council mandated one of its members to sendtroops to the country  which only succeeded inallowing the perpetrators of the genocide safe passageout of Rwanda and into the Democratic Republic of theCongo  from where they have been a major source ofinsecurity and instability for the entire subregion. Overthe last 11 years  our repeated appeals to disarm anddemobilize those genocidal forces have  if not fallen ofdeaf ears  yielded no results.I raise those examples to highlight the fact thatRwanda is probably the country most interested inUnited Nations reform. We wish to take back homefrom this meeting a message of hope and a promise toour people that we have reinvented a United Nationsthat will never betray them again.My Government welcomes the endorsement ofthe “responsibility to protect” in the summit outcomedocument. The responsibility to protect includes aresponsibility to prevent genocide  crimes againsthumanity and ethnic cleansing  as well as aresponsibility to prevent incitement to commit thosecrimes.But here again  action  not words  will be themeasure of our success or failure. How will the UnitedNations respond the next time action to protectpopulations is required? Will there be lengthyacademic and legal debates on what constitutesgenocide or crimes against humanity  while people die?What is clear to us is that no nation or peopleshould have to face the horrors that we faced 11 yearsago. Where a State is unable or unwilling to protect itspeople  as was the case in Rwanda in 1994  then theresponsibility to provide such protection should — andindeed must — shift immediately to the internationalcommunity. Such action should be taken by theSecurity Council in a timely and decisive manner inorder to save the lives of populations under threat. Ourpledge of “never again” to genocide should not ringhollow the next time we are confronted with suchcrimes.A collective international response to genocideincludes a responsibility for all States to combatimpunity and bring to justice any persons accused ofhaving committed such crimes. We find it inexplicablethat  while some States profess commitment to theCharter  human rights and international law  they allowknown suspects of the Rwanda genocide to live in theircountries and take no action to apprehend them andtransfer them to the International Criminal Tribunal forRwanda or to Rwanda for prosecution. Those Statesmust be challenged  if necessary by the SecurityCouncil  to fulfil their international obligations toapprehend and transfer those fugitives for prosecution.Rwanda  as a country emerging from conflict understands better the usefulness of and stronglysupports the plans to establish a peacebuildingcommission. We have indeed seen the United Nationsspend hundreds of millions of dollars  if not billions on peacekeeping missions that leave behind norepaired road or bridge  no rehabilitated school orhealth centre in the countries where they have beendeployed. Instead  they leave behind children who willnever know their fathers and are most vulnerable topoverty. Those resources could be better spent to createlasting peace and stability.We must  however  ensure that the commissiondoes not become another bureaucracy that is difficultto access and out of touch with the realities incountries emerging from conflict. It should take a long-term approach to post-conflict recovery and change thecurrent practice whereby short-term approaches tolong-standing conflicts mean that we apply mere“band-aid” solutions to highly complex situations.The Commission should consult actively andwidely with the countries affected and those countriesthat have successfully emerged from conflict in therecent past. It must also ensure local ownership ofsolutions and outcomes so that its work can besustainable.We believe that the Security Council should bereformed to improve its transparency andaccountability. The reform process should enableStates that are not members of the Council toparticipate more actively in its deliberative processes especially on issues that affect them. A reformedCouncil should be seen by all States to be moreaccessible  transparent and credible.Terrorism continues to brutally kill innocentcivilians. We must all join hands to fight that evil ofour times. My country will continue to lend its support35to international efforts to combat terrorism. Wewelcome the decision to negotiate and conclude acomprehensive convention against terrorism and mycountry stands ready to partake in that effort. Webelieve  however  that what is lacking is not aconvention but a universally shared commitment tofight the evil. After all  in 1994  we had a Conventionagainst genocide that was 46 years old  and yetgenocide occurred in my country.Turning to issues closer to home  we welcome theprogress made in the peace process in Burundi. Wecongratulate the newly elected Government and standready to work closely with the Government and peopleof Burundi and the international community toconsolidate that commendable progress.We also welcome the progress being made in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  where theTransitional Government has prepared a draftconstitution and has begun the process of registeringvoters for elections. Progress is also being made withrespect to the integration of the armed forces. Wewelcome all those developments  recognizing that theycontribute to sustainable peace and stability in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in the widerregion. We also stand ready to continue to support thetransition process in the Democratic Republic of theCongo.We would also like to take this opportunity torenew our commitment and support for theInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region.My Government looks forward to the forthcomingsecond summit  to be held in Nairobi in December. Thesummit must come up with concrete measures to dealdecisively with the menace of the genocidal militiasthat continue to roam freely in the region and frustrateour collective peace efforts.My Government’s commitment to peace andsecurity in the region is demonstrated through ourparticipation in the peacekeeping Mission in the Sudan where Rwanda is the biggest troop contributor.The role of the international community iscritical. In that connection  we would like to payspecial tribute to the United States Government for itsassistance and support  which have led to theestablishment of a tripartite mechanism comprising theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Rwanda andUganda to examine and resolve issues that could resultin tensions between the three countries.We also welcome the role of the African Unionand the United Nations in advancing the prospects forsustainable peace and security in the region.Finally  let us this time build a United Nationsthat  in addition to having good words to say about life is one which nourishes and protects life all over theworld."
"143",6098,"SDN",60,2005,"I shouldlike to begin my statement with a quotation from theKoran:""Invite all to the way of thy Lord with wisdomand beautiful preaching; and argue with them inways that are best and most gracious: for thyLord knoweth best"" (The Holy Koran XVI:125).Last year  I declared from this rostrum thatpeace - the continuing strategic objective of theGovernment of Sudan - was at hand. Today  from thesame rostrum  I would like to note that peace hasbecome a reality with the signing of theComprehensive Peace Agreement and the adoption ofthe new Constitution. We have started to implement theAgreement in accordance with a fixed timetable.Unfortunately  as soon as we started to implementthe Agreement with our partners in the Sudan PeopleísLiberation Movement (SPLM)  we were faced with agreat tragedy: the death of John Garang  the first VicePresident of the Republic. With his passing  thecountry has lost an invaluable partner and participantin the peace process. It was not just a loss for theSudan  but a great loss for Africa and all peace-lovingpeople. Such tragedies are the true tests of our will and our brethren in the SPLM have responsibly comethrough that crisis and difficult test  putting aside theirbitter shock and continuing to build a durable peace.The Comprehensive Peace Agreement was notlimited solely to issues between the north and thesouth. It set up a comprehensive framework forresolving justly all the problems of our country. It hasestablished rules for a political regime that considerscitizenship to involve rights  duties and obligations -a regime that is based on democracy  the rule of law good governance  respect for human rights and theequitable division of wealth and power based on fairstandards that will ensure comprehensive peace.We are fully committed to the letter and the spiritof the Peace Agreement  and we accept and understandthe magnitude of our responsibility to fulfil it. We arefully confident that bringing peace to the Sudan willhave a positive impact on regional stability and allowthe Sudan to continue to play its proper role within theinternational community.As we have begun to implement the PeaceAgreement  we call upon the international communityimmediately to lift all commercial and economicsanctions and restrictions  to cancel all of the Sudanísexternal debt and to fulfil the pledges it made at theOslo conference. Such actions will provide support forthe Agreement and promote reconstruction anddevelopment in the Sudan. In that context  we expressappreciation and gratitude to the United Nations for theimportant role it has played in the implementation ofthe Agreement  particularly the work of the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  Mr. JanPronk.The people of Darfur are still not able to live inconditions of peace. We will make every effort toimplement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement andthe Declaration of Principles adopted at Abuja  with aview to bringing about that objective. We will continueto cooperate with the international community inimproving the humanitarian and security situation which has already improved greatly. But that is notenough. We hope to ensure complete stability inDarfur. The Governmentís commitment to agreementsand arrangements entered into relating to theachievement of a ceasefire and the improvement of thesecurity situation should be matched by a similarcommitment from the armed movements  which shouldend their violations and agree to an immediateceasefire. The international community shouldcontinue to put pressure on them to negotiate seriouslyin order to achieve a peaceful solution to the problem.My Government underlines the importance ofachieving definitive peace in Darfur as quickly aspossible. We have a three-track plan aimed at returningDarfur to its proper situation. The first is the politicaltrack  which is designed to resolve the root causes ofthe dispute and to reach an agreement. The secondrelates to the implementation of the voluntaryrepatriation programmes. The third relates to thedisarmament  demobilization and reintegrationprogrammes. In the framework of those commitments the Government has encouraged reconciliation amongtribe and community leaders  which would help toprovide a solution to the root causes of the conflict.In order to improve the security situation andachieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict  theGovernment is making every effort  with theparticipation of the international community  to dealwith the urgent humanitarian problem and the problemof internally displaced persons and refugees. We haveundertaken a number of development plans to deal with22the dispute about resources  which represents one ofthe main problems. In that context  the Government islooking forward to entering into an effectiveinternational partnership with a view to bringing aboutthose ambitious plans and establishing a special fundfor development and rehabilitation in Darfur similar tothat agreed to at the Oslo conference for the south.In expressing its appreciation for the efforts ofthe international community  the Sudan would like topay tribute to the active role of the African Union. Wecall on the international community to continue toassist and support that role.The Sudan adopted a transitional Constitution inJuly 2005  and the President and Vice-President willexercise their mandate in conformity with itsprovisions. We have established a Government ofNational Unity  which will continue the transitionalprocess. We have begun this phase by conducting aresponsible dialogue with all members of the politicalopposition  who continue to operate freely. Thetransitional Constitution includes human rightsprovisions ensuring respect for the rights  obligationsand fundamental freedoms of all Sudanese citizens. Wewill continue to work with international organizationsin order to develop and promote human rights in thecountry.This is the last occasion on which I will speak tothe Assembly as Minister for Foreign Affairs of theSudan  because yesterday a new Minister for ForeignAffairs  my brother Mr. Lam Akol  was appointed bythe Popular Movement. I extend to the GeneralAssembly my gratitude and appreciation for itscooperation during my work as Foreign Minister of theSudan in the past several years.Tragically  the Palestinian people are still underIsraeli occupation. The international community iscalled upon to force Israel to halt its illegal practices inthe occupied Palestinian territories  to dismantle theseparation wall  to withdraw from all the Arabterritories that it occupied in 1967 and to allow thePalestinian people to realize their legitimate rights including their right to an independent State  withAl-Quds as its capital. The international communityshould take action to bring about a comprehensive peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict  inaccordance with the resolutions of internationallegitimacy  the road map  the principle of land forpeace and the Madrid terms of reference.The Sudan has participated in agreements aimedat putting an end to nuclear proliferation. The conflict-ridden Middle East should be a zone free from nuclearweapons and other weapons of mass destruction.International justice and laws should apply in thatregion  with no exceptions for any State  with a view toensuring stability and peace  emphasizing the rights ofpeoples to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes particularly in scientific research. The Sudan supportsthe right of all countries  including Iran  to use nuclearpower for peaceful purposes  in accordance withInternational Atomic Energy Agency regulations.The situation in Iraq is very unstable. The Iraqipeople  who are suffering greatly  need theinternational community to help them to overcome thecrisis there. In this respect  we would like tounderscore once again our principled position that wemust preserve the sovereignty  unity and territorialintegrity of Iraq and ensure non-interference in itsinternal affairs  with a view to bringing about stabilityand peace and restoring normal living conditions there.We call upon the international community tocontribute  as soon as possible  to the rebuilding of Iraqand to support the transitional Government so as toallow the Iraqi people to live in dignity on their land.The African Union has set up policies andmechanisms aimed at dealing effectively with thedispute resolution and the establishment of stability onthat continent  which is rich in resources  includinghuman resources. Africa is continuing to use thoseresources for development purposes  within theframework of the New Partnership for AfricaísDevelopment.The first meeting of the International Conferenceon the Great Lakes Region restored hope that peace stability and development can return to the region. Wehope that the second such summit will be held withinthe next few months  and that it will result in a unitedstance that will lead to peace  security anddevelopment in the region. We were encouraged by themeeting that was held on the sidelines of the High-level Plenary Meeting with a view to preparing for asecond International Conference on the Great LakesRegion.In this context  I would like to refer toSomalia - a very important African country  which istrying to move beyond the bitterness of war andconflict and to re-establish itself as a State. Somalia23should receive the cooperation and support that itneeds from the international community  and from theUnited Nations in particular.Since the Millennium Summit in 2000  someachievements have been made with a view to meetingthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). But theGoals have not been adequately achieved in Africa which still has to deal with poverty  disease underdevelopment and debt. As we meet here fiveyears after the first summit  we must pause andconsider what we have achieved and what we aspire toachieve. We live in a world in which people havevaried standards of living and wealth. The rich havebecome richer  and the poor have become poorer. Thegap between them is great  and there are enormousparadoxes. There are very rich countries whose citizensspend millions of dollars on weight loss  and there areother poor countries that seek just a small fraction ofthat amount to keep barely alive.We take this opportunity to reaffirm  as agreed inthe framework of the Millennium Declaration  that wemust achieve the Millennium Development Goals inorder to create a better life for all humanity. Here  wemust point out that the Sudan has worked hard to attainthe goals and has made significant progress in reducingpoverty and increasing basic education levels  despitethe unjust siege and the long conflict in the southernpart of the country. All those efforts are reflected inSudanís 2004 MDG report.In that context  we should stress the importanceof the total cancellation of debt. Debt is a greathindrance to achieving the Development Goals inAfrica and in the least developed countries. Attachingconditions to debt cancellation will only impededevelopment. Here  we must remind developedcountries of their commitments to financing fordevelopment  in accordance with the MonterreyConsensus.An international partnership to achieve the MDGsas envisaged in Goal 8  is essential. Unfortunately  themain difficulty in achieving the Goals is theestablishment of such a partnership  which will not bepossible without allowing developing  and leastdeveloped countries in particular  to integrate fully intothe international economy. Imposing unilateraleconomic sanctions against developing countrieshinders free trade and investment. Financing and thetransfer of technology are among the other issuesencountered in efforts to achieve sustainabledevelopment.We live in a world of many challenges andthreats. The international community has recognizedthat development  peace and security are closelyinterconnected. The main challenges faced by theinternational community today are maintaininginternational peace and security and achievingeconomic growth and development. Meeting thosechallenges will be possible only in a collective worldled by an effective and capable United Nations.The Sudan has actively participated in theconsultations on creating a framework for collectiveaction and on United Nations reform. We supportreform that is in accordance with the purposes andprinciples of the Charter and the relevant provisions ofinternational law. We have emphasized theestablishment of a new human rights mechanism toaddress the shortcomings - including politicization selectivity and double standards - that have preventedthe Commission on Human Rights from carrying outits responsibilities. The Sudan believes that we shouldconsider establishing a new mechanism that deals withthe negative policies of the past and is committed tothe principles of equality among States and respect forequitable geographical representation  in accordancewith the relevant provisions of the Charter. On thebasis of what the United Nations has successfullyachieved in the security  economic and social areas  weshould aspire to achieve the objectives of the High-level Plenary Meeting and thus to create a peaceful andsafe world in which all of us will shoulder ourresponsibilities.Clearly  we all reject terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations and we stand together with others toeliminate it; indeed  a counter-terrorism conference isnow being held in Khartoum to combat terrorism inEast Africa. What we reject are attempts to confuseterrorism with the struggle of peoples for liberation andindependence and attempts to link terrorism to aspecific religion or culture. Terrorism is aninternational scourge that is not limited to a specificreligion or culture  and we believe that any attempt toconfuse the issue could cause problems and weakenour collective resolve to develop a comprehensivestrategy to combat it.The Sudan will continue to be a messenger toStates  calling for a dialogue among cultures and24civilizations aimed at attaining humanityís objectives.The international fight against terrorism must be basedon the Charter of the United Nations and the relevantprovisions of international law. In that context  theSudan calls for the holding of an internationalconference to arrive at an agreed definition of terrorismand stresses that the rejection of terrorism does notmean that we should ignore the reasons behind it. Wemust deal with the root causes of the problem if we areto be successful in eradicating it.In conclusion  the Sudan reaffirms its belief inthe purposes and principles of the Charter. We stressour resolve to continue to work with the internationalcommunity to strengthen the Organization so that it canefficiently carry out its role and mandate."
"144",6143,"SEN",60,2005,"It is apleasure for me to express on behalf of my delegationwarm congratulations on the outstanding election  ofthe President to lead the sixtieth regular session of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. I see theselection as a tribute to his excellent qualities as adiplomat without equal and recognition of the tirelesscommitment of Sweden to the noble causes of ourOrganization. He may be sure that in the discharge ofhis lofty mission  Senegal’s support is completelyunderstood.Allow me to take this opportunity to say howmuch we have appreciated the commitment and theflair that his predecessor  my friend and brother  HisExcellency the Minister of State Jean Ping  dischargedhis mandate at a decisive point in the existence of theUnited Nations. Whatever the results of thenegotiations under way for a just and in-depth reformof our Organization  our brother Jean Ping will havegiven the most of himself  and we all owe himgratitude and respect.I should also like here to pay tribute to theunfailing dedication to the causes of our Organizationdisplayed by His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  theSecretary-General of the United Nations  a dedicationthat was recently reflected in his excellent and timelyinitiative to submit to Member States a substantialnumber of proposals aimed at ensuring the rebirth ofthe United Nations and making it possible to envisagea new dawn for multilateralism.This year’s general debate has been symbolic andstrategic in nature in that it is being held following theHigh-level Plenary Meeting  which mobilized all of ourleaders and was an expression of the will of all of theMember States to make the necessary adjustments for arevitalization of the founding values of the UnitedNations and for a better consideration of the aspirationof all peoples.This is a crucial meeting carrying as it doeswithin it the great hopes of the disadvantagedpopulations of the world  victims of endemicunderdevelopment. The major results of this summit  inmy view  are an expression of the faith of theinternational community in spirit and solidarity interdependence and international cooperation  theraison d’être of the United Nations  at a time when oursocieties are faced with an increasingly complexinternational environment characterized by aglobalization that is still not being clearly defined.Although there are signposts  the road before usis still long  and so great is the lag behind of manydeveloping countries  particularly on the Africancontinent  in achieving the Millennium Development13Goals  that billions of men and women around theworld should be helped to free themselves fromdifficulties and from exclusion and despair so they canfully enjoy the dividends of peace and security.This is why my delegation strongly hopes thatthis act of faith will be translated into tangible actionsand into results that are palpable for all. This isprecisely what the Secretary-General invited us toconsider in highlighting in his report of last March theindivisibility of the three pillars of development security and human rights.Therefore  we must all act. For us  a developingcountry  acting means implementing strategies that willbe beneficial for development  supported by clear-sighted policies of good governance and the rule of lawincluding all sectors of society. And for the developedcountries this means scrupulously honouring thecommitments undertaken in terms of resolving thequestion of debt  promoting a just and equitable tradeand improving the volume and quality of aidmechanisms.By the historic decisions that it is calling for  theagenda established by the summit confirms eloquentlythe firmness of the commitments of heads of State andGovernment to focus on fighting for development whose ultimate goal is the harmonious integration ofdeveloping countries in the globalization process.However  the heavy interdependence of the worldeconomy and the demands for peace naturally call for areal global partnership  which includes a sharing ofresponsibilities and takes into account the specificneeds of developing countries.Nevertheless  the desired increase in assistance todeveloping countries is not a sufficient condition forthem to have lasting inclusion in the globalizationprocess. We also need to rationalize this assistance andto improve the delivery mechanisms. Indeed  despitethe recent measures of debt cancellation for certainAfrican countries and the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt Initiative  the debt burden continues tohamper any improvement in the economies ofdeveloping countries  which now find themselves inperpetual dependence on donors.Clearly  Africa is falling further and furtherbehind the objectives of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals and will continue to do so if its debt burden isnot drastically alleviated. Since the mechanismsplanned for bringing the continent out of debt have notyet borne fruit  we should  apart from the partialmeasures which we should welcome  envisage bolderand more durable solutions.Based on this concern  the African ministers offinance met to discuss the strategy for debt reduction inAfrica in May of this year in Dakar  under the aegis ofthe African Union. This was in preparation for aconference during which the President of the Republicof Senegal  His Excellency Abdoulaye Wade  proposedto the African Union that it conduct an “x-ray” ofAfrican debt.The economic recovery of the developingcountries is all the more delayed in that they continue helplessly  to be buffeted by an unfair and unbalancedworld trade environment due to protectionist policiesand export subsidies which distort the whole idea ofcompetitiveness and divert trade from the objective ofdevelopment. This contributes to making producers inthe poor countries more vulnerable and explains thehigh hopes that we place in the next World TradeOrganization Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong inorder to conclude the Doha cycle for development anddesign a multilateral trade system that is non-discriminatory and equitable for all. We welcome theparticular attention being given increasingly to dealingwith the specific needs of Africa in the internationaldevelopment agenda.Unfortunately  we cannot fail to deplore the factthat  paradoxically  the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment (NEPAD)  adopted by this Assembly continues to suffer from a deficit in implementationdue partly to internal inertia and to slow multilateralsupport  particularly in terms of financialdisbursements.I would like here once again to make a seriousappeal to States and to the agencies of the UnitedNations system  including the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  to make concrete their commitments tohelp Africa implement NEPAD — this ambitiousprogramme of development.One of the priority sectors of this programmeremains that of information and communicationtechnology. In this respect I should like to welcome thecreation — following the first phase of the WorldSummit on the Information Society — of a digitalsolidarity fund. This Fund  a proposal of PresidentWade  rapidly became an initiative of the AfricanUnion and was adopted in March 2005 by the14international community in Geneva. It is aimed athelping the countries of the South to bridge theirdigital divide with the North and to promotesustainable development. I should like here to repeatSenegal’s invitation to States  local groups  heads ofcompanies and civil society to contribute in cash and inkind to this fund.The many initiatives to be taken in the next fewweeks and months should not let us lose sight of thebattle that we must wage at the worldwide  regionaland national levels to defeat pandemics of infectiousdiseases such as HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria andpolio  which are decimating our populations. Asregards HIV/AIDS  the Government of Senegal  whichdevotes more than one-tenth of its budget to health will continue through bold actions based oninformation  education  awareness campaigns prevention and subsidies to fight pandemics tirelessly.However  the encouraging results achieved byseveral countries  including Senegal  which hasmanaged to keep the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS atone of the lowest levels in the continent  cannot beconsolidated without substantial and consistent supportfrom international partners. Allow me to remind theGeneral Assembly of the good news announced just afew weeks ago of the prevalence rate in my countryfalling from 1.7 per cent to 0.7 per cent.I would also like to invite the internationalcommunity to support Africa in its fight againstdrepanocytosis — otherwise known as sickle cellanaemia — which has become a public health problemin several countries. This disease  apart from thesuffering that it inflicts on the populations  is anobstacle to development in that it makes sufferersunable to work. For that reason the Summit of Headsof State and Government of the African Union  held inSirte from 2 to 5 July  adopted a decision supportingthe inclusion of genetic drepanocytosis on the list ofpriorities for public health. I would thus invite theAssembly to join this battle against drepanocytosis.Equally vital is the willingness of our externalpartners to commit themselves with Africa to finding asolution to the situation of its agriculture  whichcontinues to suffer from an environment that isincreasingly hostile to the flourishing of designcapacities and to transfers of technology central totheir development. This is the thrust of the initiative ofthe Dakar Agricultural Forum  launched by PresidentWade  the first meeting of which was held in February2005 in Dakar on the topic “The world agriculturaldivide: opening up prospects for agricultural areas indevelopment”.This Forum was an opportunity for a productiveexchange of views and ideas among officials in thesector  representatives of professional organizations non-governmental organizations  multinationalcompanies  scientists and academics from allcontinents. The Forum considered the possibilities ofpartnerships in order to reduce the agricultural dividebetween North and South by using science and thetransfer of technology  and discussed successfulagricultural experiments submitted and presented atDakar by experts from several countries. By initiatingthis project in Dakar  the Government of Senegalsought to stimulate thought on an original concept ofdevelopment  taking into account the political technical and sociological constraints peculiar to thecountries of the South.Another challenge that has a negative impact onagriculture is desertification  which affects nearly onethird of the African continent. There was a meeting ofexperts from more than 30 countries in Dakar from26 to 29 July to discuss this problem. That meeting washeld on the initiative of President Wade  in accordancewith a mandate from his African peers  to considerdeveloping the Sahara and its boundaries in the Sahel.As President Wade said  it is a question of “having agood  hard look at the Sahara” and thinking about thecreation of a High Authority of the Sahara based on theAmerican model of the Tennessee Valley Authority which was a successful example of integrateddevelopment.We should like here to invite the internationalcommunity  which decided to proclaim 2006 as theInternational Year of Deserts and Desertification  toparticipate in this important work of constructing whathas been called by President Wade and his brother andfriend  President Olusegun Obasanjo  the “Great GreenWall of Africa”  to slow the advance of the desert. AsPresident Wade has said  “Either the desert or thehuman being — one will have to disappear.” We hopethat it will be the desert.Certainly  the struggle to promote developmentshould go hand in hand with another fight  that for aworld where peace  security and the scrupulous respectof human rights and individual freedoms reigns. This is15why my country fully supports the importantconclusions of the outcome document of the High-levelPlenary Meeting  relating in particular to therevitalization of the work of the General Assembly  therestructuring of the Security Council  the creation of aPeacebuilding Commission and of a Human RightsCouncil  and also the adoption of the fundamentalprinciple of the responsibility to protect.From this rostrum  the President of Senegal  onthe question of the expansion of the Security Council recently made a strong appeal that  first  the historicinjustice done to Africa — the only region of the worldmissing from the group of permanent members of theSecurity Council — be redressed. Certainly  ourcontinent would like at the end of the process toreceive two permanent seats in the Council  two thirdsof whose agenda  unfortunately  is devoted to Africa.However  the proposal of Senegal — a country thatdefends the spirit of compromise with other interestgroups — to put Africa at the beginning and at the endof the expansion of the Security Council  deserves theattention of the entire international community.There is no doubt that the full implementation ofthe conclusions of the High-level Plenary Meeting willmake it possible for our Organization to connect betterto the realities of this new century. However  the fineprospects that have been opened up by the Meetingshould not make us forget the serious impact of thepainful situations to which our world has been ahelpless observer for many years. I would just mentionthree such situations: the disturbing deadlock innegotiations in the area of disarmament  in particularnuclear disarmament; terrorism; and the bogging downand lack of headway in the peace process in the MiddleEast.It is not yet too late for the “argument ofpower” — and nuclear power  which I have just set outhere — to yield to the “power of argument” of sharedpeace  so that weapons of mass destruction — nuclear chemical or biological — can be definitively banned.As regards terrorism  the recent attacks onLondon and on Sharm el-Sheikh are painful remindersof the persistence of an evil that can only be eliminatedthrough determined and decisive mobilization by theinternational community. This response is all the moretimely since the terrorist hydra attacks the sanctity oflife  defies all reason and undermines the foundationsof the rights and freedoms of the individual. It is theview of Senegal that  quite frankly  there is no causesufficiently just or sufficiently good to justify the useof terrorism and the massacre of women  children andinnocent civilians.Last but not least  the Middle East continues tosend us daily images of a seemingly endless tragedyfor the Palestinian people. We note the reluctance ofthe occupying Power  Israel  to respect the spirit andthe letter of the road map  which has been seen in therecent settlements established in “Greater Jerusalem” accompanied by destruction of houses belonging toPalestinians and the refusal to give them authorizationto reunite their families. And we see it once again inthe Israeli plan to link East Jerusalem with thesettlement of Ma’aleh Adumim in the West Bank.The international community must redouble itsefforts and vigilance to put an end to the harsh actionsagainst the Palestinians including the construction ofthe separation wall and the settlements  and takemeasures to enable both parties to work to concluderapidly a mutually advantageous peace.In advocating justice  it seems inconceivable thatthe Republic of China on Taiwan  with its 23 millioninhabitants and its impressive economic dynamism should be kept out of the United Nations.Thus  we express the hope that  finally  peace willreign in all regions of the world  particularly in Africa.This is why we welcome the fact that countries such asGuinea-Bissau  Sierra Leone  Liberia or Burundi despite conflict  are emerging from crisis andembarking on the path to reconciliation andreconstruction.I would like to add just one last word on Guinea-Bissau. For us  Guinea-Bissau has met its commitmentsas regards the international community  proving itsmaturity and its attachment and dedication to peace. Itis thus for the international community to accompanythis process now under way in Bissau. To that end  themeeting of donors planned for November should beheld without conditions and should lead to substantialmaterial and financial support so as to help the peopleof Guinea-Bissau continue to take charge of theirdestiny.I should like to conclude on this point and paywarm tribute to Mr. Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu  SecretaryGeneral of the Organization of the Islamic Conference for his restructuring efforts to make the OIC a modern16and effective organization more capable of strengtheningcooperation within the Islamic Oumah and contributingto the fight against underdevelopment.In this noble fight  my country  Senegal  remainsmore determined than ever to work with all of itspartners in order to bring about a fairer  more peacefuland more prosperous world."
"145",6190,"SGP",60,2005,"A few weeks ago  a youngMuslim lawyer in Singapore told me about a recentexperience he had had in an East Asian airport. Unlikeothers holding Singaporean passports who wereclearing immigration  he was told to stand aside. Whenhe asked the reason  the immigration officer mutteredthat there were ""too many Mohamads"" that day.Smiling to himself  the Singaporean waited patientlyand peered around  wondering how long he had to wait.The officer then warned him to stand still. He suddenlyfelt a chill along his spine.Muslims all over the world are being profiled bysecurity agencies. Since 11 September 2001  Muslimstravelling to Western countries have been subject to allmanner of interrogations and searches. Although theprofiling is now done more subtly now  it continues.And in East Asia  profiling is increasing.When sudden threats appear  perhaps it is naturalto expect a certain overreaction from the affectedcommunities. After Pearl Harbour  all Japanese peopleliving in America became suspect  including those bornthere. Many were interned. By today's standards  thatwas an affront. But at that time  it was widely felt to bea necessary precaution. Shocked by that reaction Japanese-American leaders set out to prove theirAmericanness  for example by forming the Japanese-American 100th Infantry Battalion  which foughtheroically in the European theatre.The travails of the Japanese-Americans were notunique. Tribalism is a basic human instinct. We mayproclaim that all men are brothers  but we reflexivelydistinguish degrees of closeness. Divisions of race language  culture and religion run deep in humansociety and emerge under stress. The ascendancy of theWest in the past few centuries created tremendousstress in non-Western communities  upsetting allrelationships and giving rise to a variety of responses all of which sought to reconcile each communityíssense of self with the needs of a Western-definedmodernity. In Asia  for example  the re-emergence ofChina and India on the global stage has been aprolonged struggle of reconciling transformation withtradition.That is the broader historical context againstwhich the relationship between Muslims and non-Muslims in the world must be viewed today. It is asubject that concerns us all deeply in the UnitedNations.There are two evolving developments which feedon each other. The first is change within Islam itself;the other is the relationship between Muslims and non-Muslims in different parts of the world. Both requireour close attention.The response of the Islamic world to thechallenge of modernization will affect the developmentof the entire world in this century. In some ways  it iscomparable to that of the Chinese response tomodernization  and it will probably take much longer.The decline of the Ottoman Empire in the nineteenthcentury took place at about the same time as thedecline of the Qing Dynasty in China. Both collapsedat the beginning of the twentieth century. After many8twists and turns  China has finally re-emerged onto theglobal stage with a bright future ahead of it.There are about as many Muslims in the world asthere are Chinese. In contrast to China  however  theIslamic world is unlikely to re-coalesce in theforeseeable future. Once Ataturk refused the caliphateand with iron determination started reforming Turkishinstitutions on the Western model  the Islamic worldlost its centre. From then on  different Islamic societiesexperimented with different approaches and moved indifferent directions. It has been a mixed story.The different responses of Muslim societies to thechallenge of modernization are accompanied by a greatideological debate among political and religiousleaders. Good governance has become a major issue with calls for greater transparency and moredemocracy. In this debate  it is natural that somegroups should look back to a romanticized period whenthe Islamic world was united and pristine and seek itsre-establishment in the twenty-first century. Such werethe ideas of the Muslim Brotherhood  which emanatedfrom Egypt at the beginning of the twentieth century.The ideology of that movement continues to inspireIslamic groups in various parts of the world today. Ifonly Muslims were to abide strictly by the teachings ofIslam  there would be no corruption  Governmentswould be just and effective and Islamic societies wouldbecome strong again.In many Islamic countries at various times  thesegroups have been suppressed for being subversive  andthose who funded them were thought to have ulteriormotives. This struggle for the soul of Islam is anongoing process. However  it is not a struggle uniqueto Islam. For more than 200 years  Europe wasbloodied by religious wars  which ended only with theTreaty of Westphalia in 1648  which created the systemof modern European States. But even then  there wasstill religious persecution  which led many Europeansto flee to the New World. In the twentieth century  thesoul of Europe was torn by communism  fascism andanti-Semitism. It was precisely to overcome thosedivisions that the European Union was established bystages  creating the longest period of peace on thatcontinent.How Islamic society evolves in the comingdecades is mainly for Muslims to decide. Generallyspeaking  non-Muslims would have no standing toparticipate in this debate but for two factors whichhave become critical and which have strategicimportance for us all.The first factor is the emergence of the ideologyof Al-Qaida and its sister organizations  such as Al-Jamaía al-Islamiyah. This ideology is a malignantmutation of the ideas associated with the MuslimBrotherhood and other groups that argued for a returnof Islamic society to an idealized past. It takes thoseideas to an extreme and preaches hatred against non-Muslims worldwide  justifying violence againstinnocent bystanders even if they are Muslim. Thesuicide bomber has become a potent weapon in itsarmoury. The followers of this ideology will nothesitate to use weapons of mass destruction if they canget their hands on them. We have a duty in the UnitedNations to join in the global war against them.The second factor necessitating the involvementof non-Muslims in the Islamic debate is the growingMuslim diaspora in many non-Islamic countries. Asminority communities  Muslims living in countries likeFrance and Germany  for example  have to acceptcertain limitations in the practice of their religion. Withgrowing religiosity in recent years  issues like thewearing of the headscarf have surfaced. Whatconstitutes a reasonable compromise varies fromcountry to country. For example  Singapore allowsaspects of sharia law to apply to Muslims  includingMuslim men being allowed four wives  although onlyunder stringent conditions. It would be hard for non-Muslims to accept this in Europe.The fact is that while some human values areuniversal - and we should find more of them - manyare not. We have to accept this diversity in the world.A greater tolerance of diversity in the world wouldcreate better conditions for peaceful cooperationbetween Muslims and non-Muslims and wouldinfluence the debate within Islam itself.If non-Muslims tar all Muslims with the brush ofterrorism and non-Muslim majority communities treatminority Muslim communities as problemcommunities  the future will be troubled for all of us.In such a climate  Muslim extremists will gainascendancy  and the terrorists will find fertile groundfor recruitment everywhere.It is ridiculous to argue that terrorism is inherentin Islam. To do so is to play into the hands of theterrorists. That such views are increasingly beingexpressed in reputable journals and newspapers is9troubling. Of course one could find blood-curdlingpassages in the Koran and the Hadith  but thesepassages must be read in context. We find similarpassages too in the Old Testament. As we would not therefore  argue that terrorism is inherent in Judaismand Christianity  so we should not make Islam theproblem. That would be a big mistake. There wereperiods in history when Islamic society wasconsiderably more advanced than Western society.Equally  it would be a big mistake for Muslimleaders to allow Muslim extremists to make claims onbehalf of Muslims worldwide without contest. Thiscauses non-Muslims to suspect that Muslims aregenerally in sympathy with them. To be sure  there aregenuine grievances that have to be addressed  likePalestine  Chechnya and the future of Iraq  but theseare issues that are more political than religious. Thestrategy of the extremists is to polarize Muslims andnon-Muslims worldwide  thereby widening their baseof support. Muslim leaders have to counter thisstrategy. It is also essential for them to reach out tonon-Muslim audiences as well. The recent bombings inLondon led to a strong anti-Muslim backlash at thegrass roots that threatened the fabric of British society.This in turn put pressure on Muslim leaders in theUnited Kingdom to condemn the terrorists in clearterms.In the end  the fight against the terrorists has tobe won within Muslim communities themselves. It is abattle for hearts and minds that requires Muslims towork together with non-Muslims against a commonenemy.We have to make a concerted effort to understandeach other better. With globalization  all societies havebecome multiracial and multireligious to a greater orlesser extent. The pluralism we hold as an ideal in theUnited Nations is not a choice; it is a vital necessity.In 1998  at its fifty-third session  the GeneralAssembly declared in resolution 53/22 that 2001 wouldbe the United Nations Year of Dialogue amongCivilizations. In 2001  at the fifty-sixth session  theGeneral Assembly adopted the Global Agenda forDialogue among Civilizations (resolution 56/6). Andthis year the United Nations sponsored numerousmeetings on interfaith dialogue. A few months ago  thefirst Asia-Middle East Dialogue was held in Singaporeto promote greater understanding between twoimportant regions of the world.We need to translate our declarations of principleinto everyday language and into practice. Are therelimits to what politicians can say to win votes? Shouldreligious leaders be allowed to preach hatred  even inclose confines? What do we teach our children inschool? What does all this mean to the immigrationofficer at the airport who does not know thatMohammed is the most common name in the world?Singapore  a cosmopolitan city-State with amultiracial and multireligious population  isparticularly vulnerable. We have experienced uglyracial and religious riots before and have learned thatracial and religious harmony should never be taken forgranted. It has been necessary for the Government toinvolve itself in many aspects of ordinary life including discouraging Christian missionaries fromtargeting Muslims for conversion  stopping mosquesfrom sharply turning up the volume of theirloudspeakers when calling the faithful to prayer limiting the size of joss sticks which Buddhists andTaoists burn for their rituals and arresting those whoincite racial and religious hatred. What may appear tobe a small thing to one community can be a seriousprovocation to another.This has become the world we live in. We cannotignore the diversity around us in our everyday life orthe tribalism which is in our nature. We will continueto disagree on many things such as the nature ofdemocracy  gender relationships  the death penalty stem-cell research and what we can or cannot eat. Themoment we dismiss those differences as unimportant or lightly condemn those who disagree with us  thetrouble begins.Therefore  as we strive to achieve the MillenniumGoals in the United Nations - and they are worthyGoals - a key task for us is to accept  even celebrate the differences that divide us in our daily lives. Toparaphrase Pope John-Paul II  it is only because we aremany that we are one  and the United Nationsexpresses that ideal."
"146",6223,"SLB",60,2005,"I bring warmgreetings  Sir  from the Government and people ofSolomon Islands  and I wish to congratulate thePresident on his election to lead the General Assemblyat its sixtieth session. I would like to assure him ofSolomon Islands’ support and cooperation during histerm in office as he guides the work of the Assemblyover the next 12 months.My delegation would also like to commend andregister its deep appreciation to his predecessor  ourcolleague  the Honourable Jean Ping  Foreign Ministerof Gabon  for his invaluable contribution and ableleadership of the proceedings of fifty-ninth session ofthe General Assembly.28Solomon Islands also extends its gratitude toSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his vision dedication and leadership in making the UnitedNations relevant and responsive to today’s threats.This Organization rose out of the ashes of theSecond World War with the sole purpose of ensuringthat never again would the world allow crimes againsthumanity to flourish. Sixty years on  genocide terrorism  HIV/AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis and hungercontinue to claim millions of lives annually. Accordingto a recent World Health Organization report preventable disease  such as malaria  claims more livesthan today’s conflicts put together. Of 300 to 500million clinical cases annually  1.5 to 2.7 million livesare lost. In this connection  Solomon Islands suffershigher rates of malaria and maternal mortality than anyother country in the Pacific region. My delegation ispleased to see the summit agree on the establishmentand implementation of “quick win” initiatives  such asfree distribution of treated bed nets and antimalarialmedicines. But more needs to be done; acomprehensive malaria eradication programme onpublic and environmental health must be initiated andimplemented simultaneously.Despite these overwhelming facts  the worldcontinues to spend even more on military programmesand equipment. The lack of progress on disarmamentand non-proliferation  with the continuing threat ofterrorism  begs the question as to whether the worldhas indeed become safer  more stable and protected  asthe founders of the United Nations Charter envisioned.It further raises the question whether internationalframeworks and cooperation agreements have  in fact contained today’s threats.Solomon Islands condemns terrorism in all itsforms. In this regard  we are embarking on a legislativeprocess  with New Zealand’s support  to increase ournational capacity in enhancing regional securityarrangements through the Nasonini Declaration onRegional Security and the Honiara Declaration on LawEnforcement Cooperation  particularly as concernsthreats posed by international terrorism andtransnational crimes.In keeping with this year’s theme  “For a strongerand more effective United Nations: the follow-up andimplementation of the High-level Plenary Meeting inSeptember 2005”  we are faced with the challenge ofcontinuing the reform process. As my Prime Ministerpointed out last week during the high-level summit  wemust not solve today’s problems with yesterday’ssolutions  but rather with a new vision that will build astronger multilateral system to confront threats andchallenges in the twenty-first century. Solomon Islandsnotes and supports the Summit Outcome (resolution60/1) as a starting point for change.Current reforms to rejuvenate the multilateralsystem must occur at three levels — international regional and national. The forthcoming Doha process beginning in December of this year  will provideanother opportunity for the international community toequitably spread the fruits of globalization  take to taskthe imbalance that exists within the economicinternational system and address the challenges ofvulnerable and fragile States. The Doha developmentagenda must accord stable and predictable marketaccess to all least developed countries’ products technology transfer and human resources development.For Solomon Islands to share the fruits of themultilateral trading system in a meaningful way  itmust first address the domestic bottlenecks that impedeits full participation  such as supply-side restraints andother “behind-the-door” complementary policies thatare not conducive to a business-friendly environment.The Brussels Declaration and the Programme forAction for the Least Developed Countries will bereviewed beginning next year. The lack ofimplementation of the Brussels Programme speaks ofthe international community’s commitment to 700million of the world’s most vulnerable persons.Solomon Islands is off track in terms of meeting itsMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) obligation;however  as a least developed country in the Asia/Pacific region  it is committed to meeting its MDGsand seeks international support and attention in thisendeavour. Poverty has no boundaries  and weacknowledge and support the Jakarta Declaration. Forthe MDGs and other benefits to be realized andsustained  Solomon Islands will need to grow itseconomy. Solomon Islands also calls for a greater in-country presence on the part of the United Nations towork in partnership with us to meet the Goals.Solomon Islands supports the proposal toestablish the Peacebuilding Commission. TheCommission will play a difficult and important role inassisting countries that are emerging from conflictsituations to reintegrate  reconstruct and rebuild Stateinstitutions in order to maintain peace  security and29economic stability. In that light  the RegionalAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) isa shining example from which the Commission coulddraw lessons. It has demonstrated that  with courageand determination  the principles and institutions ofdemocracy and human rights can be safeguarded andprotected. A two-pronged approach of law and ordercomplemented by economic security and carried out inthe spirit of true partnership will create an opportunityfor peace to prosper. Solomon Islands also welcomesthe Assembly’s endorsement of the concept of theresponsibility to protect populations from genocide  warcrimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity  ascontained in the summit’s outcome document.Solomon Islands would like to express its deepappreciation to Australia  New Zealand and our goodfriends and neighbours  the Pacific Island countries fortheir continued support and contribution to RegionalAssistance Mission. We could not have done it withoutthem  and I thank them.Solomon Islands needs to progress beyond theinitial crisis of law and order  but the challengeremains to nurture the country and build an economy tosustain it. Per capita income in Solomon Islands hascurrently dropped to more than 20 per cent below the1995 level. To repair that situation  Solomon Islandsmust address harmful past policies of economicmismanagement  a lack of fiscal discipline  faultygovernance and capacity constraints at all levels.Solomon Islands is well endowed with naturalresources and a young population that can form thebasis of a good labour supply  but it lacks both humancapital and physical capital  with poor infrastructure tolift productivity and deliver sustainable growth that isbroad-based  rurally focused and people-centred.That is why the Government is initiating astrategy to attract and build capital. The strategy hingeson establishing a stable macroeconomic environment creating simple business-friendly tax and regulatoryregimes and improving infrastructure and goodgovernance. With respect to establishing a crediblefiscal policy  we have returned the budget to surpluses.Revenues have been enhanced. Expenditures have beentightened and prioritized. Monetary policies are beingfine-tuned and aligned. State-owned enterprisescontinue to be reformed  with steps taken to removebarriers and improve efficient shipping networks which are critical for island nations. Those initiativeswill be coupled with a new draft investment law  acredible budget for 2006 and the introduction of a fairand simple tax reform bill  which will be submitted tothe Parliament at its next sitting.Debt levels remain crippling  amounting to morethan 100 per cent of the gross domestic product of theSolomon Islands. Talks with creditors have begun toestablish a workable debt strategy. The innovativeapproach advocated by the Philippines of a debt-for-equity swap to finance MDG projects is worth lookinginto.Capacity-building in governance that is free fromcorruption is vital for rural development  health andeducation. Leadership and governance  which arecritical for stability and economic development  arebeing improved by clarifying rules and expectationsand by adopting an outcome-oriented approach. Thatwill improve the transparency of public processes andthe effectiveness of institutions.Solomon Islands acknowledges the contributionsof Australia  New Zealand  Papua New Guinea  Japan the European Union  Taiwan  the Asian DevelopmentBank and the World Bank  among other donor partners in support of Government initiatives to rebuild ourfragile and shattered State. Solomon Islands mustconsolidate the gains achieved in the past two years onthe security and economic fronts and move forwardconstructively. Much is yet to be done.On climate change  the world continues toexperience changing weather patterns and has seen anincrease in the frequency and intensity of naturaldisasters. Small island developing States (SIDS)  suchas Solomon Islands  are more vulnerable andsusceptible to natural disasters  and we call for theinternational community to renew its focus on  andconcrete commitment to  the issue of climate change in line with the summit’s outcome document. Mydelegation welcomes the entry into force of the KyotoProtocol in February this year and calls on thosecountries that have not yet ratified the Protocol to doso at their earliest convenience.In the light of the Asian tsunami of lastDecember  it would be cost-effective for the world toinvest in mitigation measures  in particular renewableenergy resources. The Hyogo strategy of the KobeConference and the Mauritius Strategy of January thisyear provide an excellent starting point. Sadly however  the Group of Eight meeting on climate30change did not take decisive action. For that reason Solomon Islands  as a member of the Alliance of SmallIsland States  urges the Group of Eight to reconsiderthe issue  because the environment has an impact onthe physical survival of small island developing States.Closer to home  Solomon Islands wishes toacknowledge the completion of the United NationsObserver Mission in Bougainville  Papua New Guinea with the successful election in Papua New Guinea’snewly autonomous province of Bougainville. We wishour closest Melanesian neighbour every success inbuilding on the political gains made so far  and weassure Bougainville of our commitment to all bilateralcooperative arrangements. Solomon Islands alsoacknowledges Papua New Guinea’s ongoing bilateralassistance to Solomon Islands.With respect to Security Council reform Solomon Islands believes that the membership of theCouncil should reflect the political and economicrealities of our time. In that regard  Solomon Islandssupports the expansion of the Security Council andfeels that a country such as Japan  which has strongbilateral links with Solomon Islands  should beaccorded a permanent seat on the Council. Japan’sinclusion will contribute to bridging the divide betweenthe multilateral institutions and Member States.This year marks the tenth anniversary of theBeijing Platform for Action. The results have beenmixed. Solomon Islands believes that improving thewelfare of women is an indispensable requirement forsustainable security. At the regional level  issuesrelating to the empowerment of women are beingincorporated into the Pacific Plan  which will bediscussed by Pacific Islands Forum leaders in Octoberthis year.The United Nations was founded on the principleof maintaining international peace and security. Overthe years  some threats continue to receive moreattention than others. The Anti-Secession Law enactedby the People’s Republic of China in March this yearhas threatened peace and security on the Taiwan Strait.The situation creates a security vacuum that  if leftunattended  will continue to fester and will put inquestion the credibility of this premier multilateralinstitution. There is no mechanism to address such threatswithin the parameters of the United Nations Charter.Solomon Islands therefore renews its call to havethe issue debated in the General Assembly. The timehas now come for this body to allow Taiwan  a majorplayer in the international economic system  to take itsrightful place in the United Nations. The Assemblycannot continue to ignore the plight of the 23 millionpeople of Taiwan. Solomon Islands regrets the mannerin which the Assembly has dealt with the issue allowing certain countries to dictate the agenda.With respect to the reform of the Secretariat Solomon Islands would like to see the Secretariatreflect the diversity of its membership. The currentrecruitment process of having external  rather than in-country  examinations has deterred potential applicantsfrom small island developing States from applying given the associated expenses.In conclusion  Solomon Islands supportsmultilateralism  and I assure the President of ourongoing support for United Nations reform."
"147",6269,"SLE",60,2005,"The delegation ofthe Republic of Sierra Leone wishes to express itsprofound appreciation for the significant contributionof the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session to the work of the Assembly and tocongratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of theleadership of this body at its sixtieth session. You andyour predecessor will always have a special place inthe history of the United Nations as Presidents of theGeneral Assembly at the height of the Organization’sreform process.The United Nations was founded on the principleof multilateral cooperation for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. For 60 years  it hasbeen the focus of its Members — rich and poor  bigand small — for carrying out that criticalresponsibility. Today  for many of its Members  theOrganization is the great hope  not only for theachievement of peace and security  but also for theattainment of every objective of human aspiration particularly development  human rights  freedom anddemocracy.The United Nations was designed to serve theworld of the aftermath of the Second World War — aworld different in many ways from today’s world. Thatis why my delegation has welcomed with totalcommitment reforms in the United Nations system toreflect the realities of today’s world  and we willcontinue to participate fully in the reform process.We welcome the outcome document (resolution60/1) of last week’s summit and applaud thenegotiations that led to its adoption by consensus. Thesuccess of those negotiations indicate that  in spite ofour differences and individual sovereign interests Member States recognize that we have more things incommon than things that divide us and that  for a betterworld  common interests must enjoy precedence overindividual interests.The rhetoric that has accompanied the outcomedocument has been impressive and reassuring especially for developing countries and countries inconflict or emerging from conflict. If those soothingstatements are matched by action  this year’s UnitedNations summit and General Assembly session willhave a landmark effect on the Organization and on theworld. We are optimistic that it will.This is the last Assembly session before thecompletion of the withdrawal of the United NationsMission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) at the end ofDecember. UNAMSIL has achieved successes that areunique in the history of United Nations peacekeepingefforts. Sierra Leoneans will forever remember thepositive difference that the Mission made in their2country’s crisis and in their lives. For that  we cannever sufficiently thank the United Nations and theentire international community for coming to ourrescue and for standing by us when we could not standalone. In particular  we are profoundly grateful tocountries that contributed troops to UNAMSIL andcountries that financially supported the Mission.With a tremendous feeling of relief  we welcomethe proposal to constitute an integrated United Nationsoffice to succeed UNAMSIL  with the objective ofsupporting Sierra Leone in continuing to addresscritical areas of concern  including the causes of theconflict  consolidating the peace  human rights development  legal  judicial and governance reforms the rule of law and security. That measure has allayedthe fears of Sierra Leoneans that UNAMSIL’sdeparture would create a security vacuum and wouldmark the end of programmes associated with theMission. We eagerly look forward to yet anothersuccess in the United Nations peacekeeping experimentin Sierra Leone.Today  the Organization is preparing to transformits peacekeeping functions in Sierra Leone to meetsome of the post-conflict needs of the country. That isa landmark decision that could serve as a model foreffective coordination of strategies and programmesamong the United Nations  its agencies andprogrammes  and organizations and developmentpartners in countries emerging from conflict.We note with interest that the architecture andplans for the operation of the new integrated officewere based on close and extensive cooperation amongrelevant parties of the United Nations Secretariat andvarious United Nations agencies and organizations thatconstituted the country team. Sierra Leone hopes thatthat process of consultation and cooperation willcontinue. We urge the United Nations Mission to workclosely with existing national institutions and withother initiatives that we have set up over the past fiveyears to tackle post-conflict problems. We have nodoubt that the new office will provide a “guinea pig”for the work of the proposed United NationsPeacebuilding Commission  to which we will spare noeffort to lend support.As members are aware  it is not enough toestablish these short-term yet essential post-conflictbridges; what we desperately need is the mobilizationof resources  including those required for capacity-building for sustainable economic and socialdevelopment. The objective is not merely to ensure thatSierra Leone and other countries emerging fromconflict do not slide back into conflict; rather  theultimate objective must be to ensure that SierraLeoneans do not remain in abject poverty.The creation of the Peacebuilding Commissionwill be in consonance with the views expressed by mycountry’s President five years ago when  from thisrostrum at the Millennium Summit  he spoke about theimperative of adaptation by the United Nations. Hepleaded with the Organization to continue to adapt andequip itself to deal with the perennial problems andnew manifestations of human insecurity andunderdevelopment. He also spoke about some of theways in which Sierra Leone had tested the capacity ofthe United Nations to adapt itself to respond to localand global challenges.The three main elements — development  peaceand security and human rights — highlighted in theSecretary-General’s report entitled “In larger freedom”(A/59/2005) and in the outcome document (resolution60/1) of last week’s High-level Plenary Meeting are allinterrelated. However  as the document states development is a central goal by itself. That is why noone should be surprised at the importance that SierraLeone — a poor country emerging from a devastatingconflict — attaches to the development cluster of theoutcome document  including the section on ways inwhich to meet the special needs of Africa.The people of Sierra Leone continue to attachimportance to the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs) and to the commitments our heads of State orGovernment made in the Assembly five years ago. Theprincipal purpose of the just-concluded High-levelPlenary Meeting was to renew our determination tofulfil those commitments.The General Assembly would be interested toknow that the food security objective of ensuring bythe year 2007 that no Sierra Leonean goes to bedhungry is consistent with  and directly linked to  theMDGs; so are the objectives embodied in our PovertyReduction Strategy Paper. We are determined tocontinue to work with our development partners toachieve those objectives.For the overwhelming majority of us  “freedomfrom want” means the collective national andinternational responsibility to eradicate extreme3poverty  the collective responsibility to ensure thatpeople in all regions of the world enjoy  first andforemost  their human right to food  basic health care education  clean water and other amenities that sustainlife. As we see it  “freedom from fear” means thecollective responsibility of all States to remove andeliminate threats to the safety and security of peopleeverywhere  such as the illicit traffic and use of smallarms and the accumulation of nuclear and otherweapons of mass destruction. “Freedom from want”and “freedom from fear” also imply the responsibilityto accept without reservation the relationship betweendisarmament and development.Furthermore  “freedom to live in dignity” impliesthe collective responsibility of all States to ensure thattheir peoples are treated with dignity. This includes theprotection of all the economic  social  cultural  politicaland civil rights enshrined in the Universal Declarationof Human Rights. In our view  that responsibilityimplies cooperation and assistance where necessary toenhance the capacity for prevention and protection. Inthis connection  Sierra Leone is grateful for theassistance it continues to receive from the UnitedNations in the field of human rights.Sierra Leone has continued to make giant stridesin all areas of human endeavour since the end of armedconflict in 2002. Since then  presidential parliamentary and local elections — the latter usheringin a revival of local government that had been dormantfor nearly 30 years — have been held in conformitywith democratic principles and practice. We are nowpreparing for the 2007 presidential and parliamentaryelections to consolidate further our gains in thedemocratic process.Sierra Leone believes that children are the bestinvestment to ensure a bright future for our country.Consequently  we hold the view that development andrespect for human rights start with them and that theMillennium Development Goals are a critical tool forachieving those goals. That is why we have increasedthe space devoted to education  as indicated byenrolment figures that have jumped from 659 503 inthe 2001-2002 academic year to 1 158 399 in 2003-2004 — this in a country whose total population is5 million.We believe that the sound administration ofjustice  in particular strict adherence to the rule of lawand human rights  is indispensable to attaining durablepeace and political stability. Accordingly  theGovernment has re-established civil authoritythroughout Sierra Leone through the reopening andstrengthening of judicial and law enforcementinstitutions  and we are in the process of establishing anational human rights commission.Two transitional institutions  the Truth andReconciliation Commission  which has just publishedits report  and the Special Court  have contributedimmensely to the peace process. It is the Government’sintention to implement the Commission’srecommendations  to which we attach great importanceas a crucial instrument of durable peace.Let me take this opportunity to appeal to theUnited Nations  the international community and ourfriends to support the Special Court to enable it toaccomplish its mandate.There is no doubt that the United Nations and theinternational community have made important stridesin addressing impunity. However  it is our belief thatthe international community should do more thansupport the international tribunals  truth andreconciliation commissions and other mechanisms of atransitional justice system. It is our fervent hope thatthe process of peace and reconciliation in Sierra Leonewill not end with the report of the Truth andReconciliation Commission or the end of the work ofthe Special Court. Reconciliation would be incompletewithout addressing the special needs of the victims ofthe heinous crimes that were perpetrated on civiliansduring the armed conflict.I solemnly appeal to the international communityto assist us in supporting victims of war crimes andcrimes against humanity. Within its limited resources the Government has made every effort to address thespecial needs of the victims of the heinous crimescommitted during the 11-year rebel armed conflict. Butwe need international support for these victimsthrough  for instance  the Special Fund for War Victimsenvisaged under the 1999 Lomé Peace Agreement andthe National Commission for War-Affected Children.This address would be incomplete withoutreference to the security situation in the West Africansubregion. While Sierra Leone is enjoying relativepeace and stability and the capacity of its securityforces continues to be enhanced by the InternationalMilitary Advisory and Training Team  there is still anair of uncertainty in the neighbourhood and the4subregion. Because of the porosity of the borders andthe historically fluid nature of the conflict in thesubregion  we will feel safe and secure only in aconflict-free region.In the light of this  I would like to appeal to theUnited Nations  the international community and ourfriends to continue to support measures to resolve theconflicts that have plagued the subregion for so longand diverted scarce resources and energy fromdevelopment. But let me remind members about theimperative of recognizing the fact that the achievementof lasting peace requires wholesome measure for theentire subregion. In particular  we recommend asubregional approach by the United Nations  theAfrican Union  the European Union  the EconomicCommunity of West African States and other interestedparties to post-conflict activities  includingdisarmament  demobilization and reintegration security-sector reform and post-conflict peacebuilding.Finally  at the time of the debate of the sixtiethsession of the General Assembly  we should bereminded that the United Nations is and should remainat the centre of efforts to harmonize activities to attainits common objectives. This Organization belongs to usall and operates in the larger interest of all itsmembers. Let this sixtieth anniversary be a time forrecommitment to the principles and purposes of theCharter  a time for renewed determination to build onthe successes of this great Organization."
"148",6316,"SLV",60,2005," Iwish to begin  Mr. President  by congratulating you onyour election to lead our work during this session. Wewish you full success during your presidency.Likewise  our gratitude goes to His Excellency Mr JeanPing for his work during his mandate. We also extendour heartfelt thanks to Secretary-General Kofi Annanfor his devotion as head of the Organization.The anniversary we are now celebrating shouldinspire an appreciation of the importance of dialogueamong all the nations represented here in achievingcollective well-being. Above all  we must recognizethe challenges ahead. We all know that ourOrganization is passing through a crucial moment in itsexistence. We can either strengthen it or weaken it. Ireaffirm the commitment of my Government toparticipate significantly in pursuing the reform process in particular in substantive areas in which we have yetto achieve agreement and which are essential forsuccessful reform of our Organization.The historic process in El Salvador has shownthat lasting peace and democracy cannot exist withoutdevelopment and respect for human rights. Myadministration is doing everything possible to maintaina humanistic form of government focusing on peopleand their expectations and placing economic and socialdevelopment at the heart of our programmes.As a developing country  however  we areconstrained by limited natural  technical and financialresources. Sometimes  these limitations are increasedas the result of natural events and other external factorssuch as the increase in oil prices which is trulydevastating to our economies.2At last year’s General Assembly session  weexpressed the need to find solutions to the impact of oilprices on economies. Since then  we have witnessedwith great concern that the prices of hydrocarbonproducts  far from dropping or stabilizing  havespiralled excessively as never before. This situation notonly seriously affects our development efforts becauseof the high oil bills  which lead us to divert funds thatcould be used for social programmes  but also hasbecome a serious threat to social and political stabilityand human security  primarily in the least developedand other developing countries.In addition to those conditions and other factorsrelated to instability and price speculation  there is agrowing trend to exclude middle-low-income countriesfrom assistance and international cooperation  furtherlimiting the ability of those States to meet thechallenge of development and in particular ofachieving the Millennium Development Goals. Wefirmly believe that the United Nations must discuss thisissue with due seriousness and responsibility in orderto find joint and supportive solutions that will helpmitigate the crisis we are facing.I propose that the Department of Economic andSocial Affairs or the Economic Commission for LatinAmerica and the Caribbean carry out a study on theimpact of increased oil prices on achievement of theMillennium Development Goals and on nationaldevelopment efforts worldwide.Although South-South cooperation has become avaluable instrument that contributes to development  itis also important to recognize that further use shouldbe made of North-South cooperation  in particularthrough creation of the Global Development Alliance which will make it possible  through a mutuallybeneficial approach  to achieve economic growth andsustainable social well-being.We feel that it is essential that as part of thecomprehensive reform of our Organization we promotethe strengthening and greater efficiency of funds andprogrammes in the operational activities of the UnitedNations system. Similarly  I would like to highlight theimportance of setting up a just and equitableinternational trade system  based on predictable andnon-discriminatory regulations consistent with theprinciples of free trade.El Salvador is committed to achieving theMillennium Development Goals that have been set for2015  despite external factors that affect us and limitour capacity to invest in development. With that visionin mind  El Salvador has launched its Opportunitiesprogramme aimed at improving the living conditions ofthousands of Salvadorian families. It contains fivebasic components. The first is the Solidarity Networkprogramme to combat poverty and extreme povertyhead on  with a special role for Salvadorian women.Through the Chair of the Commission on Women  weare doing everything we can to ensure that protectingthe rights of women is on the agenda. We can confirmthat the participation of women in peace anddevelopment has been essential for successfullyachieving our goals.Secondly  the programme covers microcredit fordeveloping micro and small businesses; this willpromote the development of new sources of incomethrough self-employment.Thirdly  the Health Solidarity Fund (FOSALUD)provides for the establishment of a tax on tobacco alcohol and firearms. Those resources will be used toexpand medical services in public health units to 24hours a day; here  we have seen excellent results.Fourthly  the Presidential Youth Programme hasbegun to include young people in the developmentprocess.Finally  our Get Connected programme is aimedat creating a model for public education that makestechnology and information available to students.It is with great hope that El Salvador is graduallymoving towards achieving most of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. For example  we reduced thenumber of individuals living in extreme poverty by18 percentage points between 1991 and 2004. Thepercentages have gone from 33 per cent to 15 per cent which means we have reduced the figure by half. Theinfant mortality rate for children under the age of onehas decreased significantly  from 45 per 1 000 livebirths in 1991 to 25 per 1 000 in 2004: a reduction of20 points. We need to strive for a further 10-pointreduction.Participation of young people in economic andsocial development is a priority. It is a source of energyand creativity that can improve our society and put uson the path to the future.We also welcome the holding of the second phaseof the World Summit on the Information Society  to be3held in Tunis in November 2005. We urge participantsto be active in agreeing on commitments  with specificobjectives that will help reduce the digital divideseparating countries. Like that of the first phase  heldin Geneva in 2003  the outcome of the 2005 TunisSummit on the Information Society should reflect deeprespect for freedom of expression as a pillar ofdemocracy in order to ensure that a free andindependent press continues to work unhinderedthroughout the world  as expressed in article 19 of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.The HIV/AIDS pandemic has become a seriousproblem that crosses borders and does not respectnationalities. The magnitude of the spread of thisepidemic has meant that we must concentrate onprevention without forgetting treatment and support forindividuals living with this illness.In El Salvador  we shall shortly host the thirdForum on HIV/AIDS and Sexually TransmittedDiseases in Latin America and the Caribbean  thefourth Central American Congress on SexuallyTransmitted Infections and HIV/AIDS and the fourthCentral American Meeting of People Living withHIV/AIDS in order to unite our efforts and exchangeexperiences. We are hoping to have support from theUnited Nations. We urge the entire internationalcommunity  in particular the donor countries  tocontinue to provide their support to national efforts tocombat HIV/AIDS and to reduce the costs of themedications that are available.One of the matters that require greater interestand attention is that of migration because of itseconomic  social and cultural impact in countries oforigin  transit and destination.This matter should be dealt with from amultidimensional approach  one that would establishguidelines for international  regional and subregionalcooperation  adopt and coordinate joint policies basedon the contribution of migrants to development  as wellas prevention efforts and action against illegalimmigration and the trade in human beings.One matter of particular interest to El Salvador isthe scourge of national and transnational organizedcrime. The phenomenon of gangs is closely connectedto a series of serious offences that gravely threaten thesecurity of individuals and their assets. It also has abearing on corruption; it reduces our people’s moraleand it has a negative impact on our developmentefforts. We believe that one of the measures that oughtto be taken collectively to most effectively andefficiently combat this scourge would be to strengthenthe capacity of the United Nations Office on Drugs andCrime  and to enhance international cooperation.We agree that the system to protect human rightsneeds to be strengthened but it is necessary to establishan objective mechanism that is transparent de-politicized and non-discriminatory.El Salvador fully supports the strengthening ofthe collective security system  with full respect for theprinciples of the Charter and universally recognizedhuman rights. We recognize and appreciate the roleplayed by peacekeeping operations. We feel it isimportant to continue considering the proposal ofestablishing a strategic military and police reserve thatwould allow for rapid deployment to deal withhostilities stemming from conflicts  as well as tomaintain post-conflict peace and security.We are satisfied with our contribution tocollective peace with our growing participation inpeacekeeping operations. In particular  we providetroops from our national civil police as a result ofpeace agreements worked out and signed with theUnited Nations.With regard to disarmament and nuclearnon-proliferation  El Salvador supports the effortsaimed at reaching a global commitment to eliminateweapons of mass destruction. In this regard  wesupport Norway’s initiative to adopt a declaration ondisarmament and security.As to the situation in the Middle East  we wish toexpress our gratitude to the Government of Israel forcarrying out its disengagement plan  a unilateralmeasure that will conclude with the total withdrawal ofthe Israeli presence from the Gaza Strip. This is a showof political will and the desire to put a lasting end tothe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We believe thatcontinuing to adopt measures to generate mutual trustwill enable both parties to resume the peace process  asset out in the road map. Similarly  we reiterate oursupport for the right of the Palestinian people toestablish an independent State  as well as the right ofthe Israeli people to live in peace and security  freefrom any terrorist threat from radical groups outsidethe law.4With respect to the situation in Iraq  we trust thatall political forces will participate in setting up newinstitutions for Iraq and that there will be anunderstanding which will lead to the establishment of astate of law based on representative democracy.One of the pending items on the internationalagenda that we must not disregard is the situationrelated to Taiwan and its inclusion in the concert ofnations. We believe that the United Nations must lookinto the question of Taiwan  because it is a reality thatwe cannot ignore  since the representation of theTaiwanese people internationally is a responsibility ofthis Organization  in accordance with its universalprinciples and purposes. Similarly  we hope that therewill be peaceful coexistence on both sides of theTaiwan Strait.I now wish to refer to the question of naturaldisasters and the high level of vulnerability to whichall of our nations are exposed  as seen by the tragicevents that took place recently in various parts of theworld  and most recently in the United States. Thisshould lead us to rethink and reassess our commitmentsand our decisions with respect to the environmentalsituation in which we find ourselves. On behalf of theGovernment and people of El Salvador  I wish toexpress our most sincere condolences and our show ofsolidarity to all families who lost loved ones andvaluables as a result of these phenomena  and we urgethe community of nations to pay greater attention to theenvironment.Finally  I simply wish to point out that our peoplefirmly believe and hope that the United Nations is andwill be an Organization that has legitimacy and thecapacity to contribute to the attainment of peace security  freedom  sustainable development and thepromotion of human rights. Our role as heads of Stateand Government is to strengthen this belief and thishope  showing that we can work together in a unitedfashion to achieve concrete results for the well being ofour people throughout the world."
"149",6341,"SMR",60,2005,"On behalf ofthe Government of the Republic of San Marino  I wishto congratulate Ambassador Jan Eliasson on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at itssixtieth session. I also wish to express to the outgoingPresident  Mr. Jean Ping  our deepest gratitude for hiscommitment and determination in fulfilling hismandate.At the outset  I would also like to express myappreciation for the result of the outcome document. Iam confident that  with a clear mandate for our headsof State and Government  we will be able to reach ourgoals.The United Nations is at an extremely importantand critical juncture. Indeed  the challenge of UnitedNations reform has become inevitable and necessary inlaying the foundations of its future activity. It is nowall too clear that the reform will involve its majorbodies  working methods and management of humanand economic resources. The United Nations structurewill be modified with the aim of showing the entireworld that the Organization is an efficient and16democratic body that can guarantee peace anddevelopment.The reform  which will lead to tension andrequire sacrifices  will be criticized by a number ofStates  as is the case with all difficult compromises.The process will be long and encounter numerousobstacles  but it is necessary and indispensable.San Marino believes that the reform processalready under way will not stop. However  changes willhave to be wide-ranging and take account of the needto face important issues  such as the reform of theSecurity Council. Most importantly  the reform willhave to be supported by the widest possible consensusand based on two principles: democracy andtransparency. We hope the enlargement will take intoaccount the widest possible geographical and regionalrepresentation and that the solution’s methods andideas will not be forcibly imposed or privilege theinterests of only a few countries. We endorse theprinciples of “Uniting for consensus” and are ready toconsider any proposal that does not create fractures andcan establish a new and lasting balance.For San Marino  the United Nations must bebased upon democracy  which gives it its legitimacyand moral strength. Streamlining structures andprocedures is also necessary to greater effectiveness because it is in the field  among people  that the UnitedNations really fulfils its mission. Indeed  it is thepeople who determine the importance of thisOrganization in the improvement of their lives.With regard to some essential aspects presentlyunder discussion  San Marino feels that the proposedcreation of a human rights council may not solve thebasic problem of the Commission on Human Rights which is politicization. However  San Marino is of theview that human rights protection deserves the sameconsideration given by the Economic and SocialCouncil to social and economic aspects and by theSecurity Council to peace and security.The human rights council should be directlyaccountable to the General Assembly and have abroad-based composition allowing for the adequateparticipation of small and medium-sized countries.Moreover  the specific competencies of the newcouncil vis-à-vis the Third Committee should beestablished in order to avoid duplication of activitiesand inefficiencies.The proposed peacebuilding commission is anexcellent institutional response to post-conflictsituations. The commission should play an importantrole not only in the resolution  but also in theprevention of conflicts. Moreover  it should find ad hocsolutions for countries in transition fromtotalitarianism or institutional anarchy to democracy.In our view  the commission should submitrecommendations to the Security Council on measuresto be adopted to guarantee consistency in peaceinterventions  economic recovery processes  therebuilding of national institutions and publicadministration  and the strengthening of democracyand the rule of law. Moreover  we believe that theCommission should be composed of members of theSecurity Council and the Economic and SocialCouncil  as well as of countries directly involved inspecific situations.Just a few days ago  the majority of the worldleaders gathered in this very Hall to discuss what hasbeen done so far to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Over the past five years development assistance activities have fallen short ofexpectations. We sincerely hope that the recentlyconcluded summit will promote and encourage strongercommitment by all developed and developingcountries.San Marino has followed very attentively thereform process initiated by the Secretary-General andhas actively participated in the discussions of thePanel’s report and of the Secretary-General’s reportentitled “In larger freedom”  as well as in thenegotiations of the outcome document of the GeneralAssembly. We would have liked the latter document tocontain more incisive and comprehensive proposals.San Marino is aware that development is the sinequa non condition for achieving the Millennium Goals.Today  in the twenty-first century  more than a billionpeople still live on less than a dollar a day and 30 000children die every day from hunger. Those figurescannot leave us indifferent. Only by eradicatingpoverty  underdevelopment and epidemics  and byforgiving the crushing debt of developing countries will collective well-being be achieved.Peace and security are intimately linked to theMillennium Goals  as they are essential for a country toimprove its economic and human conditions. Peace andsecurity cannot be separated from concerns about17terrorism  as evidenced by the numerous recentcowardly attacks. Terrorism must not divert theinternational community from its commitment topromoting democratization  the culture of peace andrespect for religions  ethnic groups and differentcultures.All States must share the responsibility forfighting terrorism and cooperate at the regional andinternational levels to implement specific and effectivepreventive measures. Every State must adopt thenecessary legislation to break the vicious cycle ofterrorism and to prevent its financing througheconomic and banking cooperation.The principle of “the responsibility to protect” isan extremely interesting concept. That idea  however can be accepted only if understood not as a violation ofnational sovereignty  but as a duty of all States vis-à-vis countries plagued by massacres  genocide andhumanitarian crises.San Marino is closely following developments inthe peace process in the Middle East. The decision ofthe Israeli Government to remove its settlers from theGaza Strip and the West Bank has been one of the mostsignificant steps in the implementation of the road mapand Prime Minister Sharon has showed great courageand determination  despite all domestic difficulties  intaking such a decision.San Marino shares the hope of the internationalcommunity that the Palestinian Government will alsofully respect its commitments and  by completelyrejecting terrorism perpetrated by extremist groups will maintain and strengthen the dialogue andconstructive relations responsibly established with theIsraeli Government.We welcome with great satisfaction the recentelections held in the new Afghanistan  now on its wayto democracy and with a higher degree of freedom  aswell as the elections and approval of the newConstitution in Iraq  which we hope may lead to a realinstitutional  social and cultural rebirth of that country.We cannot fail to address and stress the situationof women and children in our discussions on theconcerns to be addressed at the beginning of thisMillennium and on the development of humankind.Children  in particular  are most vulnerable to war andfamine and bear the brunt of adult actions anddecisions. Bombings and conflicts  malnutrition poverty  treatable diseases  child labour and sexualabuse cause them great suffering and death. If peoplewere merely to stop and think of those children  manyof the worst events in the world could be avoided.This year  my country has undertaken a numberof humanitarian initiatives in favour of children mainly in Africa  with the support of our institutions.Let me mention  in that regard  the recent unanimousdecision of my Parliament in favour of programmesimproving childhood conditions in Uganda.Poverty and hunger are the prison in which manywomen eke out their existence  victims of injustice anddiscrimination. Our inability to free those women despite all the means available  is one of the majorscandals of our day. At a time of economic well-beingand progress  though not widespread  complicity withthat injustice through negligence or incapacity isunacceptable. The mass media now at our disposal donot allow us to ignore that situation. Theimplementation of Beijing and Beijing+5 is crucial todemolishing the walls of that prison and toguaranteeing respect and development for the womenof the twenty-first century.Last year  San Marino ratified the Convention onthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen and  last June  Parliament approved accessionto its Optional Protocol. I deposited our instruments ofaccession upon my arrival here in New York.Moreover  San Marino is tirelessly committed tosupporting women’s complete integration into andequality in its society.On this occasion  I would express the hope thatthe international community will strengthen its effortsto protect the environment and prevent naturaldisasters. To that end  international cooperation is ofthe utmost importance  and the Kyoto Protocol is aparticularly important instrument for our country.On that subject  I wish to reiterate my country’scondolences and solidarity to the people tragicallystruck by natural disasters  such as those in South-EastAsia some months ago and  more recently  along thecoasts of the Gulf of Mexico in the United States ofAmerica.The Millennium Development Goals  peaceprocesses  fighting injustice and our many other greatchallenges may seem impossible to face  buthumankind has the necessary resources and18instruments to achieve those objectives and the UnitedNations is one of the major tools at our disposal. I amconfident that the Organization will be up to that nobletask. To that end  I express my most sincere wishes toyou  Sir  to the Secretary-General and to all colleagues diplomats and officials who believe in the ideals of theUnited Nations."
"150",6378,"SOM",60,2005,"On behalf of the Republic ofSomalia I am very pleased to address this summit herein New York marking the sixtieth anniversary ofUnited Nations and the fifth anniversary of theMillennium Summit  which agreed on a number ofMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reducepoverty by 50 per cent by the year 2015. We believethat the eight MDGs are desirable and lofty ones  andwe fully endorse them. Unfortunately  given thecircumstances of conflict in Somalia  we are unlikelyto attain all of them. However  we are confident thatsome progress will certainly be made.With regard to the reform of the United Nations Somalia has committed itself to the position taken bythe African Union (AU) at Sirte  Libya.I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirmSomaliaís appreciation for  and approval of  the UnitedNations 60 years of progressive work to maintain peacewhile concurrently achieving incremental progresstowards a more equitable and liveable world. Thehistory of the United Nations involvement in Somaliais a good example of its invaluable role in helping theemerging nations of the world. Despite momentarysetbacks  the United Nations has taken a laudable roleat each juncture of Somaliaís history  from colonialismto independence and throughout our nationhood.Nothing better demonstrates the importance ofthe United Nations than the nurturing role it playedduring the sad days of our 15-year-long civil war.While assisting the destitute and providing safesanctuary for an exodus of Somali refugees toneighbouring countries and elsewhere  the UnitedNations had the political will to invoke the morallycompelling doctrine of humanitarian intervention thereby successfully reversing a calamitous famine thatcould potentially have wiped out millions of Somalis.Moreover  during the two years that the SomaliaNational Reconciliation Conference met at Nairobi Kenya  the United Nations played a helpful role insuccessfully finding a lasting and comprehensivesettlement to Somalia's political crisis. The currentTransitional Federal Government of Somalia is theoutcome of that political settlement. Allow me torestate here Somaliaís indebtedness and profoundappreciation to those who selflessly helped us duringthe Somali National Reconciliation Conference  as wellas to those who continue to help us in our currentpursuit of a peaceful and well-governed Somalia.Among others  special gratitude goes to the AfricanUnion  the Intergovernmental Authority onDevelopment  the League of Arab States and theEuropean Union  as well as to the Government ofKenya  for patiently and generously hosting and payingfor our long peace process.25With regard to relocating to Somalia  the nascentTransitional Federal Government could not just sit byand wait until the international community acted. Ittherefore took the daring unilateral initiative  on13 June 2005  to relocate itself from Nairobi toSomalia with minimal help. To the dismay of mostsceptics  the massive relocation scheme was completedwithout any incident. The entire Government is now onSomali soil. It is my judgement that we owe a statusreport to those who earnestly wanted to witness the riseof Somalia from the ashes. That report will also beuseful to those who may continue to doubt theeffectiveness of the Transitional Federal Governmentin extricating Somalia from its current predicament ofchaos and lawlessness.The Government has continued to tackle thedaunting tasks inside Somalia at a much faster pacethan the international community could haveanticipated. What is significant here is that theTransitional Federal Government is being helped by ahidden hand that most observers and political analystsof Somalia have typically regarded as a wild card or atotally incalculable factor. They have never clearlyunderstood the importance of correctly accounting forthe level of popular support that the new SomaliGovernment enjoyed upon relocating to Somalia. Thehigh popularity of the Transitional Federal Governmentwithin Somalia turned out to be so strong that theGovernment owes its very survival to the admirationand active support it receives from the localpopulation. That factor alone has proven to be morecrucial to the survival of the Transitional FederalGovernment than any other form of assistance.With the support of its citizens  the newGovernment has already proceeded to consolidate thegains and the outcome of the reconciliation process with the aim of addressing the formidable expectationsof the Somali people. As a result  I can confidentlyreport to the Assembly today that our efforts atreclaiming Somalia from its lawlessness are alreadyunder way and have already produced concrete resultson the ground.The Government has made phenomenal progressin the little more than three months since its relocation.Progress has been made in the recruitment and trainingof a modest security force comprised of personnel fromall of Somaliaís regions; in the extension of Stateauthority over much of Somalia; in winning theallegiance and support of regional leaders and theSomali public at large; in earning and assuming themoral leadership of the nation through responsiblegovernance and peaceful means; and in creatingoverarching political momentum that powerfullyaugurs for the sure attainment of durable peace andcontinuity in Somalia.Contrary to the fears some may have had therefore  the advent of the Transitional FederalGovernment did not turn out to be some kind of cruelhoax or yet another false start for Somalia. Thesensible actions undertaken by the new Governmentinside Somalia have already established its legitimacyand the kind of moral leadership it enjoys insideSomalia. The Government is serious and committed tothe basic social contract it made with its citizens namely  to guarantee peace and security to its people inreturn for the allegiance they have already conferredupon their Government.There is clearly a unique chance for theTransitional Federal Government to restore normalcy legitimacy and lasting peace to Somalia. Regrettably however  the situation is not tenable in the long term.The challenges that are hampering the Governmentísefforts on the ground are all related to the indifferenceof the international community. We believe that theinternational community has a moral obligation to helpthe new Somali Government in its quest for peace stability  territorial integrity and unity in the country ina manner consistent with the United Nations Charter.Now is the time when the international communitymust assist Somalia in a strong and decisive manner byaddressing the following three challenges.One of the challenges for the new Government isthat most of the international community has yet tohonour its obligations with regard to ensuring apeaceful and well-governed Somalia. Even much of itsinitial cheerful pledges to provide material andfinancial support to the Government have yet to reachus. Consequently  its actual role in our efforts on theground remain very confusing to us. We do notunderstand the new ambivalence of the internationalcommunity  which seems to have moderated its initialenthusiasm to offer Somalia a consolidated rapidassistance programme.In order to address that situation  the internationalcommunity must help Somalia by providing thenecessary financial and political support for the rapidrehabilitation of infrastructures to house the new26Government  to provide for budgetary and otheradministrative expenditures  and to tackle the securityissues such as recruiting a national police force pacification programmes and the implementation ofdemobilization  disarmament and reintegrationprogrammes.Another puzzling and more serious problem forthe new Government of Somalia is the United Nationsarms embargo on Somalia. The embargo directlyundermines the Governmentís genuine efforts to form anational security force ó to which it has an inherentright in order to protect the public and keep the peaceby enforcing law and order throughout Somalia. Inaddition  it discourages friendly countries that arewilling to offer help to Somalia from doing so especially in the areas of security and the rule of law.Moreover  the embargo has delayed the formaldeployment of the African peace support mission inSomalia  whose mandate is to protect the Governmentand its premises during its capacity-building stage aswell as to help the Government form and train nationalsecurity forces.It does not make sense to help Somalis reach acomprehensive political settlement of their longconflict while at the same time denying them theability to build the institutions through which they canovercome lawlessness in their country. With thecreation of the new Government and its relocation toSomalia  the political conditions and realities thatprompted the United Nations to impose an armsembargo no longer prevail. Whose interests andpurposes does the embargo continue to serve now thatthere is a legitimate Government functioning inSomalia? In the same vein  in reflecting on the absurdposition of a nation or Government whose capacity toinstitute its own law enforcement bodies is neutralized one wonders what the political or moral relevance ofkeeping Somalia handcuffed by the old embargo canpossibly be? To address that predicament we call onthe Security Council to assist the efforts of theTransitional Federal Government to stabilize thecountry by reviewing the merits of the arms embargoon Somalia and promptly lifting it.Finally  the disintegration of the State and theabsence of law and order have led to widespreadcriminal activity by individuals and groups forfinancial gain  including by war profiteers andterrorists. Those individuals and groups believe that thestatus quo in Somalia favours them  and they willtherefore do whatever they can to resist the return oflaw and order to Somalia  including by renewing activehostilities. To address that possible scenario the UnitedNations must establish punitive and targeted sanctionsagainst those who try to spoil Somaliaís chance forlasting peace by undermining the ongoing efforts topacify the country and by frustrating the effectivenessof the Government in upholding the primacy of the ruleof law.The cost of the prolonged Somali civil war isenormous in terms of its direct social  economic political and environmental impacts. There is nowclearly a rare chance for my country to overcome thosenegative impacts. The performance of the TransitionalFederal Government on the ground and the overallpolitical environment in Somalia are very promising.Both Africa and the region have been very forthcomingin helping Somalia. It is imperative that the rest of theinternational community extend its help to Somalia byadopting the three proposals just outlined  therebyeffectively ending the plight of Somalia once and forall.Allow me here to make my personal appeal to theworld summit not to leave Somalia out in the cold inthis crucial period of its pacification and nation-building. While many of the countries of the world arestruggling to meet their Millennium DevelopmentGoals  Somalia is struggling to stand on its feet. Itwould be grave negligence on the part of theinternational community if it fails to fulfil itsobligations towards Somalia in a timely and decisivemanner."
"151",6416,"STP",60,2005,"First  Sir  I should like to extend my sincere congratulations to you on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly and to wish you the greatest success in conducting the work of the Assembly. I am also pleased to take this opportunity to offer my sincere thanks to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Gabonese Republic  for the considerable results produced during his term as President  especially towards the end of the session  when we reviewed matters related to the implementation of the Millennium Goals and the reform of the United Nations.  I should also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his valuable efforts to bolster and propel the role of the United Nations in international peacekeeping  security and development. The report by Mr. Kofi Annan (A/59/2005) and the recommendations set out in it provide us with important elements capable of leading to consensus on strategies that will help us to achieve the Millennium Goals and to make progress on reforming the United Nations.  I cannot fail to take advantage of this opportunity  on behalf of the people of Sao Tome and Principe  to reiterate to the Government and the people of the United States of America and to the bereaved families our sincere condolences regarding the tragedy caused by Hurricane Katrina. These difficult times  being experienced by a large part of the American people  cannot leave us indifferent  above all because we are fully aware of the role that the American people and its Government play in international solidarity and cooperation  constantly seeking peace and prosperity for peoples in difficulty  and of their support and financing of this great Organization.  From the early days of the signing of the Charter in 1945 in San Francisco  the United Nations has played a crucial role in undertaking many matters of a political  economic  social and humanitarian nature throughout the world. Nevertheless  it seems to us that the world now needs a stronger and more dynamic United Nations. The present session takes place in a very complex international environment. Indeed  the climate of permanent tension experienced in some parts of the world  the unbridled arms race  human trafficking  cross-border organized crime  terrorism  systematic violations of human rights  economic depression and environmental degradation constitute important matters that are in need of the attention of the United Nations now and in the years to come. In the face of such challenges  Member States must manifest a sense of wisdom and responsibility in order for an international order based on peace  security and cooperation to prevail.  Small island States met this year in Mauritius to evaluate the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. In Mauritius  States reaffirmed their    14 05-51226  commitment to support the efforts of small island developing States that would lead to sustainable development through a greater and more effective implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action. Decisions and recommendations were adopted on climate change  natural and environmental disasters  water resources  waste management  tourism  energy  transportation  biodiversity and marine and coastal resources. All the problems that affect small island States  from global warming to ecosystem problems  can be resolved only if the international community makes an effort to effectively increase the resources that will support the sustained development of small island States. In this regard  we would like to take the opportunity to express our thanks both to the international community and to the Government of Mauritius for the efforts made to organize the special conference.  International security is based on the protection of the people and on education for capacity-building  promoting a community’s development. Nations that do not pay attention those factors could be in a state of permanent tension  which is not conducive to progress. For this reason HIV/AIDS  poverty  political crises  ongoing violations of human rights  oppression and occupation constitute threats to human security.   Many of our countries continue to face challenges in combating HIV/AIDS and other illnesses. In some regions of Africa HIV/AIDS is devastating families  cultures and economies — entire societies. The cost of treatment continues to be extremely high and our economies are beginning to buckle under the effects of the illness. If significant resources and additional scientific investment for research to seek a cure for HIV/AIDS are not forthcoming the development expectations of Africa will be far from being met.  Very recently the Republic of Angola was attacked by the worst outbreak ever of Marburg fever  caused by a virus related to the Ebola virus. We are concerned because Sao Tome and Principe  being an integral part of the Central African States  cannot remove itself from that situation. We appeal to the World Health Organization (WHO) to strengthen the capabilities of the countries of the subregion by holding seminars and providing training. This initiative will help us to deal prophylactically with similar situations that might arise. Likewise  malaria continues to be a serious public health problem for my country despite its active involvement with existing programmes supported by several countries and organizations.  The situation of insecurity primarily affects the most vulnerable populations  especially refugees  children  women and the elderly. Terrorism is destabilizing Governments  destroying lives and claiming innocent victims. We are faced with a challenge that requires reformulating our strategies to combat it. It seems entirely appropriate to start with an understanding of the origins of the problem by identifying its causes  and then to forge new consensuses and improve the methods of combating the problem and implementing Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). However  the United Nations must take additional action to benefit States which  like my own  are not in a position to fully comply with all the provisions of that resolution. We need resources that will contribute to the improvement  inter alia  of our security  including control of our borders and territorial waters. Here  strengthening our capability to fight the phenomenon of terrorism is a priority.  In my capacity as President of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries  I should like to refer to Guinea-Bissau  which has just successfully concluded a long and difficult political transition. First  let me congratulate the people and the authorities of that country on their success. I commend the international community  and in particular the United Nations and its Secretary-General  for its prompt contribution  which bolstered the people’s action for peace  stability and development. Now  Guinea-Bissau faces the giant task of promoting development and well-being for its population. The international community must therefore continue to provide its traditional help so that legitimate expectations may not be frustrated.  The universality of the Organization requires that all nations must be represented. However  this continues not to be so despite several calls for it. As we reflect on reforming the United Nations  we must once again take advantage of the opportunity from this rostrum to invite the international community to review the problem of the need for the Republic of China on Taiwan to be represented in the Organization. In this regard  my country signed the letter contained in document A/60/192 requesting the inclusion of an item in the agenda of the present session entitled “Question of the representation of the 23 million people of   05-51226 15  Taiwan in the United Nations”. Once again  we have lost an opportunity to correct this injustice.  We are further concerned by the recent adoption by the People’s Republic of China of the so-called anti-secession law  which  by increasing tension in the Strait of Taiwan  may compromise peace in the region. Aware of the role of the United Nations  specifically under the provisions of Articles 1 and 34 of the Charter  Sao Tome and Principe also joined in proposing the draft resolution annexed to document A/60/193. That document contains a letter requesting the inclusion of a supplementary item in the agenda of the present session entitled  “A proactive role for the United Nations in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait”. Neither proposal received the expected support.  We are faced with an excellent opportunity to infuse our Organization with greater dynamism and rationality  more action and less bureaucracy. Reform of the system is urgent. It is a high priority. To that end  we must all work without hesitation for the good of the world to which we belong. "
"152",6457,"SUR",60,2005,"It is a distinct honour forme today to address the sixtieth General Assembly ofthe United Nations. At the outset  please allow me onbehalf of the Government and people of the Republicof Suriname to extend sincere felicitations to thePresident on his election to preside over this importantsession. I would like to pledge my delegation’s fullsupport and cooperation in the tasks that lie ahead of usin this session.My delegation would also like to express itsgratitude to His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping  President ofthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations  for his unwavering efforts in steeringthe work of the fifty-ninth session. We wish him wellin his future endeavours.We continue to render our support to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  especially for his leadership inthe process of restructuring the United Nations.We are gathered here  in the wake of the High-level Plenary Meeting  in which world leaders adoptedsome measures to advance the cause of development human rights and security and the much-needed reformof this world Organization. The task before us is not aneasy one. We need to redouble our efforts inimplementing the ambitious goals we have set to createa safer and more prosperous world for ourselves andgenerations to come.Although the world community made somemodest progress towards achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  we have to acknowledge that weare far from reaching the global commitments made byworld leaders at the dawn of the new millennium toadvance economic and social development for theworld’s poor.The Government of Suriname remains committedto achieving the Millennium Development Goalsbecause we strongly believe that sustainabledevelopment is crucial for the achievement ofinternational peace and security.28While we acknowledge our primary responsibilityin the development process  we would like to bring tomind the commitments made in Monterrey ofestablishing a global partnership to advance thedevelopment agenda. A substantial increase in financialresources  to be provided on a more predictable basisand free of conditionalities  is needed for this matter.We commend the various initiatives that havebeen launched so far  and we would like to call on ourdeveloped partners to continue rendering their supportto the efforts of developing countries.Trade can play an important role in promotingeconomic growth and development  and in that regardwe reiterate our position for a trading system that isuniversal  rule-based  non-discriminatory  open andequitable. We furthermore expect that the upcomingmultilateral round of trade negotiations will fully takeinto account the needs of developing countries.We would like to note the laudable initiatives ofseveral developed countries for facilitating marketaccess for the least developed countries. However  formany middle-income countries  like Suriname  who arecalled upon to diversify their economies  measureshave yet to be taken to facilitate their market access forgoods and services into the markets of the developedcountries.Sixty years ago  in the aftermath of the SecondWorld War  world leaders vowed to save succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war and thus cametogether and established the United Nations. Facedwith both old and new challenges to internationalpeace and security  the international community shouldmore than ever be determined to live up to that crucialpromise.The spread of infectious diseases such asHIV/AIDS  the indiscriminate effect of the forces ofnature thereby causing widespread despair anddestruction  the uncontrolled proliferation of smallarms and light weapons  just to name a few  aretestimony of the transnational nature of contemporarychallenges the world is facing today.We therefore need an effective system ofinternational cooperation to collectively deal with bothold and new threats to international peace and security.It is imperative to redress the major setbacks innuclear disarmament and arms control. We will havefailed future generations if we cannot even reachagreement on the general principles governing thoseimportant issues.We cannot but agree with the Secretary-Generalwhen he once stated  “There is nothing small or lightabout the consequences of the uncontrolled spread andmisuse of small arms and light weapons” (A/58/138 p. 4). In Suriname  as is the case for many countries inthe Caribbean region  this phenomenon is associatedwith drug trafficking and other cross-border criminalactivity. In this regard we would like to pledge oursupport to the ongoing efforts in the United Nations toaddress this critical issue that threatens the economicand social fabric of our society.My Government strongly condemns all acts ofterrorism committed by whomever  wherever and forwhatever purposes. With the growing interdependencein the world  terrorism constitutes a grave danger forrich  poor  large and small countries alike. We wouldhowever like to bring to mind that the fight againstterrorism should  at all times  take place in accordancewith international law and with respect for humanrights  tolerance and the peaceful coexistence ofpeople.The fight against terrorism must address its rootcauses. Suriname  being a multi-ethnic  multireligiousand multicultural society  believes that increasedtolerance and dialogue could make a positivecontribution to the goal of increased security.We therefore continue to support the dialogueamong civilizations and remain convinced that aculture of peace can be significantly enhanced throughthis dialogue in order to promote mutualunderstanding  respect and tolerance among regions cultures and peoples.Respect for human rights and fundamentalfreedoms remains of great importance to theGovernment of Suriname. The creation of a HumanRights Council  as was agreed to in the outcomedocument  should not only result in a renaming of theCommission on Human Rights; we have the dauntingtask ahead of us of restoring credibility to the humanrights machinery by addressing the shortfalls of theCommission on Human Rights and ensuring that theHuman Rights Council becomes a more effective andobjective organ.The United Nations should resolve to come to therescue of people confronted with genocide  ethnic29cleansing and crimes against humanity. We mustcontinue to discuss the framework to be associatedwith this difficult task. But more importantly  theUnited Nations  through its Charter provisions  shouldfind ways and means geared towards preventing theseatrocities from reoccurring.The international community has some time agoexpressed the need for a more effective and efficientOrganization that would be better able to address themany challenges our world is facing today and make itmore responsive to the aspirations of the world’speople. Suriname continues to believe in the values ofthe United Nations as the supreme multilateralinstitution and supports the efforts of strengthening theOrganization through reform.More than ever  good intentions must give rise toconcrete achievements. We must translatecommitments into action. We owe it to the manypeople living in extreme poverty who do not haveaccess to safe drinking water and do not have properhealth care.Achieving such a global society requires theinvolvement  determination and commitment of allactors — State and non-State — as well as coordinatedand comprehensive actions by all such actors in theglobal fight against poverty and injustice.Our shared objectives require more than areaffirmation of the importance of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and the availability of financialresources. It requires understanding between developedand developing countries. It requires political will which is a condition sine qua non in our efforts toachieve our global commitments.I am convinced that the recently concluded high-level gathering of world leaders generated the renewedpolitical commitment to further the cause of globalpartnership between the developing and developedcountries to promote development and continue thefight against poverty and hunger.In conclusion  let me remark that we have to actnow. We cannot build a world of peace and securitywithout economic and social development and withoutrespect for human rights."
"153",6481,"SVK",60,2005,"At the outset  allow me tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its sixtiethsession. I am confident that your experience inmultilateral diplomacy  coupled with a positiveapproach  will serve as a guarantee of success for theoutcome of your decisions. Ahead of us lie demandingtasks related to the implementation of the reformdecisions that have been adopted. I wish to assure thatyou can fully rely on Slovakia's support in that regard.I wish also to convey our solidarity to the UnitedStates citizens devastated by Hurricane Katrina  whoare struggling to recover from the trauma of losingtheir loved ones and their homes. On behalf of thepeople and the Government of Slovakia  I extendheartfelt sympathy to the families of the victims whoperished in that natural disaster.We are gathered here in this forum because thechallenges faced by humankind in the area of globaldevelopment  security and protection of human rightsbring us together in our search for common solutionsthat call for clear political decisions. There is a generalunderstanding that the United Nations  in its currentshape and form  is not up to the challenges that lieahead of it in the twenty-first century. Accordingly  wemust follow through with the necessary changes so thatthis Organization may continue to fulfil its roleefficiently while keeping abreast of the growing needsand expectations of the international community.The Secretary-General has submitted his plan which contains a package of bold reform steps layingdown ways for the international community to dealwith current issues and upgrade the United Nationssystem. Since the very day on which it was published Slovakia has believed that his plan provides anexcellent basis for our deliberations. We endorse thepremise that progress in tackling the most importantglobal problems can only be achieved if the issues ofdevelopment  security and human rights are addressedjointly. In particular  we welcome the fact that humanrights are accorded the same priority as developmentand security  and we appreciate the relevant proposalsto strengthen the international system for the protectionof human rights.The reform of the United Nations is not a matterto be dealt with by the Organization alone  asresponsibility for reaching concrete consensus on keyissues lies primarily in the hands of the Governmentsof Member States. Reaching agreement thataccommodates the interests of the entire world is noeasy task. This yearís summit and its outcomedocument have forced us to look in the mirror. Theyhave shown us the amount of vision  wisdom andcourage that we were able and willing to bring to thistask  with a view to fundamentally reforming thesystem of multilateral cooperation in the interest ofglobal development. The image we saw reflected in themirror was not to everyoneís liking  but that is thenature of multilateral diplomacy. It is the result ofcompromise  the art of the possible  which is both itsstrong and its weak point. In that connection  I prefertaking a forward-looking approach with regard to theoutcome document  which contains messages and ideasthat deserve our support in the General Assembly. Letus try to go ahead with its implementation as best wecan.22Despite the considerable progress achieved -primarily in the fight against poverty and famine inAsia - all reports draw attention to  the extremelyalarming and unacceptable downturn in several parts ofAfrica. Slovakia came to the summit with theunderstanding that our first priority was to makeprogress in achieving the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs). In my view  the outcome documentprovides a solid basis for our future work in thatregard.Slovakia has not been inactive in that respect.The amount of public funds appropriated for foreignaid has quadrupled since the year 2000  which speaksfor itself. In addition  having joined the EuropeanUnion in May 2004  Slovakia also joined the commonEuropean development aid system. As a new memberof the Union  Slovakia pledged to do its utmost toincrease its official development assistance to 0.17 percent of gross domestic product by 2010  and to 0.33per cent by 2015.Slovakia is directly funding and implementingmore than 70 projects in the poor countries of Europe Asia and Africa. That gives us the opportunity todirectly pass on to developing countries the uniqueknowledge that we acquired during our own countryístransition.In addition to favouring an increase in aid Slovakia also supports further reform of trade relationsas well as debt relief for poor countries. I wish tohighlight the serious debt relief measures that Slovakiatook earlier this year  forgiving several hundred milliondollars in debt owed by heavily indebted poorcountries.Slovakia welcomes efforts aimed at liberalizingtrade as a means to promote economic growth anddevelopment. We therefore join the call for anexpeditious completion of the World TradeOrganizationís Doha round of negotiations.At this point  I must mention that one of the mostserious global threats is the escalation of terrorism. It iscommendable that the outcome document clearlydenounces this new plague of our time  whichendangers the population of rich and poor countriesalike. Slovakia has clearly opposed all forms ofviolence and expressions of blind fanaticism andhatred. During the summit  in order to demonstrateSlovakiaís position  I personally signed theInternational Convention for the Suppression of Actsof Nuclear Terrorism  which is the latest in a series ofanti-terrorist international treaty instruments. Slovakiais also a signatory to all 12 United Nations anti-terrorism conventions. Slovakia strongly supports thecomprehensive strategy to fight terrorism presented bySecretary-General Kofi Annan at the MadridConference in March 2005.I must say that Slovakia had expected that thesummit would have formulated a clear definition ofterrorism  which is an important prerequisite for theadoption of a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention.While we did not achieve that  it is neverthelessimperative that we redouble our efforts to draft such aconvention in order that it can still be adopted duringthis sixtieth session. The outcome document will serveas a good starting point for that effort.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructioncontinues to represent the most serious threat to globalsecurity. It is therefore regrettable that the outcomedocument leaves us with more questions than answers.As a member of the Board of Governors of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  Slovakiarecognizes the right to the peaceful use of nuclearenergy without the possibility of misusing thattechnology to produce nuclear arms. We thereforebelieve that in order to prevent the proliferation ofnuclear weapons it is crucial to strengthen thesupervisory competencies of the IAEA and to controlmore effectively the stages in the nuclear fuel cyclethat involve uranium enrichment and plutoniumprocessing. However  such restrictions must takeaccount of the right of countries that fully satisfy theirtreaty obligations to obtain energy from nuclear power.Slovakia supported the proposal to set up aHuman Rights Council as a permanent principal bodyof the United Nations. The Human Rights Councilshould follow up on all the positive and constructivefeatures of the existing Human Rights Commission.Members of the Human Rights Council should beelected by a two-thirds majority of the GeneralAssembly. The Slovak Republic is in favour of theCouncil being composed of a small number ofmembers in order to give it the necessary flexibility inresponding to emerging problems. Slovakia supportedthe proposal to elect members of the Council on aregional basis  and from countries that demonstrablymeet their commitments concerning the protection ofhuman rights. Slovakia also encourages closer23interactions between the Office of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights  the Human RightsCouncil and the Security Council. In that context  wewelcome the proposal in the summitís outcomedocument to strengthen the Office of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights.We were also pleased to note that  for the firsttime  the outcome document contains a broaderdefinition of the principle of the responsibility toprotect. Slovakia looks forward to further work in thatregard. We believe that after Cambodia  Rwanda  theSudan and Srebrenica  we are slowly entering a stagewhere we take on more direct responsibility for dealingwith situations where genocide and war crimes arecommitted. The principle of sovereignty means thatresponsibility for people lies with each sovereigncountry and its Government. However  if a particularGovernment fails to live up to that responsibility  theinternational community has the obligation to take allnecessary steps and use all available and necessarymeans to prevent a major humanitarian disaster.Slovakia was very much in favour of the proposalto set up a Peacebuilding Commission. Experienceshows us that we must not rush to leave a country thathas just seen the end of a conflict and simply turn ourbacks on the whole situation. Our recent history hasprovided us several bad examples in that regard. Wemust strengthen our efforts with a view to setting up aneffective Peacebuilding Commission in the shortestamount of time possible. The outcome document setsout clear parameters and a timeframe for itsestablishment.I mentioned at the outset that it is essential torealign the United Nations with the reality of ourmodern era. In that regard  it is essential to furtherrevitalize the General Assembly. We must also reformthe Economic and Social Council so as to make itcapable of effectively implementing the developmentagenda of the United Nations.With respect to reorganizing the Secretariat  weare in favour of increasing the flexibility  andstrengthening the authority of  the Secretary-General inhis managerial functions as the head of theOrganization  in order to enable him to keep abreast ofthe current needs of the United Nations. He must begiven the necessary resources to perform his role. Atthe same time  it will be necessary to strengthen theindependence and powers of internal supervisorybodies in order to ensure more transparency andaccountability inside the Organization. Of course  allthe reforms will require appropriate funding in ordernot to dissipate the efforts that were necessary to reachconsensus.Among the reforms that have enjoyed Slovakia'slong-standing support is the reform of the SecurityCouncil. This is an issue on which  despite ongoingefforts  we were unable to reach a balanced agreement.We need a more democratic and more representativeSecurity Council that better reflects todayís newgeopolitical situation. The Security Council should beenlarged in both categories of membership by addingcountries that play an important role in the global arenaand in the United Nations framework. It is vital that anenlarged Council retain its effectiveness with regard todecision-making.We intend to actively support the transitionprocess in Iraq with a view to creating a secure  stable united  prosperous and democratic country  inaccordance with Security Council resolutions. As wedeclared at the International Conference on Iraq  heldon 22 June 2005 in Brussels  Slovakia has decided toforgive $1.13 billion of Iraq's debt as a tangiblecontribution to that end. We are confident that the Iraqipeople will use the October referendum to show theirsupport for the new Constitution  and that democraticparliamentary elections will follow.Stabilizing the western Balkans remains a priorityon my countryís foreign policy agenda. Slovakia hasthus far supported the engagement of the UnitedNations in the region by participating in peacekeepingand stabilization missions in the Balkans. In ouropinion  the pivotal issue with regard to thestabilization of the Western Balkans is the future statusof Kosovo  which remains a potential element ofinstability in the region. We denounce all acts ofviolence and intolerance inside the province. Webelieve that the majority of Kosovars aspire to peace democracy and development. In particular  weappreciate the activities of the Special Envoy of theSecretary-General  Kai Eide.Slovakia has been approved as the candidate ofthe Group of Eastern European States for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council in the electionsto be held at this session of the General Assembly.Slovakia has never been a member of the SecurityCouncil  although it has taken an active part in United24Nations peacekeeping efforts through its participationin operations in Europe  Asia  Africa and the MiddleEast.If elected to membership in that important body the Slovak Republic will enter the Security Council ata dynamic moment characterized by a changing globalenvironment and by the search for a new securityconsensus. New threats to security represent growingchallenges to the ability of the international system tomaintain international peace and security. Thatdevelopment will therefore also be a challenge for ourcountry in its capacity as a member of the SecurityCouncil  in particular because it will test our readinessto shoulder greater commitment and responsibility forstability and security around the world. I want to assurethe Assembly that Slovakia is ready to take on thisimportant assignment with honour and responsibility."
"154",6506,"SVN",60,2005,"Allow me atthe outset to congratulate you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its sixtiethsession. I would like to express to you the full supportof the Republic of Slovenia as you carry out thatextremely important and responsible task. May youhave much vision  courage and resolve as you presideover the General Assembly during this anniversary year.Mr. Sardenberg (Brazil)  Vice-President  took theChair.At the same time  Sir  I would like to express oursincere recognition and gratitude for the efforts of yourpredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  President at the fifty-ninthsession of the General Assembly. His determinedleadership  his insight into the current issues of themodern world and his enduring courage enabled him toguide the General Assembly in its sixtieth year  whichpromises to be a year of the greatest significance forthe future of the Organization.We have assembled here to consider together ingood faith how we should respond to the challenges ofmodern times and how our Organization should beadapted to the needs of the twenty-first century. We arehere to act on the basis of our best understanding andour belief in the achievements of creative developmentfor the well-being of the people of the modern world to quote  Sir  your illustrious compatriot  DagHammarskjöld.The outcome document contains numerousmeaningful and useful ideas. That document’s purposeis to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nationsand consolidate its mission in the modern world. Thereform of the Organization is of the utmost importanceand was initiated at the right moment. This is a time ofchange for several international organizations andinstitutions. All are certainly aware of the currenttransformation of the European Union and theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Such changes are difficult. We encounter obstaclessuch as the rejection of the European ConstitutionalTreaty in two referendums.The effectiveness of the machinery and themission of the United Nations should also be improvedthrough the creation of the Human Rights Council andthe fight against terrorism. There were manydiscussions and diverging views on those two questionsin relation to the outcome document. However  wecannot be successful if we have difficulty evendefining terrorism or establishing the Human RightsCouncil. There is some indecisiveness in the outcomedocument in that respect. With respect to terrorism  thedocument speaks of dialogue and understanding amongcivilizations. With respect to the Human RightsCouncil  the outcome document proposes holdingfurther negotiations to establish  among other things its mandate and working methods.In today’s world  change and certainty are closelyconnected and interdependent. Attaining a balancebetween them involves values  rules  laws and theinstitutions of human dignity  equality and democracy —in short  human rights.The fact is  we live in a globalized andinterdependent world in which we all are responsiblefor our security. It is significant that the outcomedocument warns that there can be no developmentwithout security and no security without development and that both development and security depend to a32great degree on respect for human rights  the rule oflaw and democracy.Many efforts have been made to address thesources of suffering in the world. United NationsMember States must continue to support efforts toattain the Millennium Development Goals. Twenty-fiveEuropean Union (EU) member States committedthemselves to the target of allocating 0.7 per cent oftheir gross domestic product (GDP) to officialdevelopment assistance by 2015. In that context Slovenia  one of the 10 new EU members and a newdonor  committed itself to attaining the target of 0.33per cent of GDP for development aid. We underline theneed for the long-term commitment and responsibilityof all countries in order to attain the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.We are continuously surprised at the changingnature of the threats facing each and every country.The concept of security includes both State securityand the security of the individual. Thus  it is importantto effectively address various issues  in particulardisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction  as well as the problem of theproliferation of illegal small arms and light weapons which affects numerous countries. We are ratherdisappointed that the outcome document does notinclude provisions on non-proliferation anddisarmament  and we hope that work on those issueswill continue after the summit.Terrorist attacks on innocent peoplefundamentally contradict the value systems of moderncountries  in particular human rights  as formulated andstated in international conventions and declarations.Terrorist attacks are a violation of human rights  whichare the foundation of modern societies; they representan assault on the very essence of those societies andthus negate their very modernity. This negation isconnected with the complex and paradoxical nature ofthe concept of modernity. It seems that the fundamentalfrustration caused by this complex and paradoxicalnature drives terrorists to commit radical actions.Terrorism cannot tolerate the complex and paradoxicalcharacter of modern societies.Measures in the fight against terrorism are aimedat those whose actions deny and reject human rights asa fundamental value of modern societies. Byexamining terrorists’ attitudes and the meaning ofterrorism  we should be able to define terrorism. Anagreed definition of terrorism would provide clarityand help better ensure human rights. The more fullyhuman rights are protected  the more successful wewill be in our fight against terrorism. Human rightswill be more fully protected when terrorism is withoutprotection. Tolerating or justifying terrorismundermines human rights.That does not mean  however  that we can fail torespect human rights in waging our fight againstterrorism. It is precisely universal respect for humanrights and fundamental freedoms  including in the fightagainst terrorism  that will ensure the success of thatfight and preserve the democratic and free principles ofthose societies which are being targeted by terrorists.Slovenia welcomes the affirmation of theprinciple of the responsibility to protect. By endorsingthat principle  world leaders have made a conceptualbreakthrough in the prevention of future tragedies likethose of Srebrenica  Rwanda and Darfur. For the firsttime  we have recognized our national and collectiveresponsibility to act in cases of genocide and ethniccleansing  war crimes and crimes against humanity.Slovenia considers the responsibility to protect to be anintegral part of national responsibility to protect acountry’s people against atrocities. It is ourunderstanding that the Security Council shares theresponsibility to protect and that the use of the veto inthe Council is fundamentally incompatible with thatresponsibility.We welcome the establishment of a DemocracyFund and intend to contribute to it. We strongly supporta strengthened role for the Office of the HighCommissioner for Human Rights. The strengthenedrole of the Office  to be financed from the UnitedNations regular budget  is good news for the realizationof human rights on the ground.The level of agreement on the Human RightsCouncil is a disappointment. Numerous countrieswanted and expected more. Unfortunately  for themoment  we are left without the necessary vision of anew Council  even though  in the preparations for thesummit  we formulated good proposals for theCouncil’s structure and mandate.Slovenia wants a standing Council that is aprincipal organ of the United Nations  able to deal withall human rights concerns in all countries at all times.We want a Council that better addresses rights andfreedoms  without double standards. We want a33Council that could convene and act in every instance ofmassive violation of human rights. We want a Councilable to make recommendations to other organs andagencies of the United Nations system so that humanrights are truly integrated in all areas of theOrganization. Finally  we want a Council that reflectsthe diversity of the modern world and that gives aproper voice to civil society through non-governmentalorganizations. In the course of the sixtieth session ofthe General Assembly  Slovenia will continue toactively support the establishment of a strong andefficient new Human Rights Council.I have already mentioned the dialogue ofcivilizations. That dialogue should be based onuniversal  fundamental values. No differentiationbetween “us” and “them” should be tolerated. Humanrights and fundamental freedoms are the manifestationof our common fundamental values. They are the bestanswer for ensuring a dignified life in our globalized fast-paced and increasingly unsafe world. On the basisof our wealth of traditions and history and creativediversity  all individuals should be informed of and beable to realize their rights and freedoms  as this is thebest long-term foundation for peace and development.Educating people about human rights and dignity is aprerequisite for this goal  and we are thrilled to see thatthe need for such education is properly reflected in theoutcome document. As a member State of the HumanSecurity Network we are pleased that the issue ofhuman security has been included in the outcomedocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting and willcontinue to be discussed in the General Assembly.Cooperation between the United Nations andregional organizations deserves our priority attention infuture. As experiences from a variety of geographicenvironments and conditions have shown — inparticular in South-Eastern Europe and Africa —synergetic cooperation between the United Nations andregional organizations can be very effective.As Chairman-in-Office of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  I call forthe elaboration of a binding framework for permanentcooperation between the United Nations and thatimportant regional organization as soon as possible.For 30 years now  OSCE has proved effective in verysensitive regions of the world. This year marks thethirtieth anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act  whichestablished OSCE. Thirty years ago  the integration ofEast and West began. Today  our main duty is tointegrate civilizations. One of the areas that should befurther developed is strengthening dialogue amongcivilizations. It may be that the supreme importance ofour outcome document rests on that dialogue."
"155",6551,"SWE",60,2005,"A small boy on the runremains vividly in my mind today  a boy with eyes thathave seen more horror than most of us in this Hall haveever seen  a boy whom all of us have failed.There are thousands of children like him inDarfur. I met him when I visited areas of fear suffering  hunger and senseless violence. We owe thatboy in Darfur more: better performance; a strongerconnection between our declarations and our actions.We have tools to prevent armed conflicts. Wehave made many commitments to end oppression radically reduce poverty and protect our environment.We have cures for many of the diseases that continue tokill. The challenge before us is to use instruments forpeace  development and human rights  and to transformour commitments into real action.Cooperation across borders is not just a goodidea - it is a must. And for the truly globalchallenges  the United Nations is indispensable. Ourjoint commitment to the Charter of the United Nationsis an excellent starting point But as new threats emergeand the world evolves  the United Nations must alsoadapt.We need a multilateralism that is effective  withinstitutions that have teeth and a strong political will tomake them work. We need a multilateralism that isbased on common principles  not on the lowestcommon denominator of the day. We need a rule-basedinternational order  applicable to all.This is a crucial year for the United Nations. TheSecretary-General has  with great courage and vision led the way. The outcome of the summit sets thedirection. This session of the General Assembly hasbeen given the responsibility of following up onimportant decisions. We must together achieve realresults in a number of areas. Let me highlight some ofthe main challenges.The first challenge is to make progress on theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Millions ofpeople still suffer from extreme poverty. Importantprogress has been made towards the goal of eradicatingpoverty  but we need to do better. All developedcountries should make timetables for reaching thetarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national income forinternational development assistance by the year 2015.Sweden will reach its one per cent target next year.Equally important is that all countries live up to thecommitments on aid effectiveness  to our agreementsfrom Monterrey and to our promises to find new waysof financing development.Better progress in preventing maternal and childmortality is vital for reaching many of the MDGs. Wemust renew our commitment of universal access toreproductive health care by 2015 and give more focusto sexual and reproductive health care and rights.Market access for goods and services must besubstantially improved for poor countries. Trade-distorting subsidies need to be phased out. Sweden willcontinue to work for reduced agricultural subsidies andto press for speedy implementation of the developmentdimension of the Doha work programme.While the developed world can and should play abigger part in order to reach the MDGs  the developingcountries bear the critical responsibility for their owndevelopment. The importance for the sustainability ofdevelopment efforts of good governance  well-39functioning democratic institutions and full respect forhuman rights and the rule of law cannot beunderestimated.The second challenge is to halt climate change.Awareness of the connection between the way we liveour lives  particularly in the industrialized world  andits effects on the long-term survival of our planet istoday greater than ever. But action is still much toolimited. It is deeply regrettable that no firm agreementon the way forward was reached at the summit. Allparties to the Kyoto Protocol and to the United NationsClimate Change Convention must continue toimplement their commitments. There is also a need tourgently initiate a process aimed at controlling climatechange beyond the year 2012.The third challenge is to combat terrorismtogether. Terrorism has taken the lives of thousands ofinnocent people. One of our most urgent priorities mustbe to stop and prevent terrorism. It remains a threat toall of us. We need to address these threats together with a broad strategy  and with respect for humanrights. The outcome of the summit has given us aplatform to build on. The United Nations should nowtake the lead in developing a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy based on the Secretary-Generalísexcellent work. We must also conclude acomprehensive convention on international terrorism including a legal definition  during the sixtieth sessionof the General Assembly.The fourth challenge is to better promote humanrights. Human rights are violated throughout the world creating enormous suffering and affecting both securityand development. Human rights must be mainstreamedin all United Nations work as a core task of theOrganization. Sweden welcomes the decision to createa Human Rights Council. That Council will need astrong mandate to address any human rights situation respond to urgent human rights violations and monitorcompliance by all States with their human rightsobligations. We must all join in efforts to establish aneffective and legitimate Human Rights Council duringthe sixtieth session.The summit made a strong commitment to ourcommon responsibility to protect. We must now actaccordingly. The world has a responsibility to react inorder to prevent genocide  ethnic cleansing and crimesagainst humanity. The Security Council must be readyto take responsibility if and when a State cannot giveits citizens the necessary protection. However  it is notjust a question of acknowledging the obligation to act;it is also a question of being prepared to actually do so.The fifth challenge is to implement commitmentson disarmament and non-proliferation. Weapons ofmass destruction could kill all of us here  all at once.They could wipe out villages  cities and entirepopulations in seconds. Yet we still do not take thethreat seriously enough. It should have been made clearat the summit that disarmament commitments are to beimplemented and that non-proliferation undertakingsare to be complied with. The countries in possession ofnuclear weapons have a special responsibility todisarm. At the summit  decisions should have beentaken to strengthen verification. There should havebeen commitments to make the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and otherarms conventions universal. Negotiation processesshould have been given a boost by the summit. None ofthat actually happened.Sweden looks forward to the recommendations ofthe Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission  chairedby Mr. Hans Blix. The failure to address the threatposed by weapons of mass destruction leaves us withan immensely important task ahead.The sixth challenge is to put the PeacebuildingCommission in place promptly. Far too many people inwar-torn countries have seen a fragile peace relapseinto new conflict. With the establishment of thePeacebuilding Commission  the United Nations isbetter equipped to build peace in war-torn societies andto prevent countries from relapsing into war. In orderto be successful  the Commission needs to draw onlessons from international peace efforts. Regionalorganizations will have important contributions tomake. The Peacebuilding Commission needs a well-balanced composition  including major donorcountries. Let us establish this Commission before theend of the year. Sweden is ready to do its part including through the swift provision of financialcontributions.The seventh challenge is to reform the SecurityCouncil and the Secretariat. United Nations reform willnot be complete without Security Council reform. Ifthe decisions of the Council are to be accepted aslegitimate and effectively implemented  the Councilneeds to better represent the world of today. Inaddition  the Councilís effectiveness must be40safeguarded. There should be no extension of the rightof veto  and the use of the veto should be limited. Thereform of the United Nations also requires the reformof the Secretariat. The summit took several importantdecisions on management reform. Those include areview of internal rules  regulations and mandates andthe strengthening of the oversight system. But greaterflexibility must be given to the Secretary-General inmanaging staff and resources. That would not onlymake the Secretariat more efficient  but it would alsoenable Member States to focus more on strategic issuesand make the Organization more dynamic.The summit has provided essential momentum formore effective multilateralism. The legacy of ourefforts will continue to be determined during thesixtieth session of the General Assembly. During themonths ahead the task can be completed - the task tocreate a United Nations capable of facing thechallenges of our time.In conclusion  let me return to the subject withwhich I began: Darfur. The United Nations must  aboveall  serve the interests of the boy that I met there and ofall the other children  as well as the husbands  thewives  the grandparents - men and women of thisworld who lack security  hope and human dignity. Thatis our mission."
"156",6589,"SWZ",60,2005,"It is an honour andprivilege for me to present my country’s statement  ascommanded by His Majesty King Mswati III.I am happy to convey the greetings and bestwishes of His Majesty King Mswati III  Her Majestythe Queen Mother  and the entire Swazi nation.On behalf of my delegation  I wish tocongratulate Mr. Eliasson on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. TheKingdom of Swaziland is confident that his diplomaticskills and vast experience in international affairs willguide the work of the General Assembly to asuccessful conclusion as it faces the daunting task ofreform and change.We wish also to recognize the work done by hispredecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  Minister of Foreign Affairs23of Gabon  who ably steered the last session so as to setthe stage for change in the year 2005. He hands overthe leadership of this body at a crucial time — a timewhen we have to take concrete and firm action to effectsuch change. We wish him well and every success inhis future endeavours.This is a momentous occasion  as we arecelebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the UnitedNations at a time when we are charting a course andadopting clear guidelines for adapting the Organizationto the effective role it must play in the new century. Wehave also taken on the responsibility and challenge ofensuring that the United Nations of the twenty-firstcentury can make real improvements in the lives of thepeoples of the world.Given the contributions of the United Nations toworld peace  economic and social development and theobservance of human rights  we are reaffirming ourfaith in the Organization  and we will continue to workto achieve the objectives of the Charter through thestrengthening and revitalization of the United Nationssystem.In the last five years  the international communityhas witnessed a mixed bag of successes  trials andtribulations whose consequences have been felt acrossthe globe. The scale of some of these man-madeproblems and natural disasters — such as terrorism war  the tsunami and Hurricane Katrina — wasunprecedented.It is because of some of these incidents that  forthe first time in its existence  the United Nations hasbeen challenged in its pivotal role of maintainingglobal peace  security and safety. Fortunately  theUnited Nations has remained undeterred  and that isdue in particular to the astute leadership of ourSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  whose diplomaticskills and efforts to unite — tested as they havebeen — have managed to keep the Organizationfocused as it deals with the critical issues confrontingthe international community today.For those reasons  the Kingdom of Swazilandbelieves that this session presents an opportunity for usto advance further the reform process in order not onlyto make the Organization efficient and effective  butalso to ensure that the programmes of action adopted atpast global conferences are fully implemented.We therefore welcome the decisions taken at therecently concluded Millennium Development Goals(MDGs) review summit. These will indeed set us oncourse to have a significant impact on each and everycountry’s socio-political and economic development.Our quest for a safer and secure world continuesto be challenged. The recent spate of terroristbombings in various parts of the world is a clearindication that we have to fight that growing scourgewith urgency. The adoption of the 13 conventionscovering different aspects of terrorism demonstratesour unwavering commitment to this course.The Kingdom of Swaziland supports theSecretary-General’s call for the drafting of acomprehensive instrument that will enable us tocollectively and effectively fight terrorism.Tensions and conflicts within and among States which are detrimental to development and productivity continue to affect many parts of the world. Suchconflicts are fuelled by the ever-growing illicit trade insmall arms and light weapons  which cause the deathand displacement of thousands of innocent peopleevery year.In that regard  the Kingdom of Swazilandsupports United Nations efforts to enhanceinternational cooperation to prevent  combat anderadicate the illicit trade in small arms and lightweapons. We further call for stern action to be takenagainst the mass production of such arms and weapons in the same manner as we would deal with drugproducers.In this age of globalization  collective action willbe necessary given that no single nation can find itsown solutions to the challenges that we face. In thatcontext  we welcome the various initiatives currentlyunder way that are aimed at engaging regionalorganizations to do their part in responding tochallenges within their regions.These partnerships have been taking shape  and itis now up to us to give them substance by establishingappropriate frameworks  harmonizing methods andpooling capacities and resources for our work.We in Africa consider cooperation between theAfrican Union and the United Nations as being of greatvalue. For example  peacekeeping and peacebuildingmissions continue to enhance peace initiatives in ourregion. However  I would like to stress here that24peacekeeping operations must go hand in hand withhumanitarian efforts  with all of the urgency suchsituations require.African leaders have demonstrated their politicalwill  but they lack the resources to resolve crises inAfrica. It is for that reason that we appeal to theinternational community to increase its support for theAfrican Union  so as to enhance its capacity andresponse mechanism.The Kingdom of Swaziland supports the call foran integrated approach to conflict resolution on ourcontinent  and we also support the idea that the AfricanUnion is the organ best suited to mobilizing the effortsof its members  and  most important of all  toundertaking preventive action before a situationdeteriorates.The Kingdom of Swaziland remains concerned however  by the conflict in the Middle East  whichcontinues to threaten international peace and security.We believe that the road map holds the key to apositive outcome on the matter and urge the Quartet tocontinue its efforts to bridge the differences betweenthe parties.While welcoming the positive efforts by theGovernment of Israel to withdraw from some parts ofthe occupied territories  we would urge both parties tomake a commitment to a comprehensive cessation ofall violence  particularly that aimed at civilians  or elsereal progress will remain elusive. We remain hopefulthat a solution to the conflict is imminent and continueto urge both parties to remain pragmatic andconstructive in their quest for a solution.The recent MDG follow-up summit succeeded inhighlighting the plight of Africa with unprecedentedclarity. The paradox of Africa is the extreme andincreasing poverty of its people  who face manyproblems  including ill health  in a land so richlyendowed with natural resources. This has becomeincreasingly visible over the past decade  while wehave seen evidence of a decline in poverty in otherparts of the world.In much of Africa  one of the major causes andconsequences of poverty is disease  mainly malaria andHIV/AIDS. These diseases continue to compromise thehealth situation in African countries  halting and evenreversing health gains achieved in earlier years. Thepoor are caught in a complex poverty trap in which lowincome leads to low consumption  which in turn resultsin low capacity and low productivity.The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that thereare relatively affordable technologies in our modernworld that can mitigate the effect of disease on thepoor. Experience has shown that proven strategies andhealth interventions can effectively and dramaticallyreduce the toll of these killer diseases. Fortunately  theMDGs point the way forward.We believe that the creation of a world solidarityfund to eradicate extreme poverty and an accord withinthe framework of the World Trade Organization onpatents are imperative and would be steps in the rightdirection  so that our countries can provide medicinesto all.Health is a strong entry point for povertyreduction  and alleviating the disease burden on thepoor will contribute to the improvement of their socialstatus.This year also marks another milestone in thecalendar of the movement for gender equality and theadvancement of women: the 10-year review of theBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action. In 1995women gathered in Beijing and took a giant stepforward. At that point  gender equality came to berecognized as a critical element of development andpeace for each and every country. Some progress hasbeen made. For example  many more girls are nowenrolled in primary education. Investing in women isparamount for ensuring sustainable development.During this session  we must strive to meet thechallenge that the Charter  established 60 years ago articulated: the equal rights of men and women.As we note this progress  we acknowledge thenewer challenges that have emerged  such as the effectsof the HIV/AIDS pandemic on both women and girls.The HIV/AIDS scourge continues to plague ourcommunities in Africa. The pandemic is as much amedical crisis as it is an economic  social and politicalcrisis. With no cure insight  it will continue to depletethe essential financial and human resources so criticalfor development. For its part  my Government has beencollaborating with local communities to find home-grown solutions to this problem. We continue to begrateful to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria and other internationalagencies for the assistance and support they continue toprovide us in our fight against this killer disease.25There is no doubt that developing countries aredetermined to fight poverty by creating jobs for ourpeople. As we play our part in the mobilization ofdomestic resources  I would like to appeal to thedeveloped world to meet its commitments bysupporting us. Effective assistance by the internationalcommunity to enhance the quality of economic choicesis necessary  as is firm commitment withoutconditionalities.The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that theDoha Development Agenda needs to be seriouslyadvanced  with industrialized countries addressing theneeds of developing countries. We call for better accessto markets  in particular preferential markets withlowered tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade withindustrialized countries.On the question of reform of the United Nations the Kingdom of Swaziland supports the wide range ofproposals put forward to revitalize our Organization inits management of our affairs. We are of the view thatthe role of the General Assembly must be significantlystrengthened to enable it to fulfil the tasks originallyassigned to it by the Charter. The General Assembly  asthe most democratic and representative body of theUnited Nations  should seize this opportunity to takethe lead and thus demonstrate that it can express thepolitical will of the people of the world.In this regard  the Economic and Social Counciltoo should be strengthened and given decision-makingpowers to implement the United Nations developmentagenda. We also believe that the Council shouldcontinue to be the overall coordinator of alldevelopment activities  including the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.As we discuss greater representation and widerparticipation in the United Nations system  and as wecelebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization allow me to remind all of us gathered here that themore than 23 million people of the Republic of Chinaremain hopeful that their voice in quest of participationin the very important United Nations system will soonbe heard and positively responded to  so that they toocan make their valuable contributions to themanagement and prosperity of world affairs. In themeantime  it is our continued hope that the existingissues between the parties will be resolved peacefully."
"157",6664,"SYR",60,2005,"It is my pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its sixtieth session. Your renownedexperience in international affairs  especially in theUnited Nations system  will undoubtedly guaranteesuccess for our deliberations. I cannot fail to seize thisopportunity to express to your predecessor  Mr. JeanPing  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon  our thanksand appreciation for his efforts towards the successfulconduct of the deliberations of the fifty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly. It also gives me pleasure toexpress to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Kofi Annan  our appreciation for his efforts toimplement the resolutions of the Organization and tofulfil the purposes of its Charter.During the 60 years of its existence  the UnitedNations has witnessed heated debates and bitterdifferences. Yet this Organization remains a forum fordialogue among nations on the means of building asecure world. While we agree with others on the needto reform the United Nations and take newinternational developments into account  we stress thatsuch a process should be constructive and should applylessons learned and the positive experiences that theUnited Nations has had. We also believe that such aprocess should unite and not divide us. It is throughbroad agreement that we will be able to enhance theauthority and legitimacy of the United Nations  as wellas its ability to effectively respond to the challenges ofthe twenty-first century.We must not forget that this Organization belongsto us all  and not merely to one particular party. Weshould therefore find the wisdom to preserve it forfuture generations.Five years ago  we adopted a declaration in whichwe set out the international communityís vision for thenew millennium. Regrettably  both facts and figuresshow that the results have not lived up to ourexpectations. The objectives defined remainunfulfilled. Poverty  hunger and epidemics areprevalent throughout the world  while tension andforeign occupation continue to threaten internationalpeace and security and hamper development for thoseliving under foreign occupation. Failure to eliminateweapons of mass destruction  foremost among whichare nuclear weapons  haunts us and threatens peace. Itis no longer feasible to delay the reform of the worldeconomic order. Moreover  reform should not beconfined to this international Organization. Rather  itmust encompass all international economic andfinancial institutions  particularly those that contributeto economic decision-making. The road ahead lies in20fairness  equality and democratic participation. TheBretton Woods institutions  whose decisions beardirectly on life in our countries  should be the primecandidates for the overdue reform. We deem it fit torecall the recommendation of several summit meetings in both the North and the South  supporting thedeveloping countriesí right to join the World TradeOrganization  with no hurdles and in a depoliticizedway.Speaking of development  we welcome theimportant outcomes of the three summits held duringthe past five months on development  namely  theAsian-African Summit  the South American-ArabCountries Summit  and the second South-SouthSummit. Those meetings rejected the imposition ofunilateral sanctions  considering such a policy to be inviolation of the principles of the Charter andinternational law and dangerous to development plansand reform processes in the targeted countries.The main focus of discussions in the High-levelPlenary Meeting was the reform of the United Nations.We believe that the reform process will not becomplete if it does not take into consideration theinability of the United Nations  for reasons known toall  to implement its resolutions pertaining to the Arab-Israeli conflict. These reasons are primarily embodiedin the generous support and unlimited protectionoffered by some to Israeli aggression against the Arabstates and to Israelís continuing occupation of theSyrian Golan  the Palestinian territories  and parts ofsouthern Lebanon.Syria has declared that the withdrawal of settlersand Israeli forces from Gaza is undoubtedly a first stepbut that this alone is not enough for peace. What isrequired is the implementation of all United Nationsresolutions  the establishment of an independentPalestinian State  the return of the occupied GolanHeights and the return of refugees. There are relentlessattempts by the Israeli side in particular and also bythose who support it to portray this withdrawal as agreat accomplishment that is also painful. However they are neglecting the fact that the painful Israelioccupation of the Gaza Strip lasted for over 38 years during which our brothers in the Gaza Strip inparticular suffered from the horrors of occupation andits inhumane practices.Moreover  this abominable occupation persists inthe West Bank  including Jerusalem  as well as in theoccupied Syrian territories in the Golan. As affirmedby many delegations in their statements this session the international community must be wary and mustdemand that the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip be afull withdrawal from land  sea  and air in order for it tobe considered a complete withdrawal. Moreover  thiswithdrawal cannot be accepted as a cover for thecontinued Israeli occupation of the West Bank and EastJerusalem  nor can it be a cover for the continuedexistence of settlements and the separation wall inthese territories  especially since the General Assemblyhas expressed its support for the legal opinion of theInternational Court of Justice on the illegitimate natureof the wall. Israel has rejected the opinion.In 1981  the Security Council passed resolution497 (1981)  deeming the Israeli decision to annex theGolan null and void. The General Assembly has passeddozens of resolutions condemning all the measures andactions taken by Israel ó the occupying Power ó tochange the nature of the occupied Syrian Golan and itslegal status and considering such measures null andvoid and a blatant violation of international law and theGeneva Conventions. In defiance of resolutions ofinternational legitimacy  Israel has evicted almost halfa million Syrians from their land and continues todetain dozens of Syrians  some of whom have beenimprisoned for over 30 years. Israel still calls for theconstruction of more settlements in the occupiedSyrian territories. The question is: If Israel claims thatwithdrawing its settlers is painful and if it is genuine inits desire for peace in the region  then why does itsGovernment continue to build settlements and bringsettlers in to the occupied Syrian and Palestinian Arabterritories?Syria has exerted every effort possible to achievea just and comprehensive peace in the region. It hascontinued to declare its readiness to resume the peaceprocess unconditionally  keeping in mind that theimplementation of resolutions of internationallegitimacy is not considered a precondition. However all these efforts have gone to waste because of Israelísgreed and its defiance of international legitimacy.Therefore  we would like to affirm that peace inthe Middle East  to which the international communityaspires  cannot be achieved unless Israel abides by theresolutions of international legitimacy  particularlySecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973)  the principle of land for peace and the MadridPeace Conference terms of reference  and unless it21accepts the initiative that was put forth by the ArabStates at the 2002 Beirut summit and reaffirmed at theTunis and Algiers summits.The international community is following thetragic events that have been unfolding in sisterly Iraqas a result of its occupation and the attempts tofragment the unity of its land and its people. We arenow facing a tragic situation that has led to the death ofthousands of innocent Iraqis and to the destruction ofthat sisterly countryís infrastructure. Guided by ourdesire to stem the bloodshed  we have taken manymeasures  which has put a burden on our resources.Syria has deployed thousands of its soldiers alongthe Iraqi-Syrian border. We have also intercepted manyof those attempting to infiltrate the border into Iraq. Incontrast  those who ceaselessly hurl accusations atSyria have failed to shoulder their responsibility toensure effective control of the border from the otherside. The responsibility is shared between the twoneighbouring countries. Although some had promisedto assist us and provide technical equipment for bordercontrol  they have failed to keep their promises.Syria condemns the acts of terrorism thatcontinue to be perpetrated throughout Iraq  causingmany casualties among innocent civilians. We stressthat preserving the unity of Iraqís territory and peoplein these critical times requires a full commitment tonational unity on the part of all segments and groups ofthe Iraqi population. Furthermore  Syria condemns allstatements aimed at creating discord and infightingamong the Iraqi people. Such statements have beendisseminated by suspect groups that wish to spreadchaos  extinguish hope and exacerbate suffering. Syriawill continue to support the political process in Iraq until the country and its people overcome their plightand are able to exercise their right to self-determination in a unified  secure and prosperous Iraq.Syria welcomes the interest shown by the UnitedNations and its Member States in combating anderadicating terrorism. I find it necessary to affirm thatSyria was one of the first countries to experienceterrorism and that it has fought to eradicate it. Fromthis rostrum  Syria reaffirms that it will continue tocooperate with all States seeking to eradicate terrorismand implement all relevant Security Councilresolutions.Furthermore  Syria has signed and ratifiedinternational conventions on terrorism  including  mostrecently  the International Convention for theSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism  which wesigned on the first day it was open for signature 14 September 2005. Syria emphasizes that it iscrucially important to avoid confusing terrorism ówhich we are combating and sincerely cooperating toeradicate ó with the just struggle of peoples forliberation and independence  seeking to put an end toforeign occupation. That is a right guaranteed by theCharter of the United Nations  which most MemberStates of the Organization hold dear. Syria was alsoamong the first countries to initiate  in 1986  theproposal that an international conference be convenedunder United Nations auspices to define terrorism andconsider its root causes.The outcome of the Review Conference of theParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) held several months agorevealed the need to refocus international efforts onnuclear disarmament and to ensure the Treatyísuniversality. The facts clearly indicate the importanceof returning to the principle of multilateralism and ofmaking operational the various multilateralinternational conventions on disarmament issues.At any rate  the Middle East region continues toexperience a unique situation that is both a source ofconcern and a cause for censure. Israel alone runs adangerous military nuclear programme outside anyinternational framework and refuses to adhere to theNPT  while all the other States of the region are partyto the Treaty and respect it in letter and spirit. Here  Imust recall once again Syriaís initiative  proposed onbehalf of all the Arab States to the Security Council on29 December 2003  to eradicate all weapons of massdestruction  including nuclear weapons  from theMiddle East region as a step towards declaring it azone free of all weapons of mass destruction  includingbanning nuclear weapons and preventing theirproliferation.Syria is undergoing a serious process ofcomprehensive economic and social reforms. TheSyrian human development plan is modelled on theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs); thus theplan's objectives serve as stepping stones towards theultimate achievement of the MDGs. The SyrianGovernmentís strategy is based on the principles ofcooperation for development  as reflected in theconcept of an effective development partnership amongthe State  the private sector and civil society. Syria is22striving to develop domestic investment  to encourageforeign investment and to improve the infrastructureand the performance of our institutions  whileeliminating waste and fighting corruption.Important reports have recently been prepared incoordination with the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  including an analysis of themacroeconomic situation; reports on poverty  nationaldevelopment and the Millennium Goals; and a HumanDevelopment Report on education. Syria accords dueimportance and attention to empowering women andpromoting their rights so that they can fulfil their role.In addition  Syria attaches great importance tochildren  to persons with special needs and the disabledwith a view to securing their future.Syria supports reform of the Security Councilaimed at improving its working methods  includingincreasing its transparency. As I have previouslystressed  we believe in the importance of justrepresentation of all regions in the Council through theexpansion of both the permanent and the non-permanent membership categories  and the need forrepresentation of the Arab States through a permanentseat in any Council expansion.Africa remains at the centre of Syria's concerns.Without stability in Africa  there will never be genuinedevelopment in the world. The Summit Outcomedocument (resolution 60/1) calls for sufficient effortsto satisfy the special needs of Africa. We believe thatthat is necessary and correct. We do not believe that theSecurity Council can resolve Africa's problems byholding more meetings on the continent. It is moreimportant to achieve concrete results by responding toAfrica's voice  respecting its viewpoints and taking itsconcerns into account. In that regard  we should like topay tribute to the efforts of the African Union  asreflected in its mediation and good offices aimed atcrisis settlement in Africa.The modern world and multilateral diplomacy represented in the United Nations  stand at thethreshold of a new era. Let us all rise to the challengesconfronting us so that we may guarantee a future ofsecurity  peace and stability for mankind."
"158",6709,"TCD",60,2005,"On behalfof my delegation and on my own behalf I would like toextend our warm congratulations to President Eliassonon his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its sixtieth session and to ensure him ofour cooperation in carrying out his noble mission. Iwould also like to congratulate his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Jean Ping  who guided our work withtact  skill and competence throughout his term  in spiteof the delicate and complex issues that were on theagenda during the fifty-ninth session.It is clear that the results that we have reached inrecent years  both in terms of peacekeeping and in ourapproach to development issues  have been madepossible by the commendable commitment anddevotion of each and every Member  at all levels ofengagement and responsibility. I would specificallylike to underscore the valuable contribution ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan  to whom I pay a welldeserved tribute.In his report  entitled “In larger freedom: towardsdevelopment  security and human rights for all”(A/59/2005)  our Secretary-General submitted specificproposals that we rightfully believe are appropriatesolutions to our shared concerns. Effectiveimplementation of those measures will enhance theeffectiveness and credibility of the United Nations andwill help us to meet the myriad challenges facingtoday’s world.A few days ago the heads of State andGovernment reviewed the international situation fromthe standpoint of the Millennium Declaration adoptedin 2000 and the implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. The conclusions clearly indicatethe magnitude of the task that still remains to beaccomplished  despite the efforts made by MemberStates and their national constituents. Thoseconclusions  which corroborate the analysis of theSecretary-General  tell us that times have changed andthat the world — while it still bears scars from thepast — has already entered into the future. Today  weare seeing the unparalleled impoverishment of manycountries and peoples  as well as the emergence of newabhorrent phenomena  such as terrorism andtransboundary crime  not to mention the pandemic ofHIV/AIDS and the resurgence of other communicablediseases. Given those formidable developments  it isabsolutely necessary to build a new internationalsociety that is more caring  more just and bettermanaged  with the United Nations at its centre.For its part  the Government of Chad  since theestablishment of democracy in 1990  has planned andimplemented a vast programme of institutionaltransformation that promotes social and economicdevelopment  peace and security  both domestic andexternal. Moreover  we held a constitutionalreferendum in June to amend a number ofprovisions — a clear demonstration of our concern toadapt our institutions to present-day demands  as wellas an opportunity for our people to renew theirconfidence in those institutions.While our country has achieved sufficientstability within  that is not true of our borders. We aresuffering from the impacts of an insecurity that isprevalent among our neighbours  particularly in theCentral African Republic and the Sudan  with whichChad shares very long borders. Therefore  prompted byour border security concerns  we have undertakenmediation initiatives to reconcile the belligerents. Forthose reasons  the Government of Chad took theinitiative to bring together the parties to the conflict inDarfur  at Abéché  Chad  in September 2003  to makethem listen to reason. Since then  the Government hasworked continually and actively towards helping toreach a negotiated solution to that conflict  withsupport from the African Union and representatives ofthe international community. Moreover  in spite of hisheavy schedule  President Idriss Deby has becomepersonally involved in trying to bring about a pacificsettlement to that fratricidal conflict.Chad’s mediation led to the conclusion of theN’Djamena and the Abuja agreements in Nigeria where talks are still under way to find a comprehensivepolitical agreement and to put an end once and for allto the crisis that has gone on for far too long. Chad willcontinue to act as a mediator so that one day thewestern region of the Sudan can at long last regain itscalm and stability.We deplore the violations of the ceasefire that arecurrently taking place in Darfur and hope that they willcease. We must welcome the formation of the newGovernment of the Sudan and we are hoping that thatwill be an opportunity for an acceleration of the peaceprocess of Abuja.In Chad  we are duty-bound to work with ourbrothers in the Sudan  with whom we have historical8and geographic ties. But we should not lose sight of theimpacts and consequences of the conflict  which havetaken a heavy toll  in particular on the borderpopulations. For instance  Chad took a fully sovereigndecision to welcome more than 200 000 Sudaneserefugees and is providing many forms of support toother humanitarian institutions that are operating in theaffected zone. Indeed  the disruption of trade  thedeterioration of major roads by humanitarian convoysand all the other costs eat up our meagre resources andare the most common source of political unrest amongour own people  who feel that they have beenabandoned. Given the scarcity of our resources and theimmense needs of refugees and populations in refugeeareas  the Government of Chad is counting onsubstantial assistance from the internationalcommunity.The positive developments in the situation in theCentral African Republic are facilitating the restorationof constitutional order in that brotherly country.However  the incidence of crime spilling across thatcountry’s common borders with Chad and Cameroon isincreasing. That phenomenon has caused a new flow ofCentral African refugees into Chad and they live invery difficult conditions. We call upon the internationalcommunity to devote greater attention to their plight.We welcome the initiative taken in that regard bythe United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in theCentral African Republic  which brought togetherrepresentatives of Cameroon  Chad and the CentralAfrican Republic at Yaoundé on 26 and 27 August toconsider the phenomenon of insecurity on theircommon borders and to find solutions to it.Of course  the insecurity on our borders shouldnot cause us to lose sight of other crises in Africa andthroughout the world. In Africa  we welcome thedevelopments in Guinea-Bissau  Burundi and Liberia to mention only those brotherly countries.Undoubtedly  the issue of their reconstruction will havean important place on the agendas of those countries of the African Union and of the rest of the world.On the other hand  the situation in Côte d’Ivoirecontinues to concern us. President Mbeki’s mediationhas not been able to lead — as had been hoped — tothe immediate holding of presidential elections. Weurge our Ivorian brethren to engage in dialogue.In the Middle East  the persistence of the Israeli-Arab conflict continues to poison relations in thesubregion  even while the withdrawal from the GazaStrip is a tangible element in recent developments. Weare convinced that it is only through dialogue that ajust and lasting solution to that conflict can be found.With regard to the disagreement between thePeople’s Republic of China and Taiwan  we appreciateTaiwan’s tireless efforts to reach a peaceful solution.The international community must encourage the twoparties to accept each other. The readmission of Taiwaninto the United Nations  which we believe to be alegitimate demand of that country  would be the pointof departure for such acceptance.The interdependence of the concepts ofdevelopment  peace and security is the basis of ourcountry’s support for the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs). The Millennium Declaration wasundoubtedly a strong signal from the partnership ofrich and poor countries in favour of a fairer  morebalanced and more united world. In itself  it is a greatendeavour that could lead to the consolidation ofglobal efforts.My country has set for itself the same objectivesin its development strategies  plans and programmes asare found in the Millennium Declaration  particularlyour national poverty reduction strategy and ournational strategy for good governance. Undoubtedly for most of our countries  achieving the MDGs is notvery likely  particularly in the areas of promoting peaceand security  good governance and economic and socialreforms.There is in Chad  however  a consensus regardingthe need for sustained progress on those issues and inother areas related to social  economic and politicallife. The Government of Chad is  therefore  focusing inparticular on activities relating to the protection ofchildren  the promotion of maternal health  theeducation of girls and the social and professionalintegration of underprivileged groups  particularlywomen  the elderly and the disabled. In thatconnection  there is no doubt that the partnershipbetween civil society and the private sector is beingstrongly encouraged.I am not unaware that many delegations maywonder about the current situation with regard tosocio-economic development in Chad following theexploitation of oil there. The fact that Chad joined thesmall circle of oil exporting countries two years ago although it caused some euphoria in my country  has9not attracted the expected financial resources.Unfortunately  Chad  under the agreements linking it tothe oil consortium  benefits from only a smallproportion of the revenues resulting from its oil. Wecontinue to need the cooperation and assistance offriendly countries to supplement our resources  whichstill fall short of our needs. Such cooperation isessential if we are to carry out our development andanti-poverty programmes.As members are aware  my country’sdevelopment depends partly on the cotton crop  whichunfortunately is in a state of crisis that is becomingendemic. That crop  which provides a living for muchof Chad’s population  is dangerously threatened by theprotectionist practices of developed countries. In fact our cotton producers are victims of the subsidy policiesof countries that are supposed to comply with the rulesof international trade. Measures must be taken to limitthe effects of the market economy  which isincreasingly restricting our weak economies. Webelieve that well-regulated economic trade wouldensure sustainable development for the least advancedcountries and would help to build confidence amongStates.We are uncertain of reaching a political solutionto the cotton problem  despite the hopes placed incontinued multilateral trade negotiations within theframework of the Doha Round. It is no longer certainthat developed countries will agree to abandon theirsubsidy practices and implement radical changes in thecurrent system to meet the expectations of Africancotton growers. That would leave no choice but toresort to political and legal action under the provisionsof the statutes and rules of the World TradeOrganization with a view to regulating the cottonmarket through measures to compensate the lossessuffered by our producers.Most Member States had hoped that this sixtiethsession of the General Assembly would finally achievethe democratization of the United Nations. That doesnot yet seem to be the case. But we must not losemomentum  and we must continue to work to ensurethat that objective is attained in the near future. Therevitalization of the General Assembly and of theEconomic and Social Council and the transformation ofthe Commission on Human Rights into an importantUnited Nations body  as suggested by the Secretary-General  would enable the Organization to be moreeffective. In such a restructuring  which remainsrelevant  the issue of Security Council expansion is ofinterest to Member States  particularly those ofAfrica — and quite rightly  because we know that sincethe creation of the United Nations in 1945  no AfricanState has had a seat on the Council as a permanentmember with the right of the veto. That injusticeseriously mars the credibility of the United Nations and it is time to rectify it.Our position regarding a new configuration forthe Security Council remains that which has beenreaffirmed many times by the African Union. It reflectsour firm will to participate in the efforts of theinternational community under United Nationsauspices aimed at ensuring the maintenance of peaceand security  which are guarantees for sustainableeconomic and social development."
"159",6755,"TGO",60,2005,"At theoutset  allow me  on behalf of the people andGovernment of Togo and on my own behalf  to extendour warmest congratulations to you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits sixtieth session. I also assure you of the support andcooperation of the Togolese delegation  confident as Iam that your experience and outstanding qualities willprove to be a major asset in ensuring that our work atthis session will be commensurate with the great stakesand global challenges that we must meet together.I also convey to your predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping our deep appreciation for the immense work heundertook with marvellous enthusiasm throughout hismandate. With commitment and insight  the qualities ofa seasoned diplomat in service to his country  Gabon and to Africa  he effectively guided the work of thepreceding session  including the debates held in recentdays on the Millennium Development Goals.I also take this opportunity to pay vibrant tributeto the Secretary-General  our brother Kofi Annan whose commitment to the United Nations and to thegreat causes and noble ideals it embodies has allowedus to register critical progress in improving the qualityand effectiveness of the United Nations operations. Ipledge him my country's full support in the ongoingmission we have entrusted to him  which he has carriedout with competence  serenity  resolve and humanism.The United Nations is now at a crossroads. Thechallenges that continue to face the world - inparticular the ongoing conflicts that are ravaging manycountries and regions around the world; the pandemics floods and natural disasters; the terrible dangers thatthreaten the environment and the ecosystem; famine invarious places  particularly in Africa  caused bydrought and climate change; and the growing gulfbetween the wealthy countries and those afflicted byunderdevelopment - require greater solidarity  theurgent reform of our Organization  and the adaptationof its bodies and operations to the new internationalcontext.My country  Togo  will therefore firmly supportthe United Nations reform process  as outlined in thereport of the High-level Panel on Threats  Challengesand Change  entitled ""A more secure world: our sharedresponsibility"" (A/59/565). Indeed  we absolutely mustreaffirm certain fundamental principles and ideals thatguided the founding fathers of the United Nations. Wemust devise strategies and working methods that arebolder and better adapted to the scope and seriousnessof problems that cannot be effectively resolved exceptin the framework of this Organization  a symbol ofsolidarity and brotherhood among States and peoples.We need to pursue and step up our fight againstpoverty and hunger  the lack of education  genderinequality  child mortality  disease  environmentaldegradation  and devastating and lethal conflicts.I take this opportunity  on behalf of theGovernment and people of Togo  to convey our deepgratitude and thanks to the community of Statesrepresented here for its many expressions of supportand sympathy for our country after the unexpected29demise of President Gnassingbé Eyadema and in thecontext of Togo's difficulties in the wake of his death.Very fortunately  Togo has emerged from thatperiod of unrest and instability. Calm and serenity nowreign and promise a new era of hope for our country. Infact  in spite of the tension and violence that markedthe electoral process  Togo has continued since then tomake tangible progress in peacefully reorganizing itssocial and political life. The representatives of allpolitical persuasions and civil society have togetherestablished a Government of national unity. Moreover in accordance with our desire for openness anddialogue  we have launched consultations with theTogolese political class and civil society in order toreach a broad consensus and mobilization in managingthe process of national reconciliation and in efforts toensure the return and reintegration of refugees. Theconsultations also mark the onset of a politicaldialogue that will allow us  through joint effort  toagree on electoral reform  the reorganization ofregulatory bodies and institutions  and the stages andschedule of legislative elections.Safeguarding human rights and fundamentalfreedoms  enshrining the values and practices ofdemocracy  and strengthening the rule of law and goodgovernance are at the heart of the 22 commitments thatmy country approved on 14 April 2004 with theEuropean Union. They are also at the very core of ouraction and of the demands and expectations of myfellow citizens. Immediately following theestablishment of the Government  we therefore adoptedbold measures and initiatives in various sectors.A special independent national commission ofinquiry was created to investigate the violence andvandalism committed during the electoral process.Similarly  Togolese authorities at all levels have fullycooperated with the United Nations fact-find missionmandated to look into the violence and allegations ofhuman rights violations committed between 5 Februaryand 5 May 2005. The mission's conclusions andrecommendations  which I believe will be useful andpromising  will be considered in a spirit of open-mindedness and with a view to correcting potentialareas of weakness so that we may never againexperience acts of violence in future elections in Togo.In an effort to restore calm and reduce tension  allpersons detained for their suspected involvement andresponsibility in acts of violence  atrocities  pillagingof property and ransacking of buildings during theelections have been released. Also  with a view tostrengthening citizens' confidence in the Republic'sinstitutions  we have just launched a wide-rangingprogramme to reform the justice system.Today  we reaffirm that democracy spurs theharmonious and sustainable socio-economicdevelopment of Togo. In that respect  effectiveness andtransparency in the management of the affairs of thecapital and respect for human rights are importantresponsibilities of the Government of Togo.However  it is clear that the young democracy ofTogo needs the international community's support inorder to help democracy to take firm root and tostrengthen peace and stability in West Africa. I takethis opportunity to express once again the gratitude ofthe people of Togo to the African Union and theEconomic Community of West African States for theirassistance to Togo during such a crucial period.Building a State where the rule of law prevails isa long-term effort; it is achieved gradually and requiresconsolidation at each step. That is true for all greatdemocracies. I therefore call on all our developmentpartners to support Togo in its steadfast andirreversible march towards a democratic  law-basedState in which all Togolese can fully exercise theirfundamental rights and can act  think and create incomplete freedom.In conclusion  I would like to underline onceagain the merits of international solidarity  in particularbetween the prosperous countries and the developingcountries. In fact  we live in an increasinglyinterdependent world that faces multiple threats andchallenges. Those threats spare no State  large or small and make it imperative that we take coordinated andunited action  in particular in those situations thatjeopardize international peace and security.Africa  in particular  remains a zone of conflictsand instability  and this exacerbates the feelings ofhelplessness and distress among our peoples. Wewelcome the engagement and the support of theinternational community  in particular in Cote d'Ivoire the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region.We welcome encouraging signs in the peaceprocess in Burundi. However  we call on the UnitedNations and the international community to remainvigilant and active in helping the brotherly people ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  whose country30is moving towards stability and the completion of itselectoral process.Cote d'Ivoire must quickly return to the path ofpeace and harmony in order to pursue a leading role inthe efforts for political and economic integration inWest Africa.But we believe that it would be wise to taketimely action to address the causes of those conflicts rather than intervene at a later date to deal with theoften devastating consequences. We should thereforereflect together on how to address the root causes ofthose situations.That leads me to make two suggestions for theAssembly to ponder.First  regarding institutions  Africa must put inplace democratic institutions of a new kind  founded onthe value of dialogue and the ongoing search forcompromise and consensus  closer to our tradition ofdiscussion than to the imposition of the majoritydecision.Second  we need to strengthen the managementcapabilities of States whose administration is still weakin order to improve the quality and the effectiveness ofthe public and administrative services  thus putting theState at the service of its citizens.I hope that our Organization will strengthen itsaction to make national administrations more effectiveand more accessible for citizens. By doing so  theUnited Nations would further realize its vocation as anirreplaceable forum for dialogue and solidarity in theservice of humanity  the well-being of peoples and themaintenance of international peace and security."
"160",6800,"THA",60,2005,"On behalf ofthe delegation of Thailand  I would like to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its sixtieth session. The GeneralAssembly’s task this year is as crucial as the one thatMr. Jean Ping  your predecessor  has just completed.My delegation truly appreciated the strong leadershipof Mr. Ping during one of the most challenging periodsfor the United Nations. My delegation’s appreciationalso goes to the Secretary-General for his tirelessefforts and active role.Permit me at the outset to express my heartfeltcondolences to the American people for the devastationcaused by Hurricane Katrina. Having suffered from theAsian tsunami ourselves last December  our hearts aretruly with the American people. In the aftermath of thetsunami  we were deeply touched by the outpouring ofsupport coming to us from around the world. Ourfriends were determined to do everything possible tohelp us get through our darkest days. The Thai peopleshared this spirit  and we also lent a hand to ourneighbours suffering from the same calamity. We areseeing the whole world show the same spirit of sharedresponsibility coming to the United States in theaftermath of Hurricane Katrina. We need to moveforward with this same spirit  this same sense of sharedresponsibility  as we tackle the old and new challengesof our modern world of globalization.There is certainly much to do. In many countries extreme poverty  hunger  deadly infectious diseasesand environmental degradation continue to do damage.They are silent killers. We cannot and must not ignorethem. Every day  50 000 people continue to perishfrom poverty and hunger; 30 000 children will notsurvive to celebrate their fifth birthday. Yet  moneybeing spent on arms and weapons continues to outpacemoney being spent on sustaining lives. This isunacceptable.Sixty years ago  the desire to achieve unity indiversity with shared responsibility led to the creationof the United Nations. Now at 60  the United Nationsis living in a world very different from that of 1945.Today  challenges to human security and economicdevelopment can be just as dangerous to theinternational community as traditional challenges in20the form of military conflicts. The United Nations mustbe able to act effectively to serve the world’s peoples.The outcome document that was adopted by theHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly(resolution 60/1) reflects the shared commitment ofworld leaders to development  peace and security  aswell as human rights and human dignity. It sets thestage for the attainment of peace and prosperitythroughout the world.As difficult as it was to reach a consensus on theoutcome document  I believe that it will be even moredifficult to translate this consensus into concreteaction. The road ahead will not be an easy one totravel. We must stay focused on our commonaspirations as we face the difficulties that lie ahead.Thailand intends to work with the United Nationsand with all Member States to ensure that the vision ofour leaders and the aspirations of our peoples lead toconcrete results. We will actively participate inaddressing issues such as the revitalization of theGeneral Assembly  the strengthening of the Economicand Social Council  the reform of the Security Counciland the establishment of the Human Rights Council.We see merit in the idea of collectiveresponsibility to protect people from genocide  warcrimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.To achieve lasting peace and prosperity  Thailandstrongly supports the establishment of thePeacebuilding Commission as a mechanism to ensuresustainable post-conflict recovery and development.We also want to see extensive management reform tomake the Secretariat more efficient  more effective and also more accountable.We must redouble our efforts to break thevicious circle of poverty  disease and conflicts. Thechallenge of our time is to make peace  prosperity dignity and freedom common to all. As Chair of theHuman Security Network  we are pleased that ahuman-centred approach to security has been embracedas an integral part of the new collective securityconsensus.The eradication of poverty must not be only adream. We must make it happen. The United Nationsmust mobilize all relevant agencies and marshalresources to help developing countries progress in asustainable way. Developing countries must be able toidentify and leverage their inner strengths and theircomparative advantages. Capacity-building andtechnical assistance should be readily available. Withthe right policies and strategies as well as theappropriate infrastructure  developing countries canleapfrog up the development ladder in our modernworld by making full use of globalization.In that connection  we in Thailand have adopted apeople-centred development policy which stands sideby side with democracy and good governance. At theinternational level  we are actively pursuing trade andinvestment liberalization. This is our dual-track policy.National efforts must be backed by a supportiveglobal environment. That means making internationaltrade free and fair  so that it can be an effective enginefor sustainable development. When we talk about freetrade  we must be mindful that not everyone is equallyfit to compete in the same system of free competition.Two days ago  from this same rostrum  my PrimeMinister emphasized that a patient who has just beenreleased from the intensive care unit of a hospitalcannot run a race under the same rules and conditionsas a fit athlete. That is so true.Thailand welcomes the reaffirmation of theMonterrey Consensus and other proposals oninnovative financing for development. Financialassistance given to developing countries must gotowards empowering the recipient countries. We mustavoid creating more dependency traps. We must worktogether on the basis of partnership for sustainabledevelopment.Partnership is also vital in the area of energy. Therapid rise in global oil prices is very harmful todevelopment and has the potential to roll back many ofthe hard-won gains of developing countries. The higherthe price of oil  the longer it will take for manydeveloping countries to realize the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. The United Nations should help tomobilize worldwide cooperation to ensure energysecurity as well as to develop alternative sources ofclean energy.The United Nations must also do more topromote synergy among Member States through thefacilitation of partnership building  such as North-South  South-South and trilateral cooperation. We wantto see a new and enhanced strategic partnership fordevelopment between the United Nations and itsMember States.21In South-East Asia  that is the spirit that istransforming the region. For its part  Thailand has beenreaching out to forge partnerships for developmentworldwide. Through regional cooperation fordevelopment initiatives  such as the Ayeyawady-ChaoPhraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy(ACMECS); the Bay of Bengal Initiative forMultisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation(BIMSTEC); and the Asia Cooperation Dialogue(ACD)  Thailand is constructing layers of buildingblocks that support the development work of theUnited Nations.We have shown through our actions thatassistance for development is not just a one-way roadfrom North to South. The countries of the South cansignificantly help one another to prosper togetherthrough South-South cooperation. Here  we in Thailandhave been working closely with other developingcountries  sharing our experiences and best practices especially in areas in which Thailand has expertise such as agricultural development and public health.Marginalization breeds resentment and anger both of which are fertile ground for extremism toflourish. Development helps to prevent this. Putting ahuman face on globalization is as vital as it is urgent.Together  we can create an environment conducive toturning back the tide of violent extremism anddiscrediting the appeal of terrorism. Religious andcultural identities must also be recognized andrespected. This is unity in diversity. This is the path ofmoderation and understanding. This is also a peacefulway to fight violence and terrorism. Here  we mustcondemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations by whomever committed  wherever and for whateverpurposes.We have so much on our agenda. The road aheadwill not be an easy one. We must work together toensure that we can build strength from diversity  with avery strong sense of shared responsibility. Let us makethe United Nations truly serve the people  no matterwho they are and no matter where they are. Let usensure that “We the peoples of the United Nations” cantruly live our lives “in larger freedom”  as envisionedby our founding fathers 60 years ago."
"161",6825,"TJK",60,2005,"Therecently convened High-level Plenary Meeting at thelevel of heads of State or Government can rightly bereferred to as the major historical event of thebeginning of the new millennium. It is important that at the summit  the international community not onlyreiterated previously undertaken commitments but alsotook new  concrete decisions for their practicalimplementation. Most importantly  world leadersclearly stated that there is no alternative to the UnitedNations as an international Organization that cancoordinate efforts to address the challenges faced byhumankind.Through the common political will of worldleaders  a unique opportunity has arisen to strengthenjoint efforts towards peaceful and sustainable social23and economic development and the achievement of theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs); to progresstowards the eradication of poverty and disease; toovercome humanitarian crises; and to provide a betterworld for present and future generations.Further progress requires united  concerted andconsistent action on the part of the internationalcommunity as a whole. There is no doubt that theUnited Nations must play a key role in mobilizing andcoordinating such efforts. We share the view that it isnecessary to strengthen the Organization and itsspecialized agencies  including through the urgentreform of the Secretariat and of other United Nationsbodies.Tajikistan welcomes the outcome of theSeptember summit and is prepared to meet all thecommitments and implement all the decisions outlinedin its outcome document. We view them as a pledge bythe international community to devote the necessaryattention to human development challenges and  to thatend  to channel additional financial resources tocountries in extreme need  such as Tajikistan.The Millennium Development Goals must remainthe focus of our efforts. There is no doubt that  at thenational level  the pace of  and priorities in  theimplementation of the MDGs must be adapted to theconditions prevailing in particular countries  each ofwhich has its own way of doing things and its ownparticular characteristics.Tajikistan aims to achieve maximum progress inthe implementation of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. Despite the difficulties we face  we have madereal progress towards attaining them. According to theWorld Bank  noticeable positive changes have occurredin the area of poverty reduction: in recent years thenumber of people living below the poverty line hasdecreased by 16 per cent.It is clear that progress has been made in ensuringfood security  which is among the key priorities inTajikistan. The Government’s objectives include thedevelopment of agriculture and the creation within it ofa viable private sector  and  at a minimum  a threefoldincrease in the income of rural households.We fully agree with the conclusions reached inthe Millennium Development Goals Needs Assessmentreport submitted to the Secretary-General by a team ofexperts led by Jeffrey Sachs  which state that Tajikistanhas a unique opportunity to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  in the context of their majorparameters  by 2015. Successful achievement of theenvisaged targets will allow Tajikistan to become  inCentral Asia  an example of an emerging democracycharacterized by equality and prosperity.Tajikistan is currently at a turning point in itsdevelopment. The armed conflict was resolved within ashort period of time  and the complex peacebuildingphase  which is being successfully implemented withUnited Nations support  is approaching its conclusion.Over the last five years  with the involvement of theUnited Nations Office in Tajikistan  the country hassuccessfully travelled the difficult road of nationalreconciliation  enhancing its stability  establishingdemocratic institutions  promoting the rule of law andensuring respect for human rights.Stability and the implementation of first-generation reforms have brought about a speedyincrease in gross domestic product  with an annualincrease of 9.3 per cent over the past five years. Therehabilitation of the country's economy is progressing.At the same time  the Republic's authorities have aclear idea of the scale and complexity of the problemsfacing the country and are fully aware of theirresponsibilities in addressing social and economicproblems  and they are undertaking every possiblemeasure for their resolution.Tajikistan is one the first countries in the world tohave generated  with the assistance of the UnitedNations  an estimate of the overall costs and resourcesrequired for the implementation of the MDGs. TheMillennium Development Goals Needs Assessmentidentified the fundamental structural and institutionalreforms needed in Tajikistan to create an enablingenvironment for achieving the MDGs; policy prioritiesin respective sectors; and financial schemes for fundingthe development of rural areas  the educational andhealth systems  the water supply and sanitationinfrastructures  and the environment.According to The Millennium DevelopmentGoals Needs Assessment  Tajikistan will need about$13 billion over the next 10 years to achieve therequired progress in the implementation of the MDGs.However  the Millennium Development GoalsNeeds Assessment is only the first concrete measure.Based on that document  a National Strategy forDevelopment for 2006-2008 and a more detailed24Strategy for Poverty Reduction for 2006-2008 arecurrently being elaborated in Tajikistan. Thesemeasures  undertaken by the Government of Tajikistan fully accord with the decisions of the summit on theelaboration of national strategies for development.Tajikistan's social and economic developmentwill depend largely on the international community'sapproach to addressing existing challenges  includingpoverty eradication; development financing; thecreation of an equitable system of world trade; thealleviation of the consequences of natural disasters;and the resolution of demographic problems. That iswhy the summit's decisions on such a crucial issue asdevelopment financing are of pivotal importance forTajikistan.Allow me briefly to touch on some key issues.I turn first to needs related to official assistancefor development. In cooperation with United Nationsexperts  we assessed our needs in this area in a detailedand transparent manner. Currently  our financialrequirements for sustainable development considerablyexceed the available federal and external resources. Ofthe $930 million that international donors havecommitted to allocate to Tajikistan during the period2003-2005  only 40 per cent has actually beenprovided. We call on the international community todouble  at a minimum  existing aid for theimplementation of the MDGs.Reducing the burden of foreign debt is of specialimportance for us  since the funds released can beinvested in development. Due to the efforts undertakenby the Government to reduce the burden of servicingforeign debt  some progress has been achieved in therestructuring of bilateral debts in recent years.However  in the near future  the debt burden willremain heavy. According to estimates  this year debtwill equal more than 40 per cent of gross domesticproduct  and it will continue to pose a threat to themacro-economic stability of the country and to plansfor development.The economy and trade in Tajikistan depend to alarge extent on favourable conditions in the worldmarket. Tajikistan hopes for the successful completionof the Doha round of trade negotiations within theWorld Trade Organization  in order that it may fullyrealize its potential in the field of development and sothat progress can be made towards an open andequitable system of world trade.Lack of access to the sea and remoteness fromworld markets significantly increase transittransportation expenditures  make it harder for thecountry to participate in world trade and directly affectthe poverty rate in the country. In that context  thepromotion of regional cooperation  primarily withneighbouring countries  is a key factor for theachievement of the MDGs in Tajikistan.Our region faces specific problems  given that theestablishment of an environment conducive todeveloping trade relations and the promotion ofeconomic relations as a whole depends  in manyrespects  on the success of the stabilization andpeacebuilding processes in neighbouring Afghanistan.With respect to the country's post-conflictrehabilitation  it is clear that  at the regional level active involvement by the States of Central Asianeighbouring Afghanistan in its development will bekey to the success of the efforts undertaken there.In this connection  Tajikistan believes that it isabsolutely essential that Afghanistan share in themultifaceted process of regional cooperation. Weexpect our region's leading international partners toprovide appropriate support for that process. Indeed that issue could be considered by the new UnitedNations Peacebuilding Commission.Although we rely on international assistance  theGovernment of Tajikistan is making increased effortsto utilize the country's own capacity to the fullestextent. Tajikistan's water resources offer enormousadvantages in terms of the implementation of theMDGs. Unfortunately  less than 5 per cent of theirpotential is currently being exploited.Rational and fair management of water resourceswill contribute directly to progress towards the MDGsby helping to address challenges related to  inter alia food security  employment  sanitation  the reduction ofdisease and increased school attendance. Our commongoal is to develop a qualitatively new pattern ofsustainable water resource management and to addresswater economy challenges at the national  regional andinternational levels by bringing together internationalcommunity support and national efforts  while ensuringthat the countries themselves and even subregionsfacing water supply problems play the leading role.We expect all countries and all of the specializedagencies of the United Nations to take an active part inevents relating to the International Decade for Action25""Water for Life""  the success of which will depend onjoint activities being undertaken. That should make acommon  tangible contribution to the future ofhumankind.As a country that has lived through civil conflict Tajikistan considers progress in the implementation ofthe MDGs to be of special significance. The successfulsocial and economic development of the country is thekey to preventing a recurrence of such conflict. Ourexperience teaches us that creating conditions that canprevent the resumption of conflict and strengthen theprocess of advancing social and economic developmentin countries that have lived through such conflict mustbe among the key goals of the internationalcommunity. In this connection  we fully share theconviction that the United Nations must focus onovercoming and preventing conflict and on post-conflict rehabilitation and development. We hope thatthe new United Nations Peacebuilding Commissionwill expand the capacity of the internationalcommunity to respond to the needs of post-conflictcountries and allow a direct link to be made betweensecurity and development. The Economic and SocialCouncil is called upon to play its role in that process.Tajikistan  which suffered in its struggle forindependence  has resolutely set out on the democraticroad towards development  and will not turn back. Theinternational community  first and foremost the UnitedNations  has made an enormous contribution in thatregard  and for many years we have benefited from itsgenerous assistance and selfless support.We are convinced that the United Nations shouldremain the key body for regulating internationalrelations in the new millennium. We are working onthe assumption that the consolidating function of theUnited Nations should be enhanced. The reform of theOrganization should be rational  and the renewedUnited Nations itself should be strong and capable ofresponding to world events in a swift and propermanner so that it can effectively counteract the manyglobal challenges and threats of a new generation.Tajikistan will make its own contribution in that areawith a view to strengthening the United Nations andenhancing its role in the modern world."
"162",6847,"TKM",60,2005,"Allow me to congratulate the President  on his electionto his high post and to express our confidence in hissuccessful and professional implementation of themandate entrusted to him. Allow me to also expressour gratitude to Mr. Jean Ping for his untiring activityin guiding the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly.Last week the High-level Plenary Meetingconcluded its work  which resulted in the adoption ofan outcome document  reflecting the Meeting’scommitment to attaining the Millennium DevelopmentGoals.The United Nations is an irreplaceable structureof multilateral inter-State interaction. Therefore  thequestion on how it will respond to the hopes andaspirations of every Member will determine itsviability. We agree with the Secretary-General that theOrganization “remains fully engaged in conflictresolution  peacekeeping  humanitarian assistance defence of human rights and development around theworld”. (A/60/PV.2)We support the proposals contained in theoutcome document on strengthening the UnitedNations in areas of development  ensuring collectivesecurity  counteracting terrorism  ensuring the dignityof the individual and reforming the Organization.We are in favour of strengthening the role of theUnited Nations  and urge more transparency in its workand an improvement of its structure. The activities ofits bodies should be conducted on the basis of a wideconsensus among Member States. We welcome theefforts of the Secretary-General aimed at preventingconflicts and strengthening preventive activity in thatarea.We support the efforts against terrorism by theSecurity Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee. Itsrole is invaluable in coordinating and exchanginginformation and analysing trends.The present session is devoted to an appraisal ofthe progress made by States in achieving theMillennium Development Goals. Therefore  allow meto share with you information on how Turkmenistan isimplementing the Goals.Reforms are being implemented in Turkmenistanin the economic and social sphere  in accordance withthe national programme of social and economicdevelopment for the period until 2020. The reformshave assisted in establishing a powerful industrialpotential  creating a market model for administrationand the private sector of economy  and ensuringdignified living conditions for the people.Turkmenistan possesses huge energy resources gas and oil industries being the main sources ofdevelopment of the national economy. The energypotential of Turkmenistan is currently estimated atmore than 45 billion tons of oil equivalent  or a fifth ofall world reserves of natural gas and oil.Thanks to the national programmes developed inthe early years of independence  the reforms haveintroduced a new type of industry. Turkmenistan  by itsown national resources  has invested $30 billion in thenational economy and has built over 1 050 industrialplants and factories possessing highly sophisticatedequipment.We have been successfully developing newbranches of industry  namely  the oil and gas  energy textile and food sectors. In the textile industry  we haveestablished new specialized companies and largeintegrated textile plants  organizing large-scaleproduction of various cotton fibre products  60 per centof which is exported. The textile industry represents28 per cent of the overall volume of production of ourmanufacturing industry.The agrarian sector of the economy hasundergone complete reconstruction. Since the middleof 1995  all collective and State farms have beenabolished. Reform has been directed at transferringland to private ownership and long-term lease andexpanding the areas of privately-held lots. TheGovernment has undertaken measures to stimulateprivate agricultural production. Half of the cost of33technical services is borne by the State. The populationhas been exempted from payment of taxes on land houses  construction and the maintenance of cattle andpoultry. All these and other measures havestrengthened agriculture and have stimulated a growthin production.This year Turkmenistan harvested a record 3.1million tons of wheat. At the current stage ofdevelopment  consumer demand in our country is metmainly by domestic production  practically ensuringfood independence for the country.Turkmenistan attaches great importance to thecreation and expansion of its railway infrastructure which meets the highest modern standards. Today  therailway system of Turkmenistan covers more than2 000 kilometres. In recent years two new railwayswere constructed and a third is under way  which hasincreased the size of the system by nearly 500kilometres.The country has become a vital part of thecommon international transport system. The Trans-Asiatic Railway has created a steel variant of theancient Silk Road  and this connects Turkmenistanwith the countries of Europe and the Asian continentand promotes social and economic development.Turkmenistan attaches great importance to socialprotection. Ensuring dignified living standards security  rights and freedoms of citizens andstrengthening the legal basis of society is our internalpolicy. During the entire transition period  thePresident and Government worked to provide socialsupport to the population. Since 1993 they have givento their citizens gas  electricity  water  salt  healthservices and education free of charge.There is a large-scale housing constructionprogramme. Citizens are guaranteed ownership ofcomfortable well-designed homes on financiallyattractive terms  with loans extending over a 15-yearperiod and the future homeowner’s employer paying50 per cent of the costs. Thanks to free education andgood access  the country has a high level of educationand literacy. Turkmenistan has achieved success inother areas  in particular the protection of the rights ofchildren and the defence of their interests. This is aclear confirmation of our tireless fulfilment of ourobligations under the Convention on the Rights of theChild.Working with the United Nations Children’sFund  in 2000 we successfully implemented a programmefor the protection of mothers and children  thecomprehensive development of children and thepromotion and well-being of the youth.The country has achieved wide immunizationcoverage  which has led to a significant reduction ininfectious diseases among children. A lot of work isbeing carried out in the areas of maternal and childhealth  education and social protection. In Turkmenistan we are the fourth country in the world to be recognizedby the United Nations as a State that has introduceduniversal iodization of salt in accordance with acceptedinternational standards. In this connection it has beennoted that our country consistently carries out itsobligations  not only with regard to iodine deficiencybut also with regard to the micronutrients that areneeded for the development of a growing child’s body.For many centuries  our country has been acrossroads of routes between East and West and Southand North and has been a key link in the Great SilkRoad  which served as a road of peace and dialogue forcultures for almost one and a half thousand years. Thisled to the creation of a special spiritual atmosphere inour Turkmen land  and it is not accidental thereforethat the national mentality of the Turkmens wasgenerated in its essence as internationally oriented seeing the individual as the supreme value  and rootedin openness  tolerance  respect for the culture of otherpeoples and natural peacefulness.The political system of the State recognizes theimportant role played by civil society. Publicassociations and professional and artistic unions playan active role in determining the economic  social andcultural policies of the State.Turkmenistan has historically respected religiousfreedom for its citizens and strictly respects generallyrecognized international norms and principles in thearea of freedom of worship. As a result  more than 100religious organizations are registered in Turkmenistan.The State guarantees the freedom of religion andbelief  the equality of faiths before the law and theright of everyone independently to determine his or herrelationship to religion.Turkmenistan recognizes the primacy ofuniversally recognized norms of international law andhas joined or ratified the fundamental internationalinstruments in the area of human rights. An important34measure in this area has been Turkmenistan’sdeclaration of its status of a permanently neutral State and this has been approved by the General Assembly.Turkmenistan has assumed its international obligationsin that connection and has fulfilled them over the past10 years. These obligations are incorporated in theconstitutional laws on the neutrality of Turkmenistanand on its international obligations in the field ofhuman rights.In 1999 we abolished the death penalty.Turkmenistan has adopted specific political  economicand social measures for the protection of the rights ofrefugees  who arrived in our country between 1991 and1997. During this period  about 20 000 refugees fromTajikistan  Afghanistan  Armenia and other countriesarrived to Turkmenistan. Under the decree of thePresident of Turkmenistan  more than 16 000 of themreceived citizenship or residence permits.We welcome efforts of the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan  aimed atstrengthening the United Nations. We are grateful tothe United Nations  its Secretariat  its specializedagencies such as the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations Children’s Fund  theUnited Nations Population Fund  the World HealthOrganization and others  who have coordinated andprovided invaluable assistance to the development ofour State.Turkmenistan along with many other States hashigh hopes in the United Nations and calls for itsstrengthening and the broadening of its role in theworld."
"163",6860,"TLS",60,2005,"Because of theconstraints on our time  I shall omit several paragraphsof my statement  the full text of which has beendistributed to delegations.The President  the Prime Minister and the peopleof Timor-Leste have conveyed to the people and theGovernment of the United States our profoundsympathy for the people of the Gulf states  in particularthe people of the city of New Orleans  who were thevictims of Hurricane Katrina. President George W.Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice havespoken touching words of gratitude in recognition ofthe outpouring of sympathy from so many nations. Wemust remember that the United States Administrationand the American people were among the first andmost generous to respond to the tsunami tragedy thatbefell the peoples living on the borders of the IndianOcean on 26 December last year.Only a little more than three years ago  theSecretary-General  Kofi Annan  handed over power toour elected President. Since then  we have made realprogress in nation-building  peacebuilding  economicdevelopment  national reconciliation and enhancingrelations with our neighbours. Timor-Leste has accededto the seven main international human rightsinstruments  and my Government is committed tofulfilling its obligations. We were among the first inthe world to pioneer a streamlined treaty reportingprocedure. We are currently drafting our first reports and all Government agencies are participating in thatexercise. The internal political and security situation including our porous common land borders  is peacefuland stable. A recent report of the World Bank commenting on the general situation of peace andstability in my country  stated “Most countries emerging from conflict ... relapseinto violence within five years. Timor-Leste hasavoided that fate  maintained peace and politicalstability  and established security”.As a result of the unexpectedly high prices of oiland gas  Timor-Leste today enjoys a surplus  which hasenabled our Government to increase our publicexpenditure by 30 per cent during the current fiscalyear. That increase will benefit mostly the ruralpopulation and the poorest. In addition  we are proud toreport that 36 per cent of our national budget isallocated to education and health.We have fostered the best possible relationshipswith our neighbours. At of the end of July  we becamethe twenty-fifth member of the Regional Forum of theAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); ournext goal is ASEAN membership. We enjoy specialobserver status in the Pacific Islands Forum. Withoutthe active involvement of our regional andinternational friends  the leadership and coordinatingrole of the United Nations and the engagement of itsmany agencies  of the Bretton Woods institutions andof the Asian Development Bank  we would not havebeen able to achieve the impressive progress we havemade thus far.With regard to truth and reconciliation  I shallnow address the issue of justice. In an effort to uncoverthe truth about the events of 1999  the Governments ofTimor-Leste and Indonesia have established a jointcommission on truth and friendship. The commission ismandated to examine serious acts of violence thatoccurred in the period before  during and after the 30August 1999 popular consultations sponsored by theUnited Nations.We are accused in some quarters of being toopreoccupied with forging close relations withIndonesia  to the detriment of justice for past abuses and in doing so of encouraging impunity. To ouraccusers  we say the following. We are mindful of theneed to accord dignity and respect to the victims ofpast abuses  and we believe that in the pursuit ofjustice we must be sensitive to the need to establish abalance between comprehensive justice and nationalreconciliation in order to avoid perpetuating thedivisions of the past and risking the exacerbation ofexisting cleavages in our society. We believe that ourfirst obligation  as a responsible member of theinternational community  is to build a peaceful  stable democratic and prosperous country. By consolidatingnation-building  internal peace and stability and26unshackling our people from poverty  we cancontribute to wider peace and stability.If one were to read the aforementioned WorldBank report on the developments in my country  onewould reach the same upbeat conclusion about theimpressive gains that we have attained in only threeyears. Let me share with members some additionalfindings:“Timor-Leste  the world’s newest nation was created out of ashes ... Given that the countrystarted from scratch both physically andinstitutionally  Timor-Leste has done remarkablywell”.We have developed a model Petroleum Fund legaland policy regime  which we took directly to thepeople and to the National Parliament for approval. Wedo not want Timor-Leste to fall prey to the developingnations’ so-called resource curse  whereby God-givenresources are squandered. The key principle is thatonly the sustainable income from our petroleum wealthwill be available for current expenditure. Commentingon our Petroleum Fund  the World Bank said thatTimor-Leste“has adopted a state-of-the-art legal frameworkfor on- and off-shore petroleum production andtaxation and a draft savings policy and associatedPetroleum Fund Act consistent with theExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative(EITI) ... having embraced transparencyprinciples even before EITI existed ... True tostated principles  the Government has adhered toa provisional savings policy for petroleumrevenues ahead of the adoption of the permanentsavings policy”.I should now like to touch upon the theme ofUnited Nations reform. As we observe the current newscoverage surrounding the oil-for-food scandal  with theUnited Nations painted as the villain  we are certainlydisappointed that the Organization we idealize istainted by allegations of corruption.In peacekeeping and conflict prevention  we mustremember that while the Secretary-General has theresponsibility to alert the Security Council to ongoingor potential conflicts that may threaten internationalpeace and security  the ultimate decision to act restswith the Security Council  in particular the fivepermanent members. The role of the United Nations inthe world has not  however  been limited topeacekeeping; it has provided facilities and anenvironment for informal meetings between parties inconflict  it has mediated hostage situations or borderdisputes  and it has mobilized resources andcoordinated assistance to war-torn countries or tocommunities affected by natural disasters.While we all agree that our collectiveOrganization has failed at times  those shortcomingsand failures should not obscure its virtues andsuccesses. The United Nations can become moreeffective if regional bodies do their share in addressingthe challenges in their respective regions.Much has been said and written about the needfor a thorough review of the United Nations system and much of the debate has been focused on theSecurity Council  overshadowing all other issues including the much-needed reform of the GeneralAssembly itself. Reform is also urgent in regard to theexisting human rights system. The proliferation oftreaty bodies and agenda items results in a morass ofduplication  waste  inefficiency and loss of focus.The General Assembly remains the prime organof the United Nations that brings together all nations rich and poor  large and small. The endless andrepetitive yearly general debate and agenda must bereviewed in order to shorten it and make it morefocused.I now turn to the Commission on Human Rights.No country or group has a monopoly on selectivity. Weare all good practitioners  focusing our attention onissues that are often remote from our shores or that donot collide with friendships  alliances or interests.Timor-Leste fully endorses the establishment of aHuman Rights Council and is prepared to serve in sucha body if we are asked to do so.Timor-Leste strongly supports the creation of aPeacebuilding Commission  which will play a criticalrole in post-conflict situations. The merits are suigeneris. In view of our unique and rich experience Timor-Leste would be pleased to serve on that newbody if our friends believe we can be useful there.There is agreement that the Economic and SocialCouncil must be reformed. It seems to duplicate or addlittle value to its subsidiary bodies. We do not supportexpanding the Council’s mandate to include managingUnited Nations post-conflict activities.27A permanent member of the Security Councilshould not limit its peacekeeping contributions toeloquent rhetoric while refraining from providing thetroops necessary to back up its words. We are allcapable of delivering eloquent speeches with apparentmoral force  but we do not all have the same politicalwill  courage or raw power to match our words.Aspiring Security Council members  permanent andnon-permanent alike  should be countries with stable andopen political systems and with effective credible nationalleaderships that inspire trust and respect in theirrespective regions and throughout the world as a whole.My Government holds the view that regionalbalance remains a sine-qua-non principle as shouldrepresentation of civilizations. Asia  which containshalf of the world’s population  is grosslyunderrepresented in the United Nations system and willremain so  even with the possible addition of India andJapan. Timor-Leste supports the G-4 initiative  becausewe believe that the four countries concerned fulfilevery reasonable qualifying criterion for permanentmembership in the Security Council.Timor-Leste  which has an overwhelminglyCatholic majority population  is proud to have been thefirst country to draw the attention of this body to theneed to insure that the Muslim world be adequatelyrepresented in an expanded Security Council. Wecontinue to believe that Indonesia  the world’s largestMuslim country  with the third largest population inour region and the third largest Asian democracy  isuniquely suited for permanent member status.I wish now to touch on an issue that has beenvery much in the news in the last few months: Japanand its neighbours. Timor-Leste understands thereservations of certain countries that do not wish to seetoo large a Security Council; we understand thereluctance of some of the current permanent five toabandon or share privileges with new ones. Weunderstand that countries that were invaded andcolonized by Japan during the Second World War arenot receptive to their former aggressor. Timor-Leste too  was occupied by Japan during the Second WorldWar. But we also remember how the proud Japanesepeople were made to pay an extraordinary price fortheir Second World War sins. Hiroshima stands as theliving reminder of that horrible price.Japanese leaders were brought to trial at theInternational Military Tribunal for the Far East andpaid for their crimes. A defeated Japan was effectivelyoccupied and administered by the victorious AmericanPower. This benign occupier charted the course of thenew Japan  which today is a world economic Power  apeaceful and vibrant democracy that has madeenormous contributions to the well-being of developingcountries and the United Nations system.Allow me now to share with the Assembly myGovernment’s concern on some key internationalissues — the Middle East  Afghanistan and Iraq.First  we commend Israeli Prime Minister ArielSharon for his courage in disengaging from Gaza. Wehope that this is only a first step towards the fullimplementation of the road map leading to theestablishment of a democratic Palestinian State. Thenew Palestinian leaders and people deserve equalpraise for their moderation and statesmanship  patienceand tolerance.In Iraq and Afghanistan  local extremist elementsand foreign mercenaries continue their campaign ofterror to reverse the democratic gains made by thepeople of the two countries. The internationalcommunity and  in particular  the neighbouringcountries  have a special duty to provide all necessarysupport to the brave peoples of Afghanistan and Iraq intheir struggle to consolidate their hard-won freedoms;the neighbouring countries must do more to preventtheir territories from being used as springboards for theinfiltration of mercenaries and weapons intoAfghanistan and Iraq."
"164",6876,"TON",60,2005,"May I first take thisopportunity to congratulate the President on hiselection to lead the work of the General Assembly. Letme also reassure him of Tonga’s support and fullconfidence that the sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly will be fruitful and successful under his veryable leadership.I would also like to give due recognition to thesterling work of his predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation ofGabon  during the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly.I also join others in commending Secretary-General Kofi Anan for his leadership of ourOrganization.As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of ourOrganization  we can pause and reflect on where weare  and on the basis of our experience in the past andthe opportunities available for us in the future. We canchart a roadmap that will ensure that we  the MemberStates  deliver on our commitments to the purposes andprinciples of the Charter and international law  whichare indispensable foundations of a more peaceful prosperous and just world. Tonga shares the concernsvoiced by several other delegations that businesscannot proceed as usual  as this will continue to affectthe role and relevancy of our Organization and theimportant place of multilateralism in accomplishing itsaims.The Secretary-General’s High-level Panel onThreats  Challenges and Change delivered thelandmark report expected of it. The Panel’s far-reaching findings and recommendations laid a firmfoundation for what our Foreign Minister described lastyear as “constructive engagement”. Tonga remainsoptimistic that the level and intensity of engagementamong Member States can still produce a lastinglegacy of improvement and the necessary changes forour Organization and its important work.Last Friday  at the conclusion of the historicHigh-level Plenary Meeting  heads of State andGovernment adopted the outcome document  whichprovides multilateral solutions to the problems indevelopment  peace and collective security  humanrights  the rule of law and the strengthening of theUnited Nations. The baton has now been passed on tous to begin the implementation phase of the summit’soutcome  and we need to rise to the challenge to makegood on our promises.The development agenda remains the first priorityfor small island developing countries  including Tonga.Over three decades  we have accumulated experiencein national and integrated regional developmentplanning and have  therefore  fully embraced ourprimary responsibility for our own development. Theachievement of the Millennium Development Goalshas been incorporated into our wider developmentefforts.The financing of these development programmes however  continues to depend on bilateral andmultilateral official development assistance (ODA)  aswell as on concessionary loans from regional andglobal financial institutions.In this regard  we welcome the proposedincreased resources that will become available as aresult of the establishment of timetables by manydeveloped countries to achieve the target of 0.7 percent of gross national product (GNP) for ODA by2015. We congratulate those countries that havealready fulfilled their commitment in meeting therequired target. The recent efforts and initiatives toenhance the quality of aid and to increase its impact including the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness are also welcome steps.ODA  while necessary  will be insufficient on itsown and would have to be complemented by activepromotion of foreign direct investment  improvingtrade access and effective development partnerships.The outcome document emphasizes that one ofthe critical challenges to economic growth is to ensurethat the necessary internal conditions are put in placefor mobilizing domestic savings. Tonga embarked on apublic sector and economic reform programme in 2002.To date  several important pieces of legislation havebeen enacted through the Legislative Assembly including the Public Finance Act of 2002  to modernizethe way the Government manages its finances and toprovide for more transparency; the Public Service Actof 2002  to modernize employment and remunerationmethods; and the Public Enterprise Act of 2002 toprovide for increased accountability by publicenterprises. A programme of reform of Tonga’s system29of taxation is also under way to bring it into conformitywith international norms and bilateral and multilateralobligations.Tonga welcomes the recognition in the outcomedocument of the special needs and vulnerabilities ofsmall island developing States and the commitment toaddress those needs and vulnerabilities through full andeffective implementation of the Mauritius Strategyadopted by the International Meeting to Review theImplementation of the Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates and the Barbados Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates.Energy continues to play a crucial role in Tonga’ssustainable development strategies  and maintaining afine balance between energy  the environment and theeconomy is a national priority. Tonga’s increasingreliance on imported petroleum products to satisfy itsenergy needs means that it is particularly vulnerable toexternal events that affect the price and availability ofpetroleum products. In this regard  Tonga reiterates itsconcern over the continuing escalation of the price ofoil and its negative impact on its economy. Concertedefforts will have to focus on research and developmentfor alternative sources of energy.Tonga recognizes the need to promote genderequality with the implementation of its National Policyon Gender and Development  which was approved in2001.Remittances are a welcome source of foreignexchange  and Tonga is recorded as one the countriesmost dependent on them as they amount to 39 per centof gross domestic product. We therefore acknowledgethe important nexus between international migrationand development and the need to deal with thechallenges and opportunities that migration presents tocountries of origin  destination and transit. We alsolook forward to the General Assembly’s high-leveldialogue on international migration and development to be held in 2006.We join with others who have voiced their regretat the failure of the 2005 Nuclear Non-ProliferationTreaty Review Conference and reiterate the importanceof implementing the three pillars of the Treaty.Tonga supports the call to establish the mandate modalities  functions  size  composition membership working methods and procedures of the new HumanRights Council as soon as possible during the currentsession of the General Assembly.We fully recognize that post-conflict peacebuildingis vital to achieving sustainable peace and support theestablishment of a Peacebuilding Commission by theend of 2005.We strongly condemn terrorism in all its formsand manifestations  committed by whomever  whereverand for whatever purpose  as it constitutes one of themost serious threats to international peace and security.We also look forward to the successful conclusion ofthe comprehensive convention on internationalterrorism during the present session of the Assembly.Tonga continues to support the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and has progressed well indrafting domestic legislation to put into effect all of the12 counter-terrorism conventions to which we haveacceded.We applaud the efforts and proposals for acomprehensive package of reforms to revitalize theGeneral Assembly and to strengthen the Economic andSocial Council  to enable them to fulfil their mandatesas envisaged in the Charter. We also support theongoing work of the Secretary-General to improve theefficiency and effectiveness of the Secretariat.Perhaps one of the more intense engagementsamong our membership involves the reform of theSecurity Council. Tonga maintains its support forJapan’s proper and permanent place on any enhancedCouncil. The emergence  in particular  of prospectivepermanent members and novel ideas on criteria hasmade this issue more deserving of further patience poise and pragmatism. However  momentum andadvances on readily agreeable aspects of our reformagenda should proceed to fruition.The ever-changing landscape of the Middle Eastcontinues to present hopeful signs suggesting that anenduring peace is possible. Genuine gestures  like thatinvolving Gaza  by Israel and the Palestinian Authority offer a platform upon which mutual borders might besecured and upon which statehood might flourish.Regional organizations play an important role insupporting and complementing the interests of membercountries in various fields  and Tonga acknowledgesthe role of the Pacific Island Forum in that regard. At aregional level  Tonga is fully committed to its30obligations in ensuring peace in the region andcontinues to support the Regional Assistance Missionto the Solomon Islands with the third deployment bythe Tonga Defence Services currently in operation inthe Solomon Islands. The Pacific Plan  which wasarticulated by our Pacific Forum leaders for therealization of their vision through deeper and strongerregional cooperation and integration in the areas ofeconomic growth  social development  security andenvironmental protection  will be tabled forconsideration by the leaders in October of this year.Tonga  therefore  welcomes the call for support of astronger relationship between the United Nations andregional organizations.The Kingdom continues to observe a “one-China”policy that recognizes Taiwan as an integral andinalienable part of China. An essential component ofthat policy properly acknowledges that common andmutual issues are ideally left to an across-the-Straitframework dialogue  as opposed to any multilateralformula  however well conceived.Tonga continues to develop and strengthen its“Look East” policy  in particular with China. Earlierthis year  the Kingdom established a diplomaticpresence in Beijing to give strong voice to its interestsand impetus to its exploration and pursuit of mutuallyrelevant and beneficial ventures  including tourism trade  aviation and security.The world is watching us. Let us not renege onour commitments but push forward on the reforms thatare essential to ensuring that multilateralism remainsthe most efficient and effective way to address globalproblems and issues."
"165",6916,"TTO",60,2005,"It is an honourfor me to extend to His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliassonmy sincere congratulations on his election to thepresidency of the sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly. Let me also pay tribute to his predecessor His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping  for his extraordinarydedication and leadership during the fifty-ninthsession. I also wish to express my Governmentíssincere appreciation to the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for his tireless effortsaimed at strengthening multilateralism and upholdingthe purposes and principles of the United Nations.Five years ago  at the Millennium Summit  worldleaders reaffirmed their faith in the United Nations andits Charter as indispensable foundations of a morepeaceful  prosperous and just world. While there hasbeen progress in some areas  much remains to be doneto bring about the full realization of the ambitiousGoals set forth in the Millennium Declaration.The promise of a global partnership to realize theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) remainsunfulfilled for the vast majority of the peoples ofAfrica  Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean  wherea total of more than one billion people still live belowthe poverty line. For the Caribbean region in particularchallenges remain in the area of trade  where theerosion of tariff preferences for primary commoditiessuch as bananas and sugar have been extremelyprejudicial to the socio-economic development ofmany countries of the Caribbean Community(CARICOM).The Caribbean region has also been affected bythe HIV/AIDS pandemic  which has killed over 20million men  women and children worldwide. Theimplicit threat to economic and social stability  humandevelopment and security cannot be underestimated ordenied.The target of devoting 0.7 per cent of grossnational income to official development assistance(ODA) also remains an elusive goal  although therehave been encouraging signs recently  such as thecommitment made by the Group of Eight (G-8) at theGleneagles summit and the commitments of otherdeveloped countries to meet that target by the year2015. Those commitments were reiterated in the 2005outcome document (resolution 60/1) of the High-levelPlenary Meeting.At the same time  we have been increasinglyconfronted by humanitarian emergencies caused bydevastating natural disasters  with the resultant internaldisplacement of people. Once again  we wish toexpress our sympathy to the Government and thepeople of the United States of America in the wake ofHurricane Katrina. In our own CARICOM subregion we remain particularly vulnerable to the devastatingeffects of hurricanes. In the light of the extensivedamage inflicted on the sister island of Grenada lastyear  we urge the United Nations  the internationalcommunity and donor agencies to give priorityattention to the CARICOM subregion in the areas ofdisaster preparedness and post-recovery assistance.The rise of global terrorism  the threat of theproliferation of nuclear  biological and chemicalweapons and the concomitant prospect of them fallinginto the hands of non-State actors have emerged asissues of extreme urgency. The spread of small armsand light weapons - the weapons of choice in manyintra-State conflicts - also poses a threat to thesecurity of many countries. In that regard  CARICOMis particularly concerned about the increasingincidence of violent crime caused by the presence ofillegal firearms and their association with the illicitdrug trade.The confluence of all those interconnected threatsand challenges  as daunting as this may seem  can andmust be countered and effectively addressed. We musttherefore demonstrate the political will and thecommitment to act collectively to develop national andregional strategies with renewed resolve at the globallevel to support robust multilateralism  with a strongand effective United Nations at its centre. No oneState  no matter how powerful  can act wholly by itselfto resolve those common problems. There is alsosimply no legitimate alternative to the UnitedNations ó no comparable multilateral institutionwhere all member States meet  deliberate  advance andharmonize their views and interests and negotiate andadopt instruments for collective action to the benefit ofall.Last week  in adopting the outcome document we agreed to a road map  as it were  of measuresrequired to reorient the United Nations to meet todayíschallenges. Even as we reaffirm our faith in the UnitedNations and our commitment to more robustmultilateralism  and even as we work towards a moreeffective United Nations through the implementation of8the outcome document  we must recall that the mainpurpose of last weekís Meeting was to review theprogress made since the Millennium Summit adoptedthe MDGs  five years ago. Indeed  it is the overallimprovement in the lives of all our peoples  in whosename we are gathered here  by which history willultimately judge or condemn us. Permit me  therefore to offer some views on issues that Trinidad and Tobagoconsiders paramount  and on the principles that shouldserve as a guide for our future deliberations.Those must of necessity include the following:the imperative of recommitting ourselves  as a matterof priority  to the full realization of the developmentgoals and objectives that have emerged from majorUnited Nations conferences and summits  including theMDGs; greater democratization of all United Nationsorgans and related bodies  in terms of both theircomposition and their mode of operations; strictobservance of the rule of international law and justice;and respect for the commonly shared values on whichthe United Nations is founded.Development must remain central to the agendaof the United Nations.Trinidad and Tobago supports the increasedattention of the international community towardsAfrica in overcoming its developmental challenges andin providing that continent with the increased resourcesneeded to enable it to fully implement the NewPartnership for Africaís Development (NEPAD).We welcome in particular the commitmentcontained in the outcome document to theimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Actionfor the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States. We call for the full and effectiveimplementation of the commitments  programmes andtargets contained in the Mauritius Strategy  adopted atthe International Meeting to Review theImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Actionfor the Sustainable Development of Small IslandStates.Trinidad and Tobago has demonstratedremarkable strength and resilience in the face of aglobal environment characterized by rapid economic social and other changes. We have embarked on theroad to developed-nation status and hope to reach ourgoal by the year 2020 or earlier.Our Vision 20/20 includes the evolution of atechnologically driven  knowledge-based society  ahighly productive and globally competitive economy and the provision of a standard of living comparable tothat of the developed world. To achieve that vision  theGovernment of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago isdeveloping its human capital by creating a virtuallyseamless educational system from the primary to thetertiary level  with increasing emphasis on informationtechnology and other related subjects. In this way wewill ensure that our young people can become anintegral part of the global labour force  with thenecessary skills to compete locally  regionally andinternationally.Our development agenda is not centred solely onthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is  as myPrime Minister stated from this very rostrum one yearago  ""part and parcel of a pan-Caribbean agenda towhich we are irrevocably and solidly committed -[and in which the] development of Trinidad andTobago and CARICOM are intertwined"". (A/59/PV.10 p. 8)We therefore remain committed to the integrationof the Caribbean region through the instrumentality ofCARICOM. To that end  Trinidad and Tobago hasprovided substantial financial and economic assistanceto our CARICOM neighbours through a variety ofmechanisms  including capital market activities  directforeign investment  debt relief and direct bilateralassistance. We have also provided extensive hurricanerelief as well as assistance to the private sector inCARICOM to strengthen their export capability.As an energy surplus country  Trinidad andTobago has  through its own Petroleum StabilizationFund  made financial assistance available toCARICOM countries to the tune of some $48 millionper annum ó and this without any conditionalities.No development or security assessment in oursubregion would be complete without consideration ofthe grave political  economic  social and security crisisthat confronts the Haitian people. We look forward tothe holding of free  fair  democratic and inclusiveelections in Haiti and to the installation of a trulydemocratically elected Government in that nation  sothat Haiti can once again sit in the Council ofCARICOM.Trinidad and Tobago and other CARICOM Statesremain committed over the long term to securing the9progress and future of the Haitian people. We thereforeurge the United Nations system and the internationaldonor community to provide the necessary support toHaiti in the post-election period. Effective assistance the disbursement of funds pledged and the release ofother resources will ensure the progress of a nationcurrently overwhelmed by daunting challenges.In the area of disarmament  we share thedisappointment of many Member States at our failureto demonstrate the necessary political will to ensure theconsensus adoption of agreements leading to tangibleand substantive results at the Review Conference of theParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) and in the outcome document.Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its condemnationof terrorism in all its forms and manifestations  and itis committed to doing its part to eradicate that scourgefrom our world. In that vein  we look forward to theearly conclusion of a draft comprehensive conventionon international terrorism.In addition  we welcome the action taken bymembers of the international community to combatterrorism  but we would wish to reiterate that thehuman rights and the civil and political rights ofindividuals must be respected in the course of anycounter-terrorism actions taken by Member States ofthe international community.As a small island developing State  we facedifficulties associated with the evils of the drug tradeand the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.As a result  it is becoming increasingly difficult to stemthe tide of criminal activity within our society.Trinidad and Tobago believes that aninternational order based on the rule of law must beobserved in relations between and among States. Thisfundamental pillar is indispensable for the properfunctioning of the international system. In theirrelations  States must have regard  at all times  for theprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and ofinternational law.We reaffirm in particular those principles relatingto the sovereign equality of all States Members of theUnited Nations  non-interference in the internal affairsof Members  respect for their political and territorialintegrity  the right of peoples to self-determination  andrecourse to peaceful means for the settlement ofdisputes.We also reaffirm the important role of theGeneral Assembly in the development of internationaltreaties.Trinidad and Tobago expresses its deep regret atthe failure of the outcome document to include anyreference to the International Criminal Court or thequestion of impunity. In that regard  we call on allStates Members of the United Nations to becomeparties to the Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court in order to ensure that it becomes atruly global instrument for the trial of those accused ofcommitting crimes that affront the conscience of allhumanity.My country welcomes the cooperation betweenthe International Criminal Court and the UnitedNations  which was highlighted earlier this year whenthe Security Council decided to refer the situation inDarfur to the Court. We look forward to increasedopportunities for collaboration and cooperationbetween these two important global institutions inputting an end to such crimes and to the culture ofimpunity that has for so long accompanied them.Trinidad and Tobago reaffirms its commitment tothe reform and strengthening of the United Nations. Weshare the view that the reform of the United Nationsmust seek to reinforce and consolidate the democraticfoundation upon which this Organization was built.We are of the view that cardinal to the reformagenda must be the revitalization and restoration of therole and authority of the General Assembly  as thechief deliberative  policymaking and representativeorgan of the United Nations.Trinidad and Tobago supports the comprehensivereform of the Security Council. In that regard  we wishto underline the importance of the adoption by theinternational community of a comprehensive set ofreform measures. It is imperative that expansion shouldproceed on the basis of making the Council morerepresentative of the general membership of the UnitedNations. It should contribute to a greaterdemocratization of its functioning. It should impartgreater legitimacy and transparency to its decisions and it should be achieved through the broadest possibleconsultation.Trinidad and Tobago also looks forward toparticipating in discussions on reform of the United10Nations human rights machinery and on the pendingissues relating to the Peacebuilding Commission.Trinidad and Tobago commends the Secretary-General for his ongoing efforts to enhance the effectivemanagement of the United Nations. An efficient effective  well-resourced Secretariat which isaccountable to the General Assembly is indispensableto achieving the objectives of a strengthenedOrganization.Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the Secretariatand management reform proposals contained in theoutcome document as a first step towards a necessarythorough debate and discussion  and we look forwardto participating actively in these negotiations.It is imperative  however  that these proposalsmeet the test of viability  that they have the sanction ofthe established intergovernmental process and that theydo not individually or collectively seek to derogate diminish or further marginalize the role of the GeneralAssembly.As we embark on the path of implementation ofthe outcome document  we must spare no effort toensure that the future of the United Nations is notcompromised by the exigencies of the moment.Institutional renewal  a strengthened United Nationsand a robust multilateralism must allow us to forge atruly effective global response and commitment to thecommon threats and challenges that confront us.Trinidad and Tobago pledges to do its part tomake the United Nations a more effective instrument inthe common service of all our peoples."
"166",6963,"TUN",60,2005,"It ismy distinct pleasure to express to you and to yourfriendly country  the Kingdom of Sweden  my mostsincere congratulations on your election to thepresidency at this sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly and to wish you every success in yourmission.I also express to your predecessor Mr. Jean Ping my deep appreciation for his excellent management ofthe proceedings of the previous session.Allow me to take this opportunity to convey mythanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General commending his diligent efforts in assisting theOrganization to play its role and achieve its nobleobjectives of maintaining peace and security andfurthering development in the world.Tunisia  which celebrates  along with othermembers of the international community the sixtiethanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations reiterates its constant commitment to the nobleprinciples of the Charter and reaffirms itsdetermination to continue to contribute  so that theOrganization may be as effective as possible.Our world today is witnessing rapid andsuccessive developments  often marked by an increaseof tensions and the widening of the development gapbetween the North and the South. This requires that weintensify our consultations and coordination on thequestion of reforming the United Nations anddeveloping its institutions  in accordance with acomprehensive vision based on enhancing solidarity mutual assistance and partnership among peoples sothat our Organization will be able to deal with currentinternational issues efficiently.Many of those issues still constitute a source ofconcern for the international community  because oftheir impact on security and stability  and foremostamong them is the Middle East problem.In keeping with its commitment  and that of itsPresident  His Excellency President Zine El AbidineBen Ali  to peace as a strategic choice  Tunisia hascontributed to all efforts and initiatives aimed atreaching a just  comprehensive and durable settlementto the Palestinian question. We reiterate our call to allparties  more particularly to the Quartet  to takeadvantage of recent positive developments in theregion in order to resume peace negotiations  thusallowing the Palestinian people to recover theirlegitimate national rights and establish their own20independent State on their land as well as bringingsecurity  stability and prosperity to all peoples of theregion.We feel that achieving just  comprehensive anddurable peace in the Middle East requires the recoveryby sisterly Syria and Lebanon of all their occupiedterritories.We also express the hope that sisterly Iraq willcomplete its political process and strengthen itsconstitutional institutions in accordance with theaspirations of the Iraqi people  within a context ofsecurity  stability and national unity.Tunisia welcomes the important steps taken by theSudanese Government towards national reconciliation in keeping with the aspirations of the Sudanese peopleto the consolidation of security and stability in thatcountry.Tunisia is sparing no effort  along with the othersisterly Arab countries  in laying the foundations for anew phase of joint Arab action  promoting cooperationin all the political  economic and cultural fields  andreinforcing the process of development andmodernization  in line with the proposals made anddecisions taken by the Arab Summit in May 2004 which Tunisia had the honour to host.We are also keen on consolidating the bonds offraternity and cooperation with all fellow ArabMaghreb countries and completing the process ofbuilding the Arab Maghreb Union  thus meeting theaspirations of the peoples of the Maghreb todevelopment and complementarity.Although it has witnessed a number of positivedevelopments  the African continent continues to sufferfrom the persistence of tensions and conflicts in manyof its regions. Additional efforts are required in orderto take further steps towards their settlement. Bringingto completion the establishment of the basic structuresof the African Union would enable African countries tomove ahead in promoting cooperation and reinforcingthe foundations of security and stability in thecontinent. This  in turn  will encourage development inAfrican countries and facilitate their integration intothe world economy.At the Euro-Mediterranean level  Tunisia isentering a new phase in its relations with the EuropeanUnion  a phase marked by a determination to furtherpromote  develop and enlarge the scope of partnershipwith that Union on the basis of cooperation  solidarity complementarity and mutual respect  in line with thepurposes and principles adopted at the BarcelonaConference as we prepare to celebrate the tenthanniversary of its Declaration.Tunisia is also endeavouring to strengthen ties offriendship and enlarge the scope of cooperation withthe countries of the American and Asian continents inorder to establish a solidarity-based partnership thatwill lay the foundations for a new stage in theserelations. That would serve the interests of all parties bring their peoples closer to one another and contributeto consolidating the foundations of stability  peace andprosperity in the world.The intensification of violence and terrorism despite the joint efforts undertaken for many years toconfront that grave scourge  deepens our convictionthat the most effective way to deal with terrorism is byunifying our methods for tackling it  therebystrengthening the capacity of the internationalcommunity to confront terrorism and eradicate its rootcauses.In that regard  His Excellency President Zine ElAbidine Ben Ali proposed the convening of aninternational conference under United Nations auspicesaimed at establishing a binding international code ofconduct on combating terrorism.Proceeding from its steadfast adherence to theprinciples of solidarity and dialogue among peoplesand its continuing endeavours to strengthen stabilityand development in the world  Tunisia will take anactive role in achieving the objectives spelled out inthe Millennium Declaration and in finding appropriatesolutions to the international issues we face today.In that regard  we would mention the GeneralAssembly’s adoption of the Tunisian proposal for theestablishment of a World Solidarity Fund. Theinternational community must now provide thenecessary financial resources so that the Fund canlaunch its activities and achieve its noble objectives ofreducing poverty and famine  particularly in someregions of Africa.Tunisia calls for the strengthening of worldsolidarity  the benefits of which were most recentlymanifested in the international efforts to alleviate theenormous damage caused by both the tsunami disasterand hurricane Katrina.21As we prepare to host the second phase of theWorld Summit on the Information Society — held inresponse to a Tunisian proposal dating back to 1998 —Tunisia is looking forward to the high-levelinternational participation of Governments  the privatesector and civil society in that important global eventin order to give it the best possible chance of success.A successful outcome will help to establish asolidarity-based digital culture that allows developingcountries to benefit from the vast prospects offered byinformation and communication technologies and tomake the best use of them in their development plans.Furthermore  Tunisia wishes to express its thanksand appreciation to all Member States and to theinternational and regional organizations that havecontributed to the success of its international initiativeto proclaim 2005 the International Year of Sport andPhysical Education in the service of peace  security anddevelopment in the world.Tunisia will continue to make an effectivecontribution to strengthening the culture of dialogueand the values of tolerance and cultural communicationamong civilizations and among all the world’scountries and peoples  and to work against fanaticismand isolationism. We once again underline theimportance of those values in spreading security  peaceand stability throughout the world  thus freeinghumanity to direct its efforts towards comprehensiveand sustainable development in a spirit of optimismand confidence in a better future."
"167",7010,"TUR",60,2005,"At the outset  I would like toconvey the condolences of my people to the friendlypeople of the United States on the tragic loss of lifeand large-scale destruction caused by HurricaneKatrina. This is also a stark reminder of the many othernatural and man-made disasters  such as famine inAfrica  tsunamis  earthquakes  ecological catastrophesand wide-scale violence and terrorism. They all requiresustained international attention and cooperation.Having suffered from similar disasters  Turkey deeplyfeels for others and stands in solidarity with them.Upholding the principles of justice  dignity equality and social progress for the men and women ofour world should be the basis of the international order.We must spread justice together with freedom. Wecannot rest until we provide prosperity and dignity forevery human being. Those principles should guide usin our future efforts.We have left a very busy period behind culminating with an important summit. The SummitOutcome document (resolution 60/1) has encouragedus all to focus on the global problems we face and onthe way to achieve positive change. Now is the time toact. We must start implementing what we have agreedupon on issues ranging from peacebuilding to humanrights. While doing this  we must not lose sight of ourmain target: we must reach the internationally agreeddevelopment goals  including the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  by the year 2015.With these things in mind  we welcome theSecretary-General’s proposal to start with anaccountability pact (see ). We also welcomeyour idea  Mr. President  to submit an outline of workfor the year ahead related to follow-up of the summit.A large number of international problems that arehigh on the United Nations agenda are occurring in ourpart of the world. These are real issues that closelyaffect the daily lives of our people. As a country with a2rich heritage and great international experience  we areworking to build a culture of compromise andreconciliation.Our historical and cultural links to nations inneighbouring regions from Eurasia to the Islamic worldand our role as a member of European  trans-Atlanticand Mediterranean institutions will have a positiveeffect on Turkey’s contribution to internationalrelations in the twenty-first century.It is against that background  and with a sense ofconfidence  that I take the opportunity to submit to theAssembly’s attention Turkey’s candidacy for anon-permanent seat on the Security Council for theterm 2009-2010.Ongoing reform efforts hold great promise for theimprovement of the political  social and economicstandards of the Middle East region. We will continueto encourage and assist those local efforts.Concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict  the Israeliwithdrawal from the Gaza Strip is an encouragingdevelopment. We would like to witness the samepositive trend in the West Bank. Israeli settlementactivities in occupied territories must come to an end.The sanctity of the holy sites in Jerusalem must berespected. The road map should be revived and fullyimplemented.Furthermore  we must not let terror and violencederail the process this time. The reform of thePalestinian National Authority must move forward particularly in the security domain. Efforts to improvethe living conditions of the Palestinians have to beintensified. We support the work of Mr. JamesWolfensohn  Quartet Special Envoy forDisengagement  and are cooperating with him. Webelieve these efforts will help restore a sense of hopeamong the Palestinians and ensure security for theIsraelis.In order to integrate the Palestinians with theworld  seaports and airports must be built andactivated. Border crossings and trade corridors mustfunction smoothly. Freedom of movement must beachieved. Such measures will go a long way towardsrevitalizing the Palestinian economy. That willencourage the Palestinians to become real partners inpeace with the Israelis. Turkey is already activelyworking with the parties for the realization of thisvision. We are determined to continue to contribute inany way we can.Iraq’s destiny and the way the events areunfolding in that country are of crucial importance forpeace and stability in the Middle East and beyond.Building a democratic and prosperous Iraq at peacewith itself and its neighbours will be possible only ifthe Iraqi people act as one  in full solidarity and with aclear vision. Ethnic and religious differences in Iraqshould not be divisive. Rather they should be a sourceof cultural plurality. Otherwise  the new Iraq will be asource of instability and conflict  instead of hope andinspiration for the entire region.Turkey  in cooperation with the United Nations has been in the forefront of efforts for political andeconomic rehabilitation in Iraq. The Neighbours ofIraq forum  again pioneered by Turkey  has been anefficient platform to support the unity and territorialintegrity of Iraq.The security situation is a source of concern forall. Iraq has  unfortunately  become a training groundfor terrorists. As a neighbouring country  Turkeysuffers as a result of this. We are concerned thatterrorism emanating from Iraq might have a rippleeffect on other countries  including Turkey. It is ourjoint duty to prevent such an outcome.The problems of Nagorny Karabakh  Abkhaziaand South Ossetia continue to impede peace andcooperation in the South Caucusus. These problemsdefy all United Nations principles. They demand oururgent attention. In particular  a peaceful settlementmust be found to the Nagorny Karabakh issueconsistent with the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.Steps towards ending the occupation of Azeri territorywill create a better climate in the region  including inTurkish-Armenian relations. We are giving full supportto the efforts of the Minsk Group. We are closelyfollowing the high-level contacts between Turkey’stwo neighbours and are encouraging the parties tomake progress.In Afghanistan  many challenges still lie ahead.The continued support of the international communityis still needed. Among other matters  education  health gender equality and economic development needincreased attention. Alternative crops must beencouraged in order to replace widespread poppycultivation. As a country that has twice led theInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan 3for a total of 14 months during the past three years Turkey wishes to reiterate its continued commitment.We welcome the holding of elections as an encouragingdevelopment for democracy in Afghanistan.We are determined to continue our support for thestrengthening of peace  stability and prosperity inSouth-East Europe. The Balkan region has madeconsiderable progress towards the establishment of apeaceful environment leading to economicdevelopment. The political and economic consolidationof Bosnia and Herzegovina and final-status talks inKosovo need to be monitored carefully. Turkey willcontinue to be a reliable partner in this process.Regarding the Eastern Mediterranean  our visionis to create a basin of cooperation  stability andprosperity among Turkey  Greece and the two peoplesof Cyprus. However  it is regrettable that  at a timewhen we are debating the best way to reform theUnited Nations and enhance its role  we are at the sametime witnessing an attempt to move the Cyprusproblem away from this Organization. We regard theseefforts to undermine the role of the United Nations as amost disturbing paradox. The Annan plan represented aunique basis for the solution of this problem. Althoughit did not fully meet their expectations  for the sake ofcompromise the Turkish Cypriots approved the plan byan overwhelming majority.On the other hand  under the effective guidanceof the Greek Cypriot leadership  the rejection of theAnnan plan in a referendum held last year was a blowto the international community. Thus  a chance to putan end to the division of the island once and for all wasmissed.The report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/437)issued after the referendum gave an overview of thelong negotiating process and recommended the liftingof all restrictions upon the Turkish Cypriots.Unfortunately  against established practice  thecomprehensive report of the Secretary-General onCyprus is being disregarded. As a result  the unfairrestrictions imposed upon the Turkish Cypriots couldnot be lifted. One might find it difficult to believe thatthe Turkish Cypriots still continue to live underrestrictions  cut off from the outside world.During the ensuing period  the Secretary-General’s soundings and his efforts to reactivate thetalks based on his plan have yielded no tangible resultsbecause of the continued intransigence of the GreekCypriot administration. As if that were not enough  theGreek Cypriot administration is now trying to sidelinethe United Nations and carry this issue to other forums.I urge all international actors to discourage thesemisguided efforts. Turkey continues to be ready tocontribute to United Nations endeavours to find a just equitable and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem onthe basis of the Annan plan.On this occasion  I would like to reiterate theproposal that I made on 30 May 2005 for the lifting ofall restrictions related to the island (see A/59/820). Inthat proposal  I basically suggested that it wasnecessary to enable the free movement of people goods and services and to lift all restrictions applied toseaports and airports between the two sides in Cyprusas well as to Turkey and Greece. It is evident that thisproposal conforms to the legitimate expectations of theinternational community.We attach great importance to furthering ourrelations and cooperation with the African continent.According to an action plan  Turkey is vigorouslydeveloping its relations with Africa as a whole. Werecently opened an office in Addis Ababa to serve as acoordination centre for Turkish humanitarian anddevelopmental assistance to the continent. The TurkishGovernment has also declared 2005 as the Year ofAfrica in Turkey. We will continue our contributions tointernational institutions  working to alleviate thesuffering and eliminate disease and hunger in Africa.The chain of attacks in various parts of the worldproves that no country is immune to terrorism. Wecondemn these atrocities in the strongest terms. Nodistinction should be made among terroristorganizations. There is no room for double standards inthis fight. We must reject terrorism as a method regardless of where  why and how it is employed.Combating terrorism should be a global and collectiveeffort  and the United Nations should continue to playa prominent role. We welcome Security Councilresolutions that call for strengthened measures againstincitement of terrorist acts and in favour of theprevention of armed conflict  particularly in Africa. Wemust also resist any temptation to associate anyspecific culture  religion or faith with terrorism.We should keep in mind that the right to thepeaceful uses of nuclear energy requires full andtransparent cooperation with the International AtomicEnergy Agency. The establishment of zones free of4weapons of mass destruction  particularly in theMiddle East  will be an important contribution tointernational peace and security.Strengthening multilateralism and the central roleof the United Nations in the international system is afundamental aspect of our foreign policy. It is thestrongest hope and guarantee for a safer and betterworld."
"168",7026,"TUV",60,2005,"The people of Tuvalu  onwhose behalf I have the honour to speak  join me inextending our warmest congratulations to the UnitedNations on the occasion of its sixtieth anniversary.I wish to put on record our profound gratitude toevery single member of this great body for theimmense achievements of the United Nations. TheOrganization’s noble values and principles have indeedensured that even small and isolated nations such asTuvalu can enjoy the goals of self-determination andstatehood with dignity and hope. We are proud to be amember of this great family of Nations.We also wish to join others in congratulating you Sir  on your election to the presidency  and to assureyou of our full support and cooperation.Last week the world — our families and ourchildren — heard from us that the time for statingprinciples and defining problems and actions on thecomplex challenges of development  security andhuman rights has long passed. It is now time to takeaction. But how the rhetoric gets translated into actionsto improve standards of living for each nation  and forour families  for women and children in ourcommunities and villages  in an equitable and fairmanner  is now the main challenge. The United Nationsmust play the central role in managing that process.Tuvalu is greatly encouraged by the prevailinggoodwill to fulfil the many international developmenttargets. The commitments made  by the EuropeanUnion and others  to meet the United Nations target of0.7 per cent of gross national product for officialdevelopment assistance is very welcome. We alsowelcome new and innovative initiatives on financingand good governance  including the global DemocracyFund  the French initiative and others. Thecommitment of the United States of America to itsMillennium Challenge Account initiative is also verywelcome.As a small island developing State and a leastdeveloped country which has consistently taken aprudent and responsible approach to its own nationaldevelopment  Tuvalu is very encouraged  in particular by the renewed recognition by the internationalcommunity of the special vulnerabilities of small islanddeveloping States  of the needs of least developedcountries and of the imperative to address them.Increased international cooperation to ensure thefull and effective implementation of the MauritiusStrategy for small island developing States and theBrussels Programme of Action  particularly withregard to the provision of adequate financing  capacity-building and technology development and transfer  iscritical to supporting the poverty reduction andsustainable development efforts of the least developedcountries and small island developing States likeTuvalu. There is now a clear need to establish clearvessels of connectivity from internationalcommitments to national strategies  plans and actionson the ground.In this regard  I am pleased to announce thelaunch  last Friday here in New York  of Te Kakeega II —Tuvalu’s national sustainable development strategiesfor 2005-2015 — a commitment to action by the10Government and all stakeholders  including non-governmental organizations and island communities.We sincerely appreciate the support of our friendsin New York  bilateral partners and United Nationsagencies  and we look forward to working closely withthe international community in advancing appropriatepartnerships as a result of those strategies. In the samevein  the important role played by regional bodies especially those in the Pacific region  such as theCouncil of Regional Organizations for the Pacific  insupporting national efforts ought to be givenrecognition and support. We therefore strongly supportthe remarks by Samoa and Papua New Guinea on theimportance of regional arrangements  such as thePacific Plan.Security challenges continue to create worldwidehavoc  fear and uncertainty. Terrorist acts the worldover  including the recent bombings in London andelsewhere have proven the continued existence offorces bent on undermining the United Nationsfounding goals of freedom  peace and security. Theyhave also underscored the urgency with which we  theUnited Nations  must collectively combat these forces.Tuvalu is fully committed to joining the fightagainst international terrorism  as required by SecurityCouncil resolutions. But we would need to seek theassistance of the United Nations and the internationalcommunity to help us fulfil the requirements particularly on reporting  of these resolutions and ofthe international anti-terrorism conventions.The threat of the impact of climate change  sealevel rise and variability on the entire globalenvironment continues to be a matter of serioussecurity concern to all. For small island and low-lyingcoastal countries like Tuvalu the situation isdevastating  threatening lives  human rights and ourlong-term survival. The impacts are real and alreadyhappening. They demand urgent actions by theinternational community. As correctly underscored bythe Secretary-General in his report  “In largerfreedom”  “Without action  [small island developingStates] will pay a bitter price for the actions of others”(A/59/2005  para. 60). There cannot be a more trueassertion.While we are all deeply touched by the humanloss and destruction suffered from Hurricane Katrinaon the Gulf Coast of the United States of America threeweeks ago  the world will be better advised to takesuch timely warnings seriously. Tuvalu stronglybelieves we must urgently address adaptation andmitigation actions against climate change in line withthe objectives of the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocoltargets to reduce greenhouse gases and advance thedevelopment and use of renewable sources of energy.On the latter subject  it would be remiss ofTuvalu not to again sincerely acknowledge the cominginto force of the Kyoto Protocol early this year and tourge all industrialized countries who have not done soto ratify it as soon as possible. Not to do so will be tosign on Tuvalu’s death warrant.The time is also ripe to initiate dialogue on amore comprehensive approach for future actionsagainst climate change where all major emitters ofgreenhouse gases will need to participate. The eleventhsession of the Conference of Parties to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change  tobe held at Montreal in November  must advancedecisions on critical issues on future actions againstclimate change.Unless actions are taken seriously  all efforts fordevelopment  security and human rights for those mostvulnerable to the impacts of climate change will beseverely compromised. We appeal to those with thecapacity to do so to have a heart for islands likeTuvalu  as well as for the rest of mankind.On enhancing the relevancy and the role of theUnited Nations  we would like to reiterate our strongsupport for the reforms for the United Nations  inparticular the expansion of the permanent membershipand working methods of the Security Council. In thisvein we also reiterate our support for the considerationof Japan  Germany  India and Brazil for permanentseats on an expanded Council. We strongly feel that themomentum so far achieved on the issue must be takenadvantage of to finally resolve the proposed reforms bythe end of December 2005  at the latest. We alsobelieve more equitable representation of thedeveloping countries for the non-permanent seats ofthe Council is vital and long overdue.Tuvalu recognizes the seriousness of theHIV/AIDS epidemic on the social and economicdevelopment and security of Tuvalu and other Pacificisland countries. Given our exposure and the level ofmobility of our communities  particularly our seafarerswho serve on merchant ships worldwide  there is an11urgent need for assistance from the internationalcommunity  such as that provided under the GlobalFund to Fight HIV/AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria  tohelp us raise awareness in Tuvalu to combat the threatsof the epidemic. We need technical and financialassistance for these efforts.In terms of natural resources  Tuvalu is really abig ocean  small island country. The Pacific Ocean thatsurrounds our islands provides the vital source of ourlivelihoods and economic and social development.Increasingly  however  we are becoming concernedwith the real threats of illegal  unreported andunregulated fishing and of pollution to the oceans fromwaste  particularly from the trans-shipment of highlyradioactive and toxic materials in our region. Wewould need to seek the understanding of theinternational community to help us save our oceans andsupport fully the Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policyadopted in 2002.An important source of financial flows todeveloping countries  particularly also to small islanddeveloping nations such as Tuvalu  is migrant workers’remittances from developed countries. Indeed remittancesfrom our overseas workers  and particularly Tuvaluanseafarers serving abroad  provide a substantive sourceof income so vital for social and economicdevelopment in Tuvalu.Tuvalu fully supports the affording of urgentattention to the issue of migrant workers’ rights including the maintenance of competency oninternational standards and migrant workers’ safety andsecurity  in the international agenda  in order to ensuresustaining this vital source of capital for small islanddeveloping States.An issue of continuing concerns to Tuvalu is thequestion of the representation in the United Nations.Regrettably  this august body cannot be said to beuniversal without the rightful representation of the 23million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan.Tuvalu feels that recognizing the political anddemocratic developments in Taiwan  the active andresponsible participation of Taiwan in world affairs especially in trade  commerce  health  and internationaldevelopment  without representation in the UnitedNations is unjust and morally wrong. This state ofaffairs needs to be corrected. We seek a proper reviewby the United Nations of this important issue  as wellas the escalation of tension in the Taiwan Straitfollowing the enactment by the People’s Republic ofChina of its “anti-secession law”.In conclusion  we want to reiterate that effortsaimed at the sustainable development of small islanddeveloping States like Tuvalu  will be of no meaningunless the issue of climate change and sea level isaddressed decisively  and with urgency. Tuvalu’sinterest is not self serving. The more seriousconsequences of not acting now on climate change  aswe are already witnessing the world over  will be felteverywhere.It is our fervent hope that out of this commonhouse of our United Nations family  there will emergebetter understanding and goodwill for the long lastingsecurity and survival of Tuvalu and the whole world."
"169",7072,"TZA",60,2005,"Onbehalf of the United Republic of Tanzania  Icongratulate the President on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. I wishhim every success. I would also like to extend mydelegation’s gratitude to his predecessor  Mr. JeanPing  for presiding over the Assembly’s fifty-ninthsession  which  among other accomplishments successfully negotiated the outcome document of theHigh-level Plenary Meeting.At the outset  I should like to commendSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his outstanding andtenacious leadership of the United Nations through oneof the most trying interludes in the Organization’shistory. That period has probably been the mostcreative and visionary in the Secretary-General’scareer  as he inspired the Organization and itsmembership to embark upon ambitious and much-needed reforms to make the Organization relevant andequal to the threats and challenges of a globalizingworld in the twenty-first century.The summit that has just ended set the tone agenda and direction for where the United Nationsshould go 60 years after its inception at San Franciscoin 1945. The pace of reform will be determined by thecollective political dedication of us  the Members ofthe Organization. The process of United Nationsreform has brought us together and reaffirmed thesovereign equality of nations and demonstrated theindispensability of collective action and the demandsof shared responsibility and obligations in internationalaffairs. Although what we have agreed upon falls shortof what we set out to accomplish  we have to putdetails into what we need to implement with the samespirit of collective dedication and a sense of commonpurpose. We should not allow political expediency andposturing to rob us of our declared objectives.The glaring indignities of poverty  hunger illiteracy and preventable disease amidst the glamourand opulence of prosperity in some quarters of theworld should be relegated to the dustbin of history.That is achievable if we implement the commitmentsthat we resolved to undertake at the summit that hasjust ended. At Monterrey we agreed on a frameworkfor partnership. For some members of the G-8 Gleneagles transformed a 30-year-old pledge to devote0.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) toofficial development assistance into a timetable; forothers  it resulted in predictable increases. Debt37sustainability has finally given way to debtcancellation for some countries  including my own  theUnited Republic of Tanzania. That is a tremendousrelief and will make a significant quantitative andqualitative difference to our development programmesand priorities.Trade and investment have also receivedacceptance as being central to growth anddevelopment. The Doha trade and development roundof negotiations  to take place in Hong Kong later thisyear  should be completed with agreements on pendingissues such as subsidies.The political capital generated at the summitshould bring about a convergence of resources fromour development partners and the economic  political fiscal and institutional reforms already under way inAfrica  and result in predictable and implementabledevelopment programmes. The issue of absorptivecapacity should not arise when there is coherence andcoordination among our partners within a collaborativeframework at country level to mainstream assistanceinto national development strategies and priorities.The United Republic of Tanzania has alreadycomplied with the critical element of paragraph 22 (a)of the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) which calls upon developing countries to adopt andimplement comprehensive national strategies toachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG).We are ahead in achieving the goal regarding universalprimary education  namely  nine years before the 2015deadline. We are on-course in achieving the goalsregarding access to safe drinking water  reducing childmortality and promoting gender equality in politicalparticipation and decision-making structures. Withsteady assistance and our macroeconomic and politicalstability  we should get closer to achieving most of theGoals by 2015.In sub-Saharan Africa individual countries areaccelerating reforms and improving the climate forinvestment. Frontloading aid flows and innovative newsources of finance to bridge the financial gap inachieving the MDGs should be scaled up  as shouldaid-in-trade to overcome supply side constraints.Subsidies and market-access issues should also beaddressed simultaneously in the internationaldevelopment agenda. The outcome of the Helsinkiprocess  with its wealth of ideas  adds tremendousvalue both to the reform process launched last weekand to the overall international development agenda. Itaddresses political deficits and requirements to bringabout purposeful development and democratic changesin this era of globalization.The relationship between development andsecurity at the national and international levels hasclearly emerged during the debate and negotiations onthe 2005 World Summit Outcome  on which I do notneed to dwell here. The arms race in conventional andnuclear weapons can only bring the world toapocalyptic brinkmanship — by design or by accident.The agonizing endeavour to mobilize developmentefforts to achieve the MDGs stands in stark contrast tothe irony of spending trillions of dollars on armamentsof total and mass destruction. It is therefore mostdisconcerting that the summit was unable to come upwith an agreement on disarmament and non-proliferation. We should not give up on the subject ofdisarmament and non-proliferation. Let us thereforemake another effort to resume negotiations on thoseissues.We in Tanzania and in our region are alsoparticularly keen to see a global convention concludedsoon to regulate the marking and tracing of all smallarms and light weapons and on the illicit brokering ofarms which fuel violent conflicts and instability in ourregions in Africa.Collective security cannot be enhanced withoutreform of the Security Council. The reform of theSecurity Council too has been deferred  but the issue ofthe Council’s expansion and the reform of its workingmethods should remain on the agenda. Negotiations onthe issue should resume soon. The United Republic ofTanzania supports the Ezulwini consensus on thereform of the Security Council  bearing in mind thatonly Africa has yet to have either a permanent seat or aveto in the Council. Our interlocutors should recognizethat imbalance in our negotiations and should try toaccommodate Africa’s demands to make the SecurityCouncil more  not less  representative and more  notless  legitimate.The condemnation of terrorism in all its formsand manifestations brings us closer to an agreeddefinition  which would be helpful in galvanizing ourundivided efforts to combat terrorism. The lack of anagreed definition  however  should not delay anagreement on a comprehensive anti-terrorismconvention in the course of this session of the General38Assembly. As a victim of terrorism in recent years  theUnited Republic of Tanzania has a compelling reasonto support a global anti-terrorist strategy.Respect for the human rights and fundamentalfreedoms of all people is entrenched in the purposesand principles of the Charter of the United Nations andbuttressed by the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. For nearly 60 years  the institutional expressionand status of human rights in the United Nations hasbeen evolving  and it still is. We support theestablishment of the Human Rights Council to theextent that it will elevate the centrality of humanrights  enhance the moral authority and integrity of theUnited Nations  and overcome the shortcomings of thecurrent Commission on Human Rights. The newCouncil should embody the principles and practices ofpeer review in its working methods to avoid doublestandards in accountability and compliance  whichhave plagued the Human Rights Commission.The new concept of the “responsibility to protect”merits our support  after the recent internationalfailures to protect people in Rwanda and Bosnia. Theresponsibility to protect should be a collectiveundertaking by States to protect populations fromgenocide  crimes against humanity and war crimes.However  we will need to establish benchmarks andsafeguards to guarantee against unilateral andpolitically motivated interventions  such as thoseexperienced in the past with what were conceived andpresented as humanitarian intervention.The African continent is the main scene of bothlooming and several ongoing natural and human-madedisasters. Some are forgotten and protracted  whileothers gain initial media attention but receive delayed and often inadequate  responses. We support therecommendations in the outcome document for newstandby arrangements and funding for emergencies inAfrica.There is an international regime in place toprovide protection and assistance to refugees fleeingfor their lives from persecution  violence and grossviolations of human rights. The United Republic ofTanzania has received and protected such victims sincewe became independent  in 1961. Currently  Tanzaniais still hosting over half a million refugees. We aregratified and encouraged by the commitment in theoutcome document to safeguard the institution ofasylum and by its reaffirmation of the principle ofsolidarity and burden-sharing in assisting refugeepopulations and their host communities. We equallyhope that the recognition of the Guiding Principles onInternal Displacement will provide more effectiveprotection for internally displaced persons by relevantand appropriate authorities.The outcome document has duly recognized thetragedy of the HIV/AIDS pandemic  the malaria andthe tuberculosis that have hit Africa so hard. Thatglobal awareness should be matched by adequatefunding to save current and succeeding generationsfrom the ravages of those diseases.Tanzania would like to thank President OlusegunObasanjo of Nigeria for the statement he made  in hiscapacity as Chairman of the African Union  on thesituation relating to conflicts  peace and security inAfrica. We are grateful to him  to other Africanleaders and to the Chairman of the African UnionCommission — His Excellency President AlphaKonare — as well as to all our friends outside Africa for their dedicated efforts to prevent and resolveconflicts in Africa.Last week  the Security Council adopted itsresolution 1625 (2005)  on strengthening theeffectiveness of the Council’s role in conflictprevention  particularly in Africa. Among other things the resolution stresses the importance of avertingconflicts to make possible peaceful development security and stability in Africa. The resolution alsocalls for the strengthening of cooperation andcommunication between the United Nations andregional organizations such as the African Union inmediation efforts and peacekeeping.The bulk of United Nations peacekeepingoperations are in Africa  following peace agreementsthat are at various stages of implementation. Despiteserious numerical  logistical  financial and sometimesimage constraints  multidimensional peacekeepingoperations are making positive contributions torestoring peace in Africa in collaboration with theAfrican Union and other friends of Africa. Political andoperational partnerships between the United Nationsand the African Union need to be strengthened andinstitutionalized.We welcome the implementation of theComprehensive Peace Agreement in the Sudan inpartnership with the United Nations. We encourageprogress in the current peace negotiations on Darfur.39The institutional and operational requirement tobridge the transitional gap from peacekeeping todevelopment  in the form of a PeacebuildingCommission  is one of the main decisions to have beentaken in the current reform of the United Nations.Africa needs the Commission. It should becomeoperational as soon as possible. The peaceful outcomesin Burundi and Somalia — and  soon  in Sierra Leoneand Liberia — require a peacebuilding mechanismduring the transition from peacekeeping toreconstruction and development. The peace processesin both Burundi and Somalia have had tortuous paths but those countries finally have peace agreements andtransitional Governments in place. The PeacebuildingCommission should focus priority attention on bothBurundi and Somalia. The second summit on the GreatLakes region  to be held later this year in Nairobi  willpave the way for a peace and security pact and forpeacebuilding initiatives in the region.The only remaining case of self-determination inAfrica is Western Sahara. We appeal for maximumcooperation by the parties concerned and forunrelenting support for the issue from the internationalcommunity through the Baker plan. It is in the interestof all of us here to reach a peaceful solution to thatproblem.I cannot conclude my statement withoutaddressing the situation in the Middle East  and inparticular the question of Palestine  which remains ofgreat concern to my Government. There have beenpath-breaking developments in the Israeli-Palestinianconflict to revive the road map and invigorate theinitiatives of the Quartet. The new leadership ofMr. Mahmoud Abbas at the Palestinian Authority  thewithdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip and thecoming elections in the occupied territories areinjecting new dynamism and a positive direction intothe peace process. But we must accept the reality thatthe people of Palestine have equal rights  not only tolive in peace and security in full human dignity butalso to establish their own independent State coexisting side by side with the State of Israel. Weshould therefore do all we can to help secure the justand lasting peace that is the right of the Palestinian Israeli and Arab peoples.Finally  I want to reiterate our deepest sympathiesand condolences to the victims  the Government andthe people of the United States of America in the wakeof the death and destruction wreaked by HurricaneKatrina."
"170",7115,"UGA",60,2005,"I should like first of all tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside overthe General Assembly at this important session  atwhich we pledge our full cooperation. I also wish tothank your predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  for havingconducted the proceedings of the fifty-ninth session soefficiently and for having spearheaded the vitalnegotiations on the outcome document adopted by thesummit.I must also express my gratitude to theSecretary-General for his leadership  especially hisefforts to reform the United Nations so as to make itmore responsive to the dynamics and demands of thecurrent world.The founding fathers of the United Nationsdreamed of an organization that would be able  in thewords of the Charter  to promote social progress andbetter standards of life in larger freedom. It was inpursuit of that dream that the General Assembly at itsfifty-fifth session adopted the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). That was a milestone inthe realization of one of the purposes and principles ofthe Charter — to achieve international cooperation insolving international problems of an economic  social cultural or humanitarian character  to promote andencourage respect for human rights and fundamentalfreedoms for all and to be the centre for harmonizingthe actions of nations in attaining those common ends.A great deal has been done since the MillenniumSummit in 2000  at both national and internationallevels  to attain the objectives that we set ourselves inthe MDGs. Asia and Latin America have progressedwell  while Oceania and Africa have not been quite assuccessful. On the whole  Africa’s performance hasshown mixed results. Some regions  especially inNorth Africa  have registered positive achievements while others have faired negatively.In a globalized world  the future and welfare ofall are interlinked. Poverty in one part of the worldthreatens peace and security globally. Equally  anepidemic in a remote village in Africa threatens thehealth of the prosperous individual in New York. Inessence  we all share a common fate. The internationalcommunity has therefore a self-interested obligation tohelp Africa emerge from its current predicament. Letthe wealth of some enhance the welfare of all.Uganda hopes that the World Summit Outcome(resolution 60/1) marks a real commitment to23improving the welfare of the world’s poor and tomaking the United Nations the vanguard for theaspirations of all. We hope that it will not suffer thefate of the commitments that preceded it.Peace and security is a prerequisite fordevelopment. One of the reasons why Africa has failedto register substantial achievements with regard to theMDGs is lack of stability  peace and security.Conflicts  wars and civil strife afflicting the continenthave acted as disincentives to development. The 1885Berlin Conference split Africa up  without due regardto the long-term interests of the African peoples. TheGreat Lakes region found itself at the confluence of allthe colonial Powers. That confluence created a politicaland social situation that has  over the years  proveddifficult to manage. It is a complex situation  with bothpositive and negative tendencies. The cold war furtherexacerbated the situation as the East battled the Westfor influence. Indeed  former Secretary-General DagHammarskjöld lost his life in the context of thatexplosive political mix.As Africa struggles to set its house in order Uganda has identified four main causes of conflict onthe continent which negative forces have exploited fortheir own ends. They include parasitic vested interests;superficiality and obscurantism in identifying anddealing with those parasitic interests and their effectson a particular country or group of countries; weak anddisoriented local leadership; and  finally  thepre-industrial characteristics of Africa.Those are the core causes of conflict  althoughthere are others. Paying clear and careful attention tothem could provide a vital springboard from whichlong-term solutions could be found.The conflict in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and the Great Lakes region in general is causedby a combination of those factors. Those with the mostto lose in the Democratic Republic of the Congo aremarginalized  while real issues of statecraft have beenpushed to the periphery. No attention is being given tocreating institutions and infrastructure that can sustainthe State.The integration of armed factions into one singlenational armed force is half-hearted. How can a Stateexist without the minimum pillars of support  such asan army capable of defending its territorial integrity?The view that justice should precede integrationis wrong  in our opinion. While justice is important  itis Uganda’s belief that it should not take precedenceover the integration of armed groups. We shouldintegrate all factions  and then seek to punish those thatare guilty of any offences later. Uganda advocates theconcept of provisional immunity or immunitéprovisoire  as it is referred to in Burundi. On the otherhand  equal attention needs to be given to issues ofdevelopment  rehabilitation and the recovery of theeconomy. A growing economy is necessary forsustainable peace. What we are witnessing today is arush to elections and political agendas without dueregard being given to the institutions and infrastructurenecessary for the long-term sustainability of peace. Wehave travelled this road before  with disastrousconsequences. Let the immediate past of the continentbe a guiding lesson for all of us.The Lusaka peace accord provided a strongmechanism enabling the region and the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo to play complementary roles inthe peace process. Unfortunately  it has beenabandoned. The central problem of negative forces which the agreement recognized  has been put on theback burner. For over five years  the United NationsOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo (MONUC) has made no significant effort toensure the demobilization and disarmament of thosegroups  thus leaving in place the seeds of futureconflict. We are  however  hopeful that our efforts both at the bilateral level and in the TripartiteCommission  which is composed of Uganda  Rwandaand the Democratic Republic of the Congo  with theparticipation of Burundi  will iron out those problemsand allow our region to attain peace and stability.For some time now  the situation in Burundi hasbeen a real concern to the Great Lakes region and tothe international community at large. The destructionand loss of life that took place spurred the regionalStates  together with South Africa  to undertake andspearhead a peace initiative. It was a long and arduousprocess. With the support of the United Nations and theinternational community  signs of success are todayevident.In the past few months  the people of Burundielected their leaders in local  parliamentary and finally  presidential elections. They look to the futurewith hope. Uganda welcomes His ExcellencyMr. Pierre Nkurunziza  the new President of Burundi 24and we look forward to working with him toconsolidate peace in the region. The internationalcommunity and the United Nations have an obligationto make peace sustainable. Reconstruction rehabilitation and development will be necessary. Wehope that due attention is given to institutionalcapacity-building so that Burundi does not relapse intothe fratricidal anarchy that had been its bane over thepast decade.After two decades of conflict in southern Sudan the people of the Sudan  led by the Government andthe Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement and Army(SPLM/A)  signed the Comprehensive PeaceAgreement earlier this year. The guns are silent  andthe long-tortured people of southern Sudan are nowenjoying some peace. It is unfortunate that the lateJohn Garang passed away at a time whenimplementation of the Agreement was in its earlystages. We are confident that given the commitment ofboth the Government of the Sudan and SPLM thepeace agreement will hold and will be comprehensivelyimplemented. We are also confident that the Sudan isheaded for a peaceful future. We hope that otherconflicts  such as that in Darfur  will be peacefullyresolved using the Comprehensive Peace Agreement asan inspiration and a model.The signature and implementation of theComprehensive Peace Agreement in the Sudan has ledto increased optimism about peace in northern Uganda.The Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA)  a terrorist groupthat has long maimed  kidnapped and terrorized thecivilian population of northern Uganda  for a long timehad sanctuary in southern Sudan  from where itlaunched its terrorist activities. With the cooperation ofthe Sudanese Government  including SPLA/SPLM inthe south  these terrorists are being flushed out fromsouthern Sudan. Uganda’s strategy of peacenegotiations combined with maximum militarypressure has significantly reduced the LRA’s capacityto commit evil. However  as peace returns to theregion  we need international cooperation andassistance to supplement the Government of Uganda’spost-conflict humanitarian  rehabilitation anddevelopment programme  which is already under wayin northern Uganda.Somalia has been in a state of anarchy for morethan a decade and a half. Peace efforts by theinternational community and the United Nations havebeen anything but timid. A sense of frustration on thepart of the United Nations has led to resignation anddespair  thus condemning the Somali people to a stateof bondage and being held hostage by the warlords.It is in this void that the regional States  under theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) took on the mantle of negotiating peace andre-establishing order. Anarchy is contagious. Wecannot feel safe in a situation pregnant with armstrafficking  religious extremism  the dumping ofradioactive waste and the potential for breedingterrorists in the region. These are realistic threats  andIGAD cannot ignore them. The internationalcommunity — and  most especially  the members of theSecurity Council — should not be deluded bygeographical distance. A potential threat tointernational peace truly exists in Somalia.It is in view of these current and latent threatsthat the members of IGAD took upon themselves tonegotiate with Somalia for peace. Over a period of twoyears  we went through a very laborious and sometimesfrustrating negotiating process until agreement wasreached on formation of a Government of nationalunity last year. At the end of the process  we expectedthe Security Council to join us in the pursuit of peace.We expected that all efforts would be geared towardscreating the necessary legal and political atmosphere tofacilitate the realization of peace for the long-sufferingpeople of Somalia.We were  however  deeply disappointed when theCouncil  in its wisdom  acted otherwise  leaving theregion and  most important  the Somali people to theirfate. The decision to uphold the arms embargo and toreject even its partial lifting denied the region a chanceto implement the peace process to its logical end. Wehope that it is not too late for the Council to evaluateand review its position.Let me briefly make some comments on theproposed reform of the United Nations. The institutionwe have today was conceived and created 60 years ago.The sense of triumphalism of the victors in the SecondWorld War  the anguish of the vanquished and theassumed indifference of the colonial peoples especially in Africa  formed the background to the run-up to the creation of the United Nations.The institution that emerged reflected thoserealities. Nowhere within the United Nations  was thismore apparent than in the Security Council. The victorsreserved for themselves the right to determine the25destiny of others. This was done without due regard forthe interests of those that the decisions were to affectmost. Today  the situation has dramatically changed.Colonial peoples have gained independence  and theinternational power structure has changed.Decisions of the Security Council need widersupport diplomatically  financially and militarily inorder to be implemented. It has  therefore  become animperative to reform the Security Council and make itmore representative and reflective of the realities oftoday’s world.In Africa  where most Security Council mandatedoperations take place  we believe that it is time for thecontinent  composed of 53 States  to have a real say inhow those operations are formulated and implemented.Today  Africa is the only continent that has norepresentation at the real decision-making level of theCouncil. It is for these reasons that we demand that thecontinent be given two permanent seats with veto andtwo additional non-permanent seats. A Council thuscomposed will be more democratic and credible andwill have its decisions more widely accepted.While the dream of the founding fathers of theUnited Nations was to save succeeding generationsform the scourge of war  conflicts remain a reality intoday’s world. For 60 years  the United Nations hasfailed to live up to this expectation. Uganda  therefore welcomes the establishment of the PeacebuildingCommission and a Peacebuilding Support Office. Wehope that the 31 December 2005 deadline will be metin order to enable those vital bodies help the UnitedNations effectively address conflict and make peacemore sustainable.In the same vain  we support the establishment ofthe Democracy Fund  which should be used to supportcountries’ home-grown institutions and not as amechanism to import foreign brands of democracy.My delegation is cognizant of the primaryresponsibility of States to protect their own people. Inthe event of failure  the international community has aresponsibility to protect in order to prevent genocideand ethnic cleansing. However  this responsibilityshould be clearly defined and its exercise should havethe prior authorization of the Security Council.We believe that the commitment of our leaders tosupport a stronger relationship between the UnitedNations and regional and subregional organizationswill help expand the capacity of the internationalcommunity to handle the old and new challengesfacing the world. Indeed  regional organizations thathave a capacity for prevention of armed conflict orpeacekeeping should use it to enhance the UnitedNations in this field.The existing Commission on Human Rights hasbeen deficient in its performance over the years. Webelieve that it is time to create an independentinstitution with an effective and clear mandate tohandle human rights. The proposal to create a HumanRights Council is timely. We hope that all thenecessary details will be agreed upon so that thisCouncil can be launched.In conclusion  allow me to restate Uganda’scommitment to the ideals and principles of the UnitedNations. The Organization has served us relatively wellover the years. It is capable of serving us even betterand achieving the dreams and ideals emanated by theframers of the Charter 60 years ago. This can happenonly if we take the bold step of adopting the far-reaching  innovative reforms proposed by theSecretary-General and if we fully implement theoutcome document."
"171",7162,"UKR",60,2005,"At the outset I wish to express my congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. Rest assured that you have the full support and cooperation of the Ukrainian delegation. Let me also pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping  for his tireless efforts in the preparation of the world summit.  The world summit of 2005 has just come to its conclusion. Its outcome document (resolution 60/1) provides us with clear guidelines. It is our common task to implement ambitious goals for building a safer and more prosperous world.   In talking about implementation I wish to emphasize two key elements indispensable for the follow-up activities of the United Nations and  indeed  for the success of the global peace endeavour. They are credibility and democracy — or rather  credibility based on democracy. We know that the way ahead is beset with serious threats and challenges. We have to make sure that a lack of unity is not among those challenges. Every nation likes to sing its own song. It takes our fundamental values and a great deal of human wisdom to perform the role of a tuning fork in the global chorus of so many different voices. The credibility of the United Nations is indispensable if we are to accomplish our missions in the new millennium. Effectiveness  capacity  rapid response  financing for development and all the rest of it will come along with credibility.  Security Council reform is a vivid example of how difficult it is to accommodate the interests of 191 nations. That reminds me of a joke about the distribution of committee posts in the Ukrainian Parliament. They say that we should have 450 committees — that is the number of members of Parliament — in order to make everyone feel happy and important. Unfortunately  we cannot afford to apply a similar approach in the case of the Security Council  since its powers exceed by far those of any other United Nations body. The official position of Ukraine on the matter is clearly reflected in the statement made by President Yushchenko during the summit (see A/60/PV.6). Ukraine highly appreciates the job done by the experts who have explored the various options for Security Council reform. We must not abandon hope and should continue to seek consensus.  Ukraine has fully supported the Secretary-General’s bold initiative to reform the Organization and has actively participated in that process. We reiterate our support for strengthening the position of the Secretary-General. In view of the forthcoming election for Secretary-General in 2006 we would like to remind representatives that throughout the 60-year history of the United Nations it is only representatives of our Eastern European regional group that have never occupied that highest of posts. Therefore  we believe that the Eastern European Group has priority in nominating a candidate.  In building this statement around the words “credibility” and “democracy”  I cannot but stress the key function of the Organization  which is to maintain international peace and security. The memory of Rwanda  Srebrenica or  quite recently  Darfur should lead us to look for urgent remedies. One of these could lie in the “responsibility to protect” concept  which Ukraine fully endorses. We must not remain passive observers of genocide  crimes against humanity or gross and flagrant violations of human rights  as happened in 1932-1933 when Ukrainians experienced the great famine with devastating effects. The horrible memory of that man-made calamity lives on today in every Ukrainian family  including my own. Twenty thousand innocent souls a day  half a million a month  10 million altogether were taken as part of the death toll of Stalin’s favoured ethnic policy. The Ukrainian Government will never tire until it makes the international community abandon hypocrisy and finally recognize that act of genocide against the Ukrainian nation. It was therefore in earnest and with much hope that Ukraine followed the deliberations on the new concept.   Early warning  prevention and rapid response are key to ensuring the success and durability of our concerted action. An expert combination of diplomatic  political and assistance tools should suffice to avert future humanitarian disasters. But should such measures fail to stop atrocities  the Security Council must be ready to act swiftly and resolutely  including with the use of force  as a final resort. I should like to reiterate the position of Ukraine that  apart from self-  05-51226 19  defence as provided for in Article 51 of the Charter  only the Security Council may legitimately take decisions on the use of force.   Peace and stability go hand in hand with human rights  the rule of law and freedom of the media. The credibility of Governments rests on those fundamental values. We were all aware of malfunctions in the Commission on Human Rights. Poor mechanisms led to poor results. The credibility of the entire Organization was at stake. Therefore  Ukraine welcomes the establishment of the Human Rights Council. We firmly believe that this important achievement of the Organization will be reflected in the new Council’s future activities  not only in the change of name. Likewise  Ukraine supports the establishment of the United Nations Democracy Fund.  Another matter of significance that should enhance the credibility of the United Nations is the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission. It is evident that conflict resolution always requires a complex approach. The institutional gap between prevention  settlement and post-conflict rehabilitation has finally to be eliminated.  To save time at this late hour  I shall not mention many areas of cooperation and many regions of the world that genuinely require our undiminished attention and action. Non-proliferation; hot and frozen conflicts; AIDS; the fight against poverty; the Middle East; and Iraq: most often these are issues of the democracy of governance or the credibility of policies  or both.   To conclude  let me recall the phenomenon of the Orange Revolution in my country  for it was the quintessence of what our Organization stands for. It was not a one-time act. It is a process. It is not country-specific  but is part of the global heritage of democracy  an unselfish gift to all nations striving for freedom around the globe. "
"172",7209,"URY",60,2005,"I wouldlike to extend the sincerest condolences of the peopleand Government of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay tothe victims of Hurricane Katrina  as well as to all thecitizens of the world  men and women  old and young who are victims of natural disasters  of the fury ofnature  which is showing us that it will no longer beabused by mankind.I come from Uruguay  a small South Americancountry  whose main wealth is its vocation for peace its drive for freedom and the democratic commitmentthat its people have been forging for generations.I convey the greetings of the people andGovernment of Uruguay to this forum  which is thebroadest  most representative and most importantforum in the world today. It is a greeting that isdemanding  committed and hopeful.The greeting is demanding because we are livingat a very particular time in the history of mankind. Infact  at very few moments in history have we seencircumstances so rich in paradoxes and so poor inparadigms as the present one. Never before hasmankind had at its disposal such scientific andtechnological progress and such a significant culturalheritage to guarantee a life in dignity. However  neverbefore has mankind suffered so much inequality intolerance and uncertainty.We know that we have reached this point  but weare uncertain about where we are heading. We cannotbe passive witnesses to the situation; no one can washhis hands of his own problems nor of problems thatseem remote. We cannot resign ourselves to a futurethat is an unchanging extension of the present. There isno reason whatsoever to give up the hope of a utopia without which darkness could be our fate.Our greeting is committed because we all bear theresponsibility  which we cannot abdicate  of being themasters of our own lives and the architects of our ownfutures. This task is a road on which neither privilegesnor condemnations are allowed; we are all travellingon an equal footing. Nor does this road permitshortcuts. History is neither a gallery of national heroesnor a calendar of outstanding events: history is madeby people day by day.In this context  we upon whom our peoples haveconferred the task of governing have a very demandingresponsibility ahead of us. And that is becausegoverning means managing with efficiency andtransparency: it means articulating in a democraticfashion this rich and complex network that is society.But to govern means also to envisage the future and tocall upon people to build that future among all and forall.Our greeting is hopeful as well. Although we donot overlook the risks  the difficulties and the limitswithin the national  regional and global contexts  webelieve in human beings  we believe in society. Webelieve in democracy as a means to govern but also asa human impulse and as a state of society.Although I said this during our statement at theHigh-level Plenary Meeting which took place in thissame Hall a few hours ago  I wish to reiterate beforethe Assembly that the Eastern Republic of Uruguayreaffirms the principles that have characterized itsforeign policy.First is the firm commitment to peace sovereignty  democracy and solidarity. When I speakabout peace  democracy  solidarity and freedom Iwould like to recall that six days ago marked the thirty-second anniversary of the occasion when a man gavehis life defending peace  democracy and freedom. Iwould like thus to pay tribute to Salvador Allende.The second principle is the firm rejection of anykind of terrorism  violence and discrimination. Thethird is the inalienable right of every State to safe andstable borders and to be completely free to exercise itssovereignty and self-determination  and fourth isrespect for international law as the best guarantee ofthe sovereignty of peoples and their peacefulcoexistence.28The fifth principle is non-alignment and non-intervention in affairs that come under the domesticjurisdiction of States. Sixthly  we reaffirmmultilateralism as a means to strengthen internationallaw  enhancing the role of the United Nations. Seventh we acknowledge the indivisibility of all human rights be they political  social  economic  civil or cultural including those of a collective nature such as the rightto development and to a safe environment.In conformity with these principles  Uruguay firstof all deems it necessary to move forward with thereforms that will allow the United Nations to fullyfulfil its commitments. Because such reforms are of acomplex nature  they should be undertaken with asense of history and with political will  and withouthegemonic intentions.Secondly  Uruguay renews its commitment to theMillennium Goals  which in our country means thedesign and implementation of a system of integratedand global social policies that address the poverty anddestitution suffered by almost one million Uruguayansand that  at the same time  are part of a strategy ofchange and development.Thirdly  Uruguay reiterates its will to continueparticipating in United Nations peacekeepingoperations and will contribute its efforts to improvingthe security and the conditions of service of thosemissions.We also express our support for the Secretary-Generalís initiative to create a Peace Commission  towhich  we believe  Uruguay could contribute continuing its support for peacekeeping missions andthe expertise acquired in rebuilding devastatedcountries.There is no peace in intolerance and terrorism  nofreedom in poverty  and no democracy in inequality. Itis crucial to reject every expression of violence  butbefore rejecting it  it must be avoided by attacking itsroots.This is quite simply because every human being simply by being human  has the right to live in dignity.Societies where there is a contrast between an opulentfew and a neglected majority are not prosperous.Societies where to be born is a problem  to be young issuspect  to get an education and a job is a privilege andto grow old is a curse have no future. This is the waywe see it in Uruguay. We have learned this from thosegenerations that preceded us in building a country that though it has its own unique features  is not atypical ofnor alien to the Latin American context.While it is true that the first half of the lastcentury was a favourable period for Uruguay  it is alsotrue that - due to a combination of externalcircumstances and domestic structural weaknesses -the last fifty years were a period of economicdeterioration  impoverishment and even an institutionalbreakdown in 1973.We Uruguayans regained democracy in 1985  andthe current Government  which took office exactly 200days ago  is working hard to heal the woundsdictatorship caused through human rights violations.We are not hostages to the past  but Uruguayan societyneeds to know the truth about what happened to ensurethat never again will it happen - never again.Nevertheless  with the commitments that we haveassumed to Uruguayan society - whose will is ourmandate ó the Government of which I am head ispromoting changes: changes which are necessary possible  responsible and gradual  changes withpolitical and social support  changes that do notoverlook reality but do not give up on the dream of aUruguay with human development  with productiveeconomic growth and with a safe environment  aUruguay fully integrated into its own region and intothe international arena. We are not starting fromscratch  but we have a lot to do to achieve this utopia the dream of which motivates us as a nation.In conclusion  this is exactly what I wished toconvey to members on behalf of the Government andthe people of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay: faraway  in the forgotten southern part of South America there is a country that does not resign itself todifficulties  that is building its own destiny and that faithful to its tradition  wishes to join in building abetter world  working alongside all our dear brethren the citizens of the world."
"173",7256,"USA",60,2005," On behalfof President Bush and all of the American people welcome to New York City.In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  my fellowcitizens have experienced the compassion of the UnitedNations. I want to thank Secretary-General Annan formobilizing the support of this institution. I also want tothank the representatives of the 126 countries that haveoffered assistance in our relief efforts. The UnitedStates will never forget their generosity in our time ofneed.In moments of tumultuous historical change leaders must become architects of a better world. Wemust survey the new international landscape  lay firmfoundations of moral principle and build institutions8that reflect our unique moment in history. It is thoseinstitutions that enable citizens of conviction to lead usever closer to the ideals of justice that stir every soul:the universal desire for security  prosperity  liberty anddignity.Sixty years ago was just such a time oftransformation. After one of the greatest cataclysms inworld history  the United States joined with visionarybuilders from over 50 countries to create the UnitedNations. We placed the enduring principles of humanrights and fundamental freedoms at the foundation ofthe United Nations Charter. We built an institution thathas helped to support a peaceful world order for sixdecades. Today  however  with the end of the cold warand the rise of globalization and the emergence of newthreats  the very terrain of international politics hasshifted beneath our feet. In this new world we mustagain embrace the challenge of building for the future.The time to reform the United Nations is now. Wemust seize this opportunity together. Chapter I  Article1  of the Charter of the United Nations proclaims thefour purposes of the United Nations  great aspirationsthat have stood the test of time. But consider whatdifferent forms they take today  in 2005  as opposed to1945  when they were first declared.The first purpose of the United Nations is to helpmaintain international peace and security. In 1945 themost serious threats to peace and security emergedbetween States  and were largely defined by theirborders. Today  however  the greatest threats we faceemerge within States  and melt through their borders:transnational threats like terrorism and the proliferationof weapons  pandemic disease and trafficking in humanbeings.The second purpose of this institution  as writtenin the United Nations Charter  is to develop friendlyrelations among nations  based on equal rights and theself-determination of all peoples. In 1945  a life ofliberty and dignity was more an aspiration than areality for a majority of the world’s people. Today however  more nations than ever have enshrined theprinciples of democracy and human rights — a truemoral triumph that will be complete only when allindividuals are secure in their basic freedoms.The third purpose of the United Nations is toachieve international cooperation in solvinginternational problems. In 1945  the fear was thatstrong  aggressive States  eager and able to expandtheir frontiers with force  would be the primary causeof international problems. Today  however  it is clearthat weak and poorly governed States  unwilling orincapable of ruling their countries with justice  are theprincipal source of global crises  from civil war andgenocide to extreme poverty and humanitarian disaster.The final purpose of the United Nations  as theCharter states  is to be a centre for harmonizing theactions of nations in the attainment of common ends.In 1945  the world’s leaders joined together to build aninstitutional partnership that could address the sharedchallenges of their time. Today  faced with the realitiesof a new world  we must transform the United Nationsto meet the shared challenges of our time.The Members of this body must work together tostrengthen security in a world threatened by statelessextremists. Today  I call on the nations of the world toratify the comprehensive convention on terrorism. Nocause  no movement and no grievance can justify theintentional killing of innocent civilians and non-combatants. That is unacceptable by any moralstandard. It is time for every Member of the UnitedNations to outlaw acts of international terrorism.We must also work together to promoteprosperity and development in a world of greatpotential. The United States is committed to theMillennium Development Goals. And at the MonterreyConference three years ago all nations agreed thatdevelopment must be a two-way street. Donorcountries have a responsibility to increase theirassistance to developing nations. And developingnations have a responsibility to govern justly  advanceeconomic liberty and invest in their people. TheMonterrey Consensus is working.Now is not the time to revert to old  failedthinking about development. Countries representingthree quarters of the developing world’s population areon a pace to meet the targets of the MillenniumDeclaration by 2015.And  as President Bush said on Wednesday  theUnited States is prepared to take new action toaccelerate this progress: we will eliminate all tariffsand subsidies that distort free trade — as other nationsdo the same.Members of the United Nations must worktogether as well to support democracy in a world ofexpanding liberty. To advance this common purpose  in92004 President Bush proposed the creation of ademocracy fund. With the broad support of this body we have made it a reality. The Fund is now receivingdonations in cash and in kind from countries large andsmall that wish to help other nations lay thefoundations of democracy. Showing its leadership asthe world’s largest democracy  India made the generousopening pledge of $10 million.Now  to be sure  when speaking about democracy the United States has every reason for humility. Afterall  it was only in my lifetime that America guaranteedthe right to vote for all its citizens. Obviously  the pathto democracy is long and imperfect and different forevery nation. But the principles of democracy areuniversal  as is the desire for them. And the UnitedNations must support every country that embraces thechallenge of self-government. In Afghanistan  Iraq Lebanon  the Palestinian territories and throughout theworld  peoples who want to build democracy deserveour help.The many goals we share are great indeed. Andthe United Nations has a major role to play in theirachievement. But for this institution to become anengine of change in the twenty-first century  it mustnow change itself. The United Nations must launch alasting revolution of reform.The United Nations summit declaration(resolution 60/1)  which every head of State endorsedthis week  expresses a global consensus on the fact thatreform is imperative. I want to thank former GeneralAssembly President Ping for his tireless hard work.Our challenge now  under President Eliasson’sleadership  is to enact the vital reforms that will makethe United Nations more accountable to its Members more suited to new challenges and more faithful to itsfounding purposes.The United States welcomes the commitment ofall leaders to establish a new PeacebuildingCommission. Now  we must embrace the difficult taskof implementing that vision. A PeacebuildingCommission should plan for post-conflict missionsbefore crises erupt. And it must help to coordinatereconstruction efforts after the fighting stops. In aworld threatened by civil strife  the United Nationsneeds to be better prepared to help countries rebuild inthe aftermath of conflict.We are also pleased that the world’s leaders haverecognized the importance of establishing a newHuman Rights Council. But it will take a lot of hardwork in the coming months to realize that goal. TheHuman Rights Council must have fewer members  lesspolitics and more credibility. And it should never never  empower brutal dictatorships to sit in judgementof responsible democracies. The Human RightsCouncil must have the moral authority to condemn allviolators of human rights  even those that sit among usin this Hall.Finally  we welcome the promise of the world’sleaders to make the United Nations a more effectiveand a more principled institution. As President Bushsaid on Wednesday (see A/60/PV.2)  the UnitedNations must stand for integrity and live by the highstandards it sets for others. For the United Nations tochampion democracy more legitimately  we mustincrease the transparency and the accountability of thisinstitution. For the United Nations to promoteprosperity more credibly  tougher ethics rules andgreater internal oversight are needed to ensure thehighest professional standards. And to make the UnitedNations relevant to the challenges of today  the purposeand the performance of all United Nations programmesmust be reviewed thoroughly  consistently andcomprehensively.Our fellow citizens deserve a United Nations thatcommands their respect and is worthy of their hard-earned tax dollars. In a democracy  leaders must beable to justify that their people’s money is indeed beingwell spent.Real progress on those fundamental reforms willprove that the United Nations can address greaterissues of change  in particular the reform of theSecurity Council. We want that important body toreflect the world as it is in 2005  not as it was in 1945.The United States is open to expanding the SecurityCouncil. We have long supported a permanent seat forJapan. And we believe that developing countriesdeserve greater representation on that body. All thiswould make for a more effective Security Council.And the Security Council must be effective. Itmust be able to deal with great challenges such asterrorism and nuclear proliferation  especially when itfaces real threats and when countries such as Iranthreaten the effectiveness of the global non-proliferation regime. When diplomacy has been10exhausted  the Security Council must become involved.Questions about Iran’s nuclear activities remainunanswered  despite repeated efforts by theInternational Atomic Energy Agency. And afteragreeing to negotiate with Europe  Iran unilaterallywalked away from the talks and restarted its nuclearprogrammes. Iran should return to the negotiationswith the European Union three and abandon forever itsplans for a nuclear-weapons capability.The experience of recent years has reinforced theuniversal truth that international institutions are only asstrong and effective and relevant as their memberschoose to make them. The United Nations is nodifferent.The United States believes in a United Nationsthat is strong and effective. And we have ambitioushopes for its future.So in this year  as the United Nations marks itssixtieth anniversary  let us recommit ourselves toprincipled action. Let us embrace the same spirit ofcreation that moved the builders and leaders of 1945.And let us reform this great institution to meet thechallenges of a new era."
"174",7279,"UZB",60,2005,"First of all  let me take this opportunity to congratulateMr. Jan Eliasson on his election to the high position ofPresident of the General Assembly and to wish himevery success in guiding the work of the session. Iwould also like to thank his predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping for his able leadership as the President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session.It is obvious that the years-long process ofreorganizing the entire system of internationalrelations  in particular reform of the United Nations has been unreasonably delayed. The 2005 summit wasan important stage in exploring mutually acceptableformulas and in adopting goals whose implementationwill lead us to the achievement of development andsecurity.Some of the decisions taken at the summit weremedium-term and others long-term in nature. But  inour view  our primary task is to ensure their fullimplementation and not to allow inertia to impede this as has been the case in the process of implementing theMillennium Development Goals.Strengthening the capacity of the United Nationsto achieve its goals in the three areas of development security and human rights requires appropriate andactive adaptation of the entire United Nations system.In this connection we consider it important to make thefollowing comments. First  regardless of howimportant it is to reform and modernize the UnitedNations  there is  at present  no alternative to theOrganization.Secondly  further delay in reform of the mostimportant bodies of the Organization will negativelyimpact its role in the modern world. There is a realdanger that if the United Nations fails to take action  itscoordinating role will gradually pass to otherinternational structures  which lack the degree of broadrepresentation that the United Nations enjoys.Thirdly  the reform of three main bodies of theUnited Nations — the General Assembly  the SecurityCouncil and the Economic and Social Council —should provide balance in their work. In that regard  weconsider it to be in our common interest that SecurityCouncil reform not be prolonged. It should be carried26out during the main part of the sixtieth session  beforethe year is out.Fourthly  regional approaches should be givenpriority in dealing with development  security andhuman rights issues. The effectiveness of the principleof moving from regional to global approaches hasalready been proved on many occasions.At present  Uzbekistan is implementing itsnational goals for economic development. It is carryingout economic reforms and taking measures tostrengthen regional economic cooperation. However any national efforts need to be supported byinternational economic structures. It is important thatgenuine conditions for an equal and fair internationaleconomic order be established. International donorsmust provide their full support for regionalcooperation  and interested developing countries  inturn  need to make that kind of cooperation an integralpart of their national strategy.We believe it important for the concernedregional commissions of the United Nations — theEconomic Commission for Europe and the Economicand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific — tostrengthen their work to assist economic developmentin Central Asia  with a view to the greater and broaderinvolvement of the countries of the region ininternational economic relations and investmentcooperation. We are of the view that the internationalcommunity  including the United Nations  should payserious attention to the question of creating a CentralAsian common market capable of ensuring the rationaland effective use of the rich potential and resources ofthe region.Uzbekistan supports all efforts to ensuresustainable development. Member States should pooltheir efforts to tackle problems of environmentaldegradation  shortages of water resources and drinkingwater and the deterioration of environmentalconditions in cities and industrial zones. The globalenvironmental agenda also calls for the pressing issuesof desertification  biodiversity and climate change tobe addressed.Acts of terrorism carried out in many regions ofthe world  including Central Asia  have once againreminded us of the need for a critical assessment of thepractice of international cooperation  including withinthe United Nations  to counter that plague of thetwenty-first century  which threatens rich and poorStates alike. It is unacceptable to further delay takingmeasures against those international centres ofterrorism and extremism that — under the guise ofespousing universal human values — in fact developand disseminate ideologies of fanaticism. In thatconnection  we welcome the Security Council’s mostrecent counter-terrorism resolution — resolution 1624(2005) of 14 September 2005 — on the suppression ofincitement to terrorist acts. At the same time  webelieve it is crucial not to allow double standards in theimplementation of that instrument. Thoseconsiderations should also be concerns in the processof drafting a universal convention on internationalterrorism.A powerful accomplice of international terrorismis drug trafficking. Unfortunately  no actual progresshas been seen in reducing drug production inAfghanistan. On that issue  we need to move urgentlyfrom words to action. In that connection  we arecounting on the international community’s firm supportfor Uzbekistan’s initiative to establish a Central Asianregional information and coordination centre to countertransboundary crimes related to drug trafficking.The President returned to the Chair.Together with the pressing problems ofdevelopment and security there is the issue of humanrights. That issue is central to forging a new path ininternational relations  and to United Nations reform in particular. In his report  “In larger freedom”(A/59/2005)  the Secretary-General notes thatinternational treaties adopted over the past six decadesform an impressive normative basis for ensuring fullinternational acknowledgement and respect for humanrights and freedoms. There is no doubt that protectionof human rights needs to be one of the core tasks forthe United Nations.Uzbekistan is a party to all the majorinternational human rights instruments and it issteadily moving towards democracy and the formationof a civil society. One important step in that directionwas the decision to abolish the death penalty in thecountry  as proposed by Uzbekistan’s President IslamKarimov.We are convinced that reform of the UnitedNations human rights system needs to be carried outstep by step  consistently  and taking into account theconcerns of all interested parties. Along with politicalrights  it is necessary to strengthen other human rights 27including socio-economic and environmental rights.We reiterate our position that it is unacceptable topoliticize the issue of human rights or to be selective inreviewing human rights situations  even more so whenUnited Nations bodies or mechanisms are involved.The establishment of a stable and long-lastingpeace in Afghanistan is of strategic value forUzbekistan. In that context  we welcome theparliamentary elections that were held in Afghanistanon 18 September. That event has become anotherimportant step towards restoring statehood toAfghanistan. Uzbekistan supports the efforts aimed atthe prompt stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan.Considering Afghanistan to be a part of the CentralAsian region  we encourage its active participation inregional integration processes. Uzbekistan is providingbroad support to the Afghan people  as well as torelevant mechanisms of the United Nations and otherinternational organizations  to aid the reconstructionprocess in that country.Five years after the Millennium Summit  MemberStates have adopted an historic decision to launchreform and renovate the mechanisms of the UnitedNations. We have a unique opportunity to carry outmore far-reaching reforms to adapt the Organization tonew realities. The aim of those reforms is to ensure thewell-being and prosperity of all our peoples. Today thetime has come to make decisions and take action. Anyprotraction of the process could seriously paralyse thesystem of international relations  allow current threatsand challenges to become irreversible  and lead to asituation in which the international community isunable to take timely and appropriate measures.In conclusion  I would like to reiterate thereadiness of Uzbekistan to cooperate actively withother States in creating more effective and just UnitedNations."
"175",7291,"VAT",60,2005,"The summitmarking the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nationsis over  but to bring it to completion our work heremust build upon its outcome document (resolution60/1) so as to fulfil the agreed package of reforms withvision and determination. The Holy See  havingfollowed the outcome document's development closely welcomes much of what is proposed. However  thelack of consensus on arms control and non-proliferation issues is regrettable.I should also like to add at the outset that theHoly See understands the references to both the CairoInternational Conference on Population andDevelopment and the outcome of the Fourth WorldConference on Women  held in Beijing  and toreproductive health found in paragraphs 57 (g)  58 and58 (c) in the sense that it set out in its reservations andstatements of interpretation at those Conferences  thatis  as applying to a holistic concept of health that doesnot consider abortion or access to abortion as adimension of those terms. These caveats aside  thedocument is a basis for implementation and ongoingdiscussions on United Nations reform.Due to the human tragedies of genocide  warcrimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity the ""responsibility to protect""  as reflected in theoutcome document  has  for humanitarian reasons gained more acceptance. Its definitive legalformulation could greatly contribute to the enrichmentnot only of international law but also of sinceresolidarity among nations. To identify carefully andhonestly the causes of such man-made disasters isindispensable to creating more timely preventionmeasures. Protection of those in distress and assistanceto them go hand in hand with lucid analysis and publicawareness of the causes of humanitarian crises.The silence of the outcome document regardingdisarmament and non-proliferation is worrying.Nuclear armament is simply devastating for people andfor the environment; it destroys people's lives and thesubstratum of every decent economy. We thereforemust insist upon nuclear non-proliferation. Likewise we must insist on complete nuclear disarmament and astrengthened International Atomic Energy Agencyverification and safeguards system. No effort should bespared to discourage not only the production of nuclearweapons but also any trade or exchange in suchmaterials.Of course  a secure world will not just be free ofthe menace of war: it will be one where sustainablehuman development is also assured  through soundglobal governance. But  while global governance has alogic of its own  it lacks its own ethics  somethingwhich the world's nations must supply. We live in aninterdependent but fragile society and  in many places people's best interests are not served well. I should liketo mention here but three specific areas of ethicalchallenge in this regard: solidarity with the poor  thepromotion of the common good  and a sustainableenvironment.Small gains made in this last area remain underrisk from  among other things  climate change  newdiseases  the irresponsible destruction of forests  waterpollution  depletion of fish stocks  the destruction ofglobal commons such as the oceans  and so on. It isestimated that 15 out of 24 essential services providedby ecosystems are being used unsustainably. Theenormity of today's environmental challenge obliges usto rethink our notions of interdependence  globalcooperation and our common responsibility for thestewardship of the planet. Differences on how toaddress challenges should not stop agreement on theidentification of specific environmental threats andcommon measures to tackle them.Another core principle needs to be set out in theform of the proper devolution of power to local levelsto ensure greater effectiveness and accountability known also as subsidiarity. The application of thisprinciple would foster a genuine respect for the rightsof nations and for the significance of culture  balancingparticularism and universalism. Global governance alsohas to address the democracy deficit in order to assureglobalization without marginalization.In this context  the United Nations becomes theprojection of the hope for peace and well-being in theworld. To fulfil this high calling  which is proper to theOrganization's nature and function  will require clearcharacteristics of leadership  the courage of theOrganization and those who are part of it and acommon vision for its leaders  collaborators andinterlocutors at every level  so that they may succeed infinding the right road to achieve the goals in view.30On the subject of the Human Rights Council  areform that improves upon the present arrangements isto be welcomed. International law and its institutionsare vital for the application and enforcement of humanrights. Likewise  we should not lose sight of theimportance that the Universal Declaration of HumanRights attaches to the incorporation of its principlesinto national law and to education in fostering a rights-respecting culture. Promotion and enforcement ofhuman rights at the national level and constantattention to education will continue to be indispensableto allow those rights to flourish in the new system.The international community  the happypossessor of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights since 1948  appears  however  in the meantimeto have forgotten that not only essential human rightsbut also human duties underpin the Declaration. Theseduties establish the framework in which our rights arecontained  so that the latter are not simply exercisedupon a whim. The reference to duties in the UniversalDeclaration reminds us that rights usually entailresponsibilities; and that if we expect our own rights tobe respected  we must respect the rights of others.Indeed  the Declaration's recognition of theinterdependence of rights and duties was one of the keyfeatures that enabled it to win consensus from nationsEast and West  North and South. Today  whenglobalization has rendered us more interdependent thanever  a greater sense of universal human duties wouldbenefit the cause of peace  because awareness of ourmutual responsibility acknowledges duties as beingessential to a social order which does not depend uponthe will or the power of any individual or group.The question has resurfaced of how there can beuniversal rights in view of the diversity amongcultures. Some maintain that all rights are culturallyrelative; others claim that universal rights are justinstruments of a given cultural imperialism; and somebelieve the gulf between those two positions cannot bebridged. My delegation  however  shares the faith ofthe principal framers of the Universal Declaration  thatcertain values are so fundamental that they can findsupport in the moral and philosophical traditions ofcultures. For that reason  such universal principles orbasic human rights are undeniable. In their essentialcore they have to be universally recognized and mustbe operative erga omnes. To reject the idea that basicrights are relative  however  does not require one toreject a legitimate pluralism in their implementation.Quite the contrary  for pluralism is the only way tomove beyond the sterile relativism-imperialism debate.The Holy See  on the basis of its own longexperience in seeing how a common core of principlescan take root and flourish in vastly different cultures affirms the wisdom of the drafters of the UniversalDeclaration in this respect. The framework theyfashioned is flexible enough to allow for differences inemphasis and implementation  but not so malleable asto permit any basic human right to be completelyeclipsed or unnecessarily subordinated for the sake ofother rights. Regrettably  the legitimately pluralistapproach to basic rights is sometimes forgotten  but itmust be retrieved if we are to avoid a top-down homogenizing vision of human rights.In the wake of recent acts of terrible violence calls have come from various quarters to promotegreater understanding among religions  cultures andcivilizations. The Holy See supports the initiatives inthe field of interfaith cooperation and dialogue amongcivilizations  especially where  in the spirit of theirreference to and reliance on God  they formconsciences  foster common moral values and promoteintercultural understanding and proactivecommitments. Those tasks require continuedevaluation with regard to motivation  policies  laws andinstitutions. It is the mission of civil and religiousleaders to be a source of inspiration  support andguidance for all people of good will who strive towardssustainable peace.The Holy See also understands that there is aparticular type of interreligious dialogue in whichreligious representatives and their constituents engagein discussion on the theological and spiritual tenets oftheir respective religions and exchange positiveexperiences with a view to promoting mutualunderstanding and respect among all. That type ofdialogue does not appear to be part of the UnitedNations Charter and is therefore better left to religiousexperts and appropriate representatives of religions.Nevertheless  the United Nations can make a valid andimportant contribution to interfaith cooperation forpeace and development.In concluding  I should like to add a word ofacknowledgement of the important contribution thatthe United Nations staff makes to the Organization inits efforts to promote harmony and solidarity amongpeoples. Likewise  I should like to express once againto you  Sir  the best wishes and support of mydelegation as you look ahead to an important andfruitful presidency of the General Assembly."
"176",7326,"VCT",60,2005,"The sixtieth anniversary of the UnitedNations coincides with the commemoration of mycountry’s twenty-fifth year of independence. Thepreamble to the Constitution of Saint Vincent and theGrenadines reaffirms that our nation is founded on thebelief in the supremacy of God and the freedom anddignity of man. Our national motto  Pax et justitia —Peace and justice — symbolizes both our reality andour dream. The universal ideals which inspired thefounding fathers of the United Nations are those whichprompted the lofty proclamations in my nation’sConstitution. The United Nations Charter taught us atruth  as though engraved on a tablet of stone  thatwhile some sleep to dream  we must dream to changethe world for the better.We in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines acceptunequivocally the fulcrum around which the outcomedocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting revolves namely  to create a more peaceful  prosperous anddemocratic world  and to undertake concrete measuresto continue finding ways to implement the conclusionsof the Millennium Summit and other major UnitedNations gatherings so as to provide multilateralsolutions to the problems which touch and concerndevelopment  peace and collective security  humanrights and the rule of law  and the strengthening of theUnited Nations.Yet the outcome document  though certainly acodified and presumably consensual package  fallsshort of what is truly demanded by these extraordinary challenging times in the first decade of the twenty-firstcentury. The larger and more powerful nations aregripped by an unreasonable fear which  in the process constrains them from being reasonably fair. Lesspowerful nation-States and those which are small andweak internationally often beat their collective chestswith an unbecoming self-righteous purity that restrainsthem from knowing or understanding what impurity is even within themselves.So  an unwholesome stand-off results.Meanwhile  around us all  there is a carnival of misery a festival of guns. A Caribbean poet laureate tells usthat the faces of men and women are strained andanxious. Many  if not most persons  becomesceptical — nay  cynical — of the grand efforts of theworld’s leaders. They search instead for an amazinggrace which makes the blind to see and the wretched tobe saved. Along the way  the majesty of faith becomesmetamorphosed  in too many of the world’sinhabitants  into a believer’s extremism. Man’s reasoncannot quite fathom  this side of eternity  the evilwhich extremism breeds. That is an enduringconundrum of our times which  in this earthly city  we amidst all our limitations and weaknesses  must seek toaddress appropriately with all our possibilities andstrengths  but without the baggage of economic military or cultural imperialism.Economic imperialism muzzles the mouth withthe food that it eats to live and thus builds resentmentin that very mouth that eats  and even more so amongthose who receive no food to eat. Military imperialism13begets armed resistance in which a triumph is but apause in its impermanence. Cultural imperialismdistorts the mind  but in that very distortion the seed ofits rejection germinates  blossoms and bears a bitterand even chauvinistic fruit. The presumed solutions ofthe powerful have been shown  historically  to bemirages. Surely  there must be a better way. NelsonMandela has taught us that. Together  we are the world;we are the future. But of all time  only the future isours to desecrate; the present is the past  and the past isour fathers’ mischiefs.Underlying all of this is a seemingly intractablesocio-economic product of modern globalization — thecontradiction between  on the one hand  a growinginequality in income distribution globally and  on theother  the increasing commonality of consumptionpatterns. Modern communications  including therevolution in information technology  have connectedthe world as never before. Yet  that very enhancedconnection breeds  justifiably  a great impatienceamong those who are most disadvantaged. Economicadjustment has to be made more swiftly. Time is of theessence  but that very swiftness engenders socio-economic dislocation  which poses immensedifficulties for political management.Those profound challenges require a series ofmeasures  including more official developmentassistance more speedily disbursed  a fair system ofinternational trade  international peace based on triedand tested principles of international law  appropriatereformation of the United Nations and its associateinstitutions  and a more tolerant and educatedpopulation worldwide. But we must set about doing soimmediately with conviction  resolution  solidarity anddignity. The alternative is apocalypse now.No difficulties  no hardships  no crises  canjustify terrorism. Terrorism wounds the poor anddisadvantaged ever so much. Its barbarism mustcontinue to be resisted by civilized peoples and nationsinternationally. No space must be given to terrorism.A small multi-island nation like Saint Vincent andthe Grenadines has a bundle of special needs. We are therefore  encouraged by the collective recognition byall the Member States of the United Nations thatspecial needs and vulnerabilities attend small islanddeveloping States. We are heartened  too  by thereaffirmation of the Member States’ commitment toaddress these special needs and vulnerabilities. Thereare reams of paper commitments in the MauritiusStrategy adopted by the International Meeting toReview the Implementation of the Programme ofAction for the Sustainable Development of SmallIsland Developing States  in the Barbados Programmeof Action and in the outcome document of the twenty-second special session of the General Assembly.We realize that the just-concluded United NationsHigh-level Plenary Meeting has undertaken to promotegreater international cooperation and partnership forthe implementation of the solemn commitmentsthrough  among other things  the mobilization ofdomestic and international resources  the promotion ofinternational trade as an engine for development andincreased international financial and technicalcooperation.These splendid commitments and undertakings like all words  must be made flesh if they are to signifyanything. To be sure  heard melodies are sweet  butthose unheard will be sweeter in uplifting action. Inthis regard  I reaffirm  without here repeating  all that Istated in my speech to this body last Friday 16 September  on the development agenda focused onthe Millennium Development Goals and a sustainablecondition beyond them for countries like my own.Certainly  a fair resolution to the banana trade impassein Europe must be fashioned without condemning ourpoor banana farmers and workers to further penury andmisery.The recent occurrences in Asia  the Caribbeanand the southern United States of devastating stormsand hurricanes  and in Africa  of terrible droughts demand a more coordinated and rational approachinternationally to issues of climate change  disasterpreparedness  and post-disaster rehabilitation. By andlarge  there have been ad hoc national  as distinct frominternational  approaches. To the extent thatinternational mechanisms exist for prompt andappropriate relief work  they are clearly inadequate forthe tasks at hand.This is undoubtedly an area in which the UnitedNations and one or more of its agencies or associateinstitutions ought to be able to make a significantdifference to the well being of real flesh-and-bloodpeople. After all  natural disasters respect no territorialboundaries or power blocs; calamities from nature havea studied ideological neutrality. They are the same sadsongs heard from ancient times by emperor  vassals14and clown; and in modern times  increasingly by therich and the poor. But they afflict the poor moredisastrously than any other group. This matter demandsurgent international attention. The pain and anguishevoked by President George Bush in his most recentspeech on the Katrina disaster must surely move toconcerted international action even those who standamid the alien corn.A sustained  coordinated response is needed if weare to avoid an ignoble “disaster fatigue” that treats anatural disaster in one country as a momentarydistraction from normalcy  as television imagesdetermine  until the next one arrives. Grenada is a casein point. It was laid waste in September 2004 byHurricane Ivan  but its recovery effort has been slowedby the focus on the more recent catastrophes fromnature in South Asia  Niger and the southern UnitedStates. Grenada still cries out for massive internationalassistance. We must help. There is still an enduringneed  even after the television cameras have goneelsewhere. This applies  too  in relation to man-madedisasters  such as in Darfur.The ever-deteriorating state of affairs in ourCaribbean Community (CARICOM) neighbour Haitidemonstrates vividly the inherent dangers of meddlingwith the democratic process. Since I spoke on theissue  more in sadness than in anger  one year ago  thesituation has disintegrated. The so-called Government implanted without any mandate from the people  hasneither the political will nor the popular support toundertake the measures necessary to return that poor traumatized country to some semblance of normalcy.There has been no serious effort at disarming the gangsthat roam the towns and countryside and practice mobjustice. Political victimization continues apace with thecruel detention and violation of the human rights offormer Prime Minister Yvon Neptune  the most glaringexample; while  on the other side of the coin  thedecision of the Supreme Court to quash the sentencesof 15 thugs from the Front for Advancement andProgress in Haiti (FRAPH)  convicted of involvementin the 1994 Raboteau massacre  has all the elements ofpolitical motivation.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  with itsCARICOM partners  is anxious to welcome Haiti backinto the organs of our regional body. But it would be abetrayal of all that we hold dear to ignore theinterruption of democracy  the abuses of human rightsand the breakdown of law and order merely to appeaseperfidious power. We support the work of the UnitedNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) while believing that the United Nations forces haveneither the manpower nor the resources required toperform the miracle that they have been entrusted toconjure.From time to time  one or more of our traditionalfriends and allies have shown displeasure at one ormore of our decisions in the field of internationalrelations. Some appear not to appreciate the necessityand desirability of small States  such as Saint Vincentand the Grenadines  seeking  and oft-times finding more economic and political space to enhance theircapacity to address more efficaciously the harsh windsfrom the external political economy and to do so in theinterest of our people’s humanization. No one hasanything to fear from us. None of our friends canreasonably ask us to adopt their enemies as our own. Itis part of our quest to get adversaries to speak sensiblyto one another and resolve their differences particularly if they are our neighbours. We pick fightswith no one; and we do not pick other people’s fights.One of the best and most loyal friends over ourcountry’s 25 years of independence has been theRepublic of China on Taiwan. Our relationship hasbeen exemplary and is characterized by mutual respect solidarity and a desire for international peace  inaccordance with the principles enshrined in the Charterof the United Nations. Taiwan  a magnificent politicalexpression of the Chinese civilization  has partneredbeautifully with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  acomponent of our Caribbean civilization. Weunequivocally support the quest of Taiwan to berepresented at the United Nations and otherinternational bodies. It is unfair  unreasonable andirrational to exclude a country of 23 million persons with a thriving economy and a nobility of purpose from the United Nations. Further  we urge the UnitedNations to take the lead in promoting constructivedialogue and friendly engagement between thePeople’s Republic of China and the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan. Bellicose conduct across the Taiwan Straitcannot be condoned in a world striving for enhancedpeace and collective security.Let me end by expressing the hope that theUnited Nations may achieve  in the next 60 years greater and greater success in its goals of bringinghope to the hopeless  providing food for the hungry15and spreading peace  stability and sustainability fornow and forever. Let this not be the road less travelled."
"177",7373,"VEN",60,2005,"At the end of the first five years of the thirdmillennium  this Organization must go through a phaseof maturity after sixty years of life  enough time tohave formed a collective understanding of the majorproblems still facing mankind and to find the mosteffective ways to address them. Recent facts show thatthis is the reality that we shall have to deal with forsome time in the future.There are many challenges facing the UnitedNations  both internal and global problems. By way ofillustration  I should like to refer to two of thosechallenges: one internal  namely  the much-neededdemocratization of this Organization and the otherexternal  the problem of poverty  which is the mostimportant  growing and alarming problem of36contemporary society. I should like to invite alldelegations to give these two problems careful thought.Democracy  at the current stage of humandevelopment  is the highest form of politicalorganization. Democracy  owing to its very nature andas a vital condition  implies the equal exercise of rightsas the ideal way to reach the best possible livingconditions. What is valid for one country takenindividually applies even more to organizations inwhich many sovereign nations are represented  all withequal rights.The United Nations is the most emblematic casein the modern society of nations. As a result  it shouldbe the true embodiment and example of the equalexercise of democratic rights. If we agree on this basicprinciple  one question immediately comes to mind: isthis Organization a democratic institution? Are itspractices useful  as we have seen in very recentdecisions adopted by a small number of Members in adocument presented in the first meeting? Is this auseful example of a transparent democratic exercise onthe part of the sovereign nations represented here?The answer  regrettably  is a resounding “no”. Onthe contrary  what we have seen is a dangerous processin which oligarchies are being built  where a smallgroup of countries usurp the right to take decisionswithout taking into account the vast majority ofcountries that ultimately represent the overwhelmingmajority of the global population. This is what usuallyhappens with matters affecting the fate of billions ofhuman beings.For those reasons  when we talk about reform  thefirst thing to do is to define the nature of this reform which can have no other goal than the democratizationof this Organization. That means giving decision-making power in fundamental matters to the GeneralAssembly and ending once and for all theOrganization’s oligarchic and  very often  autocraticpractices  which diminish its authority in the eyes ofthe world.In our humble but firm opinion  this is the majorchallenge the Organization faces internally. Its veryexistence depends on the successful resolution of thisissue. We have no doubt about that  and let us notdoubt it.In the external sphere  the most importantchallenge lies in the agonizing escalation that dailytraps millions of human beings living in poverty.Poverty — as we have heard here in many statements —is the result of an unjust system of distribution of theearthly goods of men that therefore denies men anyspiritual value. It is an unfair system of distributionthat stems from a distorted matrix whose dominantforce is a ruthless thirst for profit and in whichgrowing wealth is based on the expansion anddeepening of poverty. This is the reality that we seeday after day  not only  to the surprise of many  in theso-called poor countries  but also in countries whereopulence is obscenely on display  every second through the mass media  attracting millions of peoplewho are trying to improve their living conditions  onlyto crash into a wall raised by those who preach marketfreedom and the free movement of capital but who donot tolerate the movement of human beings exceptwhen they are needed as a labour force to furtherexpand their wealth.This is the painful truth that the tragedy ofKatrina has revealed. It is a painful reality that hasprofoundly shaken all of those for whom nothing abouthuman beings is strange  wherever it may occur.These problems should have become the focalpoints of the entire document that was approved in astrange “consensus” — a word I do not hesitate toplace between quotation marks. Little attention hasbeen paid to this drama. But the drama is there; it isboiling across the world. That generates instability because if there is one thing that human society is notmade for  it is suicide. It seeks desperate forms ofsurvival  and that is why  as the great Peruvian CesarVallejo said once  it lights its captive torch and praysangrily. These are days of suffering but also days ofanger in many parts of the world  and that generatesinstability. If we want stability in the world  let usapply social justice  a new system of distributionamong regions and a new system of solidarity fordistribution within nations that cannot be limited tocharity or assistance often delivered under humiliatingconditions.There are many ideas that bring us to thismeeting  I am sure. On some of the most importantproblems we have already defined our position inprevious statements. We will continue doing so in thissession. For the time being  we would simply add abasic item: how difficult it is to realize man’sdemocratic dream when man finds himself preventedfrom satisfying his most basic conditions for a life of37dignity: health  nutrition  a roof over his head and theopportunity to enjoy basic rights.We trust in the wisdom of the peoples and thenew leadership that through its voice speaks for silentmillions. We trust in the struggle of those who  as thegreat Martí said  have thrown in their lot with the poorof the earth. Thus some day  in the not-so-distantfuture  we will find ourselves in a better world  with alife worth living and a United Nations strengthened bythe essential values of men and women of dignity  whoare the majority on this planet."
"178",7412,"VNM",60,2005,"At the outset  Iwould like  on behalf of the Vietnamese delegation sincerely to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson on hiselection as President of the General Assembly at itssixtieth session. I am convinced that under his ablestewardship this session will be crowned with success.Let me express our deep appreciation for thecontributions made by his predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping to the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his greatefforts over the past year to reform and strengthen ourOrganization.Taking place in the context of the many activitiescommemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the UnitedNations — especially the High-level Plenary Meetingof the General Assembly that just concluded — thepresent session constitutes an event of crucialsignificance that offers us a great deal of hope andconfidence. We believe that Member States will be ableto work out effective ways in which to implement thecommitments contained in the outcome document(resolution 60/1) just adopted by our leaders  especiallythose concerning the implementation of theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). We areconfident that  amid both challenges and opportunitiesand with the necessary wisdom and determination  wewill find the right path towards a brighter future forhumanity in the twenty-first century.In today’s celebratory atmosphere  we cannot andshould not forget stark realities as we continue to seethe spread of war and conflict  the resurgence ofterrorism  natural disasters  poverty  the outbreak ofepidemics and transnational crime  which arethreatening the peace  security  independence andprosperity of nations. The people of the world wereshocked by the recent terrorist attacks in London  inSharm el-Sheikh and elsewhere. Viet Nam thereforejoins with others in the fight against terrorism of all21kinds. It is our view that  in order to root out terrorism the international community must seriously andadequately address the phenomena of poverty  injusticeand inequality.Viet Nam welcomes the recent positivedevelopments in the Middle East peace process. It isour consistent policy to support the just cause of thePalestinian people in their struggle for their inalienablerights. In that connection  we welcome Israel’swithdrawal from resettlement areas in the Gaza Strip.Proceeding from its principled position thatinternational disputes should be settled by peacefulmeans  Viet Nam supports peaceful solutions to thenuclear issue in Iran and on the Korean peninsula.Considering embargoes and blockades to beunacceptable in the modern world  we call for the earlylifting of the unilateral embargo against Cuba. It is VietNam’s view that the United Nations should be moreactive in that connection.The tsunami that affected Asian countries lastyear and Hurricane Katrina  which hit coastal cities ofthe United States  both resulting in the loss of a greatnumber of lives and damage worth hundreds of billionsof dollars  are reminders of the need for effective earlywarning systems  preparedness and internationalsolidarity in confronting the forces of nature.As we are preparing to translate the commitmentscontained in the outcome document into action toreform the United Nations  I would like to associatemyself with the views expressed by the Secretary-General in his report “In larger freedom” (A/59/2005)and reaffirmed in the outcome document concerningthe interactive links among peace  security development and human rights. Viet Nam’s experienceshows that an environment of peace and political andsocial stability is indispensable for development andthat economic growth  the improvement of people’slives  will help to strengthen peace and stability. In thatregard  we believe the United Nations should play agreater role in making those links more interactive.Viet Nam shares the common view that reform ofthe United Nations should aim  first and foremost  atenhancing the Organization’s efficiency and democracyon the basis of strengthening the fundamentalprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter. It isessential to reinforce the central role and power of theGeneral Assembly  a body that stipulates the equalparticipation of all United Nations Members. Reformof the Security Council should be accorded adequateattention  so that the Council can be turned into a bodythat is able to perform its functions in maintaininginternational peace and security effectively. TheCouncil’s working methods should be improved toensure democracy and transparency. The Council needsto be enlarged in both categories of its membership inorder to ensure that it truly represents all UnitedNations Members  as stipulated in the Charter. Webelieve that developing States should be moreadequately represented in that important organ. Wewould like to reiterate the support we have expressedsince 1999 for India  Japan and Germany as permanentmembers of an expanded Council.Furthermore  Viet Nam believes that reform ofthe United Nations must be carried outcomprehensively and in a way that ensures a balancebetween the two equally important and mutuallycomplementary goals of maintaining peace andsecurity and promoting development. An enablingenvironment for development must be built on thebasis of equitable international economic relations mutual benefit  shared responsibility and the fulfilmentof agreed commitments.In that spirit  Viet Nam supports the proposals ondevelopment set out in the report of the Secretary-General and the commitments contained in theoutcome document  especially the recommitment of theinternational community to achieving the MDGs onschedule. Viet Nam welcomes the commitment on thepart of some developed countries to allocate 0.7 percent of their gross national income to officialdevelopment assistance without any conditions. Ifdeveloping nations are to achieve the MDGs  it isessential that they be enabled to participate moreactively in the global economy. Viet Nam thereforecalls on the United Nations to adopt and implementmeasures to facilitate the entry of developing countriesinto the World Trade Organization. Moreover  non-tariff and other protective measures aimed at blockingexports from developing countries  under such pretextsas sanitary and phytosanitary standards  should bedismantled.Guaranteeing and promoting human rights alwaysremain high priorities in the work of the UnitedNations. Viet Nam supports a greater role for theOrganization in that regard. We will continue to spareno effort in contributing to the common cause of22human rights protection. Mindful of the need to reformthe United Nations machinery for protecting humanrights  we believe that reform must be conducted in amanner that is free from acts of politicization. Morein-depth discussions are needed with regard to theissue of establishing a Human Rights Council and theconcept of the responsibility to protect  so as to ensurebroad support for the measures to be implemented.The Vietnamese people have just celebrated thesixtieth anniversary of the founding of their democraticState. Having gone through a process of comprehensiverenewal  Viet Nam today is a country with high andsustained economic growth and social equity  and wehave made significant progress in implementing theMDGs. Today  Viet Nam is a safe and stable countrythat has further integrated into the global economy andhas pursued a foreign policy of independence sovereignty and diversification  strengtheningmultilateral ties in its external relations. It is a countrythat is willing to be a friend and a reliable partner of allcountries of the world community.We have actively participated in various regional interregional and global cooperation arrangements.Viet Nam has been making great efforts to concludenegotiations for its early accession to the World TradeOrganization. I would like to take this opportunity toextend our thanks to those countries that havesupported Viet Nam in that connection. We are activelyengaged in the cooperation activities of the Associationof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation (APEC)  as well as withASEAN cooperation with East Asia. To make a greatercontribution to the work of the United Nations  VietNam has decided to present its candidacy for anon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the2008-2009 term. We are now actively preparing toparticipate in United Nations peacekeeping operationswhen conditions are ripe.To conclude  let me assure the Assembly that VietNam will continue to work closely with other countriesin the international community to strive for ourcommon goals  among them a stronger United Nations."
"179",7443,"VUT",60,2005,"I bring warm greetingsfrom the people of the Republic of Vanuatu.At the outset  I wish to congratulate you  Sir  onyour assumption of the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its sixtieth session. I assure you of myGovernment’s support for the work of the UnitedNations under your stewardship. I take this opportunityalso to acknowledge  with deep admiration  the sterlingdedication of your predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  whometiculously steered the work of the fifty-ninth sessionto its conclusion. I would like also to pay tribute to theSecretary-General for his active role and for hisresilience in continuing the work of United Nationsreform.We come to the Assembly annually to reaffirmour faith and confidence in the purposes and principlesof the Charter. This year is especially important  sinceleaders are meeting five years after the MillenniumSummit to take stock of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals (MDGs). Although the outcome document hasbeen adopted  we are extremely disappointed with theomission of numerous paragraphs. The farcical endingof the negotiations resulted in a dilution of the qualityof the final document. The United Nations must  infuture  avoid becoming a rubber stamp for thepowerful.The world is at a crossroads. Our meeting istaking place at a critical juncture. Civil and politicalstrife  wars  poverty  diseases  famine  drought  naturaldisasters  terrorism  minority oppression andenvironmental degradation are affecting the lives ofmillions of people. The sacrilege of such humansuffering is unbelievable and painful to bear.The United Nations must be able to do more andmust respond more promptly to such situations. It mustdo so by improving its preventive-capacitymechanisms so as to minimize the devastating impacton peoples’ livelihood and to ease their suffering.We must ask  therefore  whether we are reallydoing enough for our peoples. Is this all aboutimpressive speeches  rhetoric and pretentious grandiose plans that detract from the real issues thatneed addressing? My Government is disillusioned bythe lack of genuine goodwill and support that is beingoffered to the United Nations.I would like to reiterate my Government’smessage to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession.“The Achilles heel of the current structure is theimbalance of power in the United Nations system.It has become so chronic that it has weakened2the multilateral focus  cohesiveness andinternationalism of the United Nations.”(A/59/PV.14  p. 25)The principles of democratization and goodgovernance  so actively advocated and championed bysome Members  must be reflected in the reorganizationand decision-making process of the United Nationssystem.If we are to get back on track  the United Nationsmust be rejuvenated. It must be reinvigorated so that itcan reassume its legitimate and central responsibility inaddressing the causes of conflict  maintaining peaceand security and promoting the development agenda.But if it is to do that  the Organization’s decision-making and other processes must be transparent andtruly democratized. Some of us preach strongly ondemocracy the world over  yet are unable to practiceand enforce those values when it really matters. We arenow on the threshold of a new beginning  so let us notallow this new opportunity to pass.At the summit  I said that tolerance and respectmust form the nucleus for any reform of the UnitedNations. Only by enforcing those values will we cometo realize the true meaning of justice  equality andhuman rights. The diversity of the developing worldpresents huge challenges for us all. However  thestrong nations must be able to muster the political willto effect changes. The big players need to transformtheir philosophy and their mindset  because they havebeen hindrances to the creation of an equitable systemof good governance within multilateral organizationssuch as the United Nations.The United Nations remains indispensable forfuture peace and prosperity. Globalization has broughtnations together; we are interlinked andinterdependent  and that requires global cooperationand governance from all responsible Members of theOrganization. Understandably  there are vestedinterests held by the powerful. That requires genuinecooperation and goodwill  and those interests and therole of the United Nations must converge in order toensure compatibility with the international legalframework.My Government fully supports efforts to reformthe United Nations system so as to ensure a strongerand more effective Organization. In this context  mydelegation shares the views of other delegations on theneed to revise the membership of the Security Councilso as to ensure fair representation of Member Stateswithout affecting the authority of the Council. A morerepresentative Council will bring openness andtransparency  create confidence and improveunderstanding and cooperation. The restructuring ofthe Security Council membership is long overdue.Diversity is essential in that respect.I agree that terrorism is one of three mainscourges confronting humankind today — the othersbeing poverty and disease. My Government condemnsthose deliberate callous and inhuman acts that havetaken the lives of innocent people. There is no just actof terrorism. We agree that we must work collectivelyin eliminating that deadly menace from the face of theEarth. But the fight against terrorism must be balancedand targeted so as to ensure that resources are equitablychannelled into meeting the Millennium DevelopmentGoals.The global economic situation todaydiscriminates against many of the developingeconomies. Unfair trading practices and the impositionof intrusive policies on national economies affect oureconomies by opening them up to unfavourableconditions that only favour the stronger nations. Suchnegative actions marginalize nations and peoples.Marginalization then breeds and incites resentment fuelling the hatred that eventually creates fertilegrounds for extremism to grow and flourish.We have agreed on the establishment of thePeacebuilding Commission  which will also enablemore work to be done to combat the spread ofterrorism  in particular by identifying areas whereinternational support and understanding are required.Although we are injecting many resources into curingthe problem  we are not really preventing it fromemerging. The world needs a spirit of pacifism if realpeace is to prevail. In order to achieve that  the UnitedNations needs moral leadership — leadership thatfocuses on security and dignity for the human person.The post-Monterrey Conference era posesextreme challenges for the economic survival andsocio-economic stability of many of the small islanddeveloping nations like Vanuatu. We urge ourdevelopment partners to honour their commitments toreach the 0.7 per cent target for official developmentassistance (ODA). In this context we welcome thecommitments from the United States of Americathrough the Millennium Challenge Account. We also3welcome commitments by Qatar  the European Unionand the People’s Republic of China. Furthermore  welook forward to the coming to fruition of initiatives byFrance and other countries.The pivotal role of trade as the engine foreconomic growth cannot be overemphasized  but  asmany of my colleagues from the small island Statesand the least developed countries have stated  marketaccess and special preferential treatment must beprovided.Furthermore  many of us are restricted byinflexible and immoral conditions that inhibit newfinancing and development initiatives. We continue tocall for trade and investment and labour export to helpour economies to grow.My Government’s national development prioritiesfocus on building the productive sector. TheGovernment’s prioritized action agenda highlights thepolicy areas that we believe to be essential in meetingour development objectives. It is the catalyst forVanuatu’s medium- to long-term strategic planning which emphasizes the need to empower our ruralpopulation through infrastructure- and capacity-building initiatives. The development policyframework is consistent with achieving the MDGtargets  and the development strategy is being refinedto give equal consideration to our other internationalcommitments and the Pacific Plan. We appeal to ourdevelopment partners to assist us in the effectiveimplementation of our strategy.A fundamental lesson to be drawn from Vanuatu’sreforms is that they have been forced from outside without being adapted to our national circumstances.From Vanuatu’s perspective  externally driven reformsmust be buttressed by an equal partnership thatrespects local traditions and cultures and the rights ofall citizens  without disturbing the essential unitingmechanisms of society that have successfully held ustogether. Vanuatu embraces democracy and theconcepts of good governance and transparency  butthose far-reaching principles must be tailored totraditional systems without affecting their relevanceand significance.With regard to the environment  we urge ourdevelopment partners to actively support the effectiveimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy. Thechallenges confronting island States are ominous  and Irepeat the call that more recognition should be given toaccommodate our natural characteristics andvulnerabilities. We also urge States that have not yetdone so to act responsibly by ratifying the KyotoProtocol as soon as possible.On the question of the shipment of radioactivematerials and hazardous waste  improvements insafeguards and assurances should not have to await acalamity. Preventive measures must be the course ofaction to take. The risks posed by the forces of nature coupled with increased terrorist activities  are toograve for enhanced safeguards to deal with. The worldwould be better off banning such shipments rather thanendlessly trying to perfect safeguards approaches that at best  only limit such serious risks. Complacencywould be our greatest mistake.The Charter of the United Nations espouses theprinciples that continue to guide the Organization’sefforts in the process of self-determination. That rightmust be progressively advanced. The United Nationsmust be consistent and not lose sight of thefundamental right of self-determination for those whoare working their way out of the shackles of colonialrule. Ruling and sovereign authorities must ensure thatthe process remains on track.Where the United Nations has failed to fullycomply with the appropriate legal procedures  it is onlyproper that such instances be adequately addressed toallow justice to prevail for the victims. Circumventingthe issue only exposes the dark history and raisesserious questions about the credibility  relevance andintegrity of the United Nations. Only in an open andconsistent manner can we redress past failures andprovide a stronger basis for the advancement of UnitedNations ideals.Such contradictions simply make a mockery ofthe fundamental principles of human rights and self-determination clearly enshrined in the Charter of theUnited Nations. How can we call for respect for humanrights  yet blatantly ignore the pleas of the millionscalling out for justice? The United Nations cannot  andmust not  continue to turn a blind eye to its own pastfailures. It is morally  politically and legally wrong todo so.The continuing disputes raised over theimplementation of United Nations resolutions are clear4examples challenging the integrity and validity of theUnited Nations. We cannot ignore the calls of the WestPapuans in their quest for justice. We urge the UnitedNations to act responsibly in revisiting the case of WestPapua. However  we are encouraged by the IndonesianGovernment’s efforts to address alleged human rightsabuses. We also welcome decisions empowering WestPapuans to manage their own affairs in collaborationwith the central Government.The United Nations must also explore variousavenues to end the economic embargo imposed onCuba. Countless resolutions have been adopted to noeffect  and the Cuban people continue to bemarginalized in the multilateral trading system. This isa critically challenging responsibility. Some may see itas an improbable task  but it must be addressed withgenuine support and goodwill on the part of therelevant authorities and sovereign States.In conclusion  I hope that the Creator’s wisdomwill prevail as we continue our journey. Despite all ourdifferences and diversities  human security for all isour main goal and should remain the focus of theUnited Nations agenda. The cardinal question is  willMembers allow the United Nations to undertakeserious reforms in meeting the challenges ahead? Andwill the Organization be capable of guaranteeing afuture of peace and prosperity that is not reserved onlyfor the big players but will be enjoyed by all? Will theUnited Nations become a juggernaut for the strongernations? A famous biblical verse reminds us about thefundamental wisdom of building on rock instead ofsand. The future remains in our hands  and theRepublic of Vanuatu will play its part.May our beloved almighty Creator bless us all."
"180",7475,"WSM",60,2005,"Samoa warmlycongratulates you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at this historicmoment — a very challenging time. Samoa pledges toyou and to Sweden its full support and cooperationthroughout the sixtieth session of the GeneralAssembly.I also want to pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Jean Ping of the Gabonese Republic  for hisoutstanding service and effective guidance during thefifty-ninth session.Just a few days ago in this very Hall  we met totake stock of progress and map the way forward in theimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs). The MDGs are not merely a set of targets  butencompass a process which addresses the variedchallenges to human development. While someprogress has been made over the past five years  muchmore remains to be done.It is therefore imperative that concerted globalefforts be strengthened  in terms of politicalcommitment and resource mobilization  if the outcomeof the summit envisaged in the summit outcomedocument is to be achieved.Samoa is progressing well towards achieving theMDGs by the target period of 2015. Challengesremain  however  and they are being addressed throughlegislative and policy initiatives and the creation ofinnovative partnerships with the donor community andcivil society.Samoa reiterates its support for the ongoingefforts to modernize and strengthen the United Nations.We thank the previous President of the Assembly  aswell as the Secretary-General  for their laudable workand tireless efforts in advancing the reform andrevitalization of the Organization.It is our belief that reform measures must providefor a transparent  democratic and expanded SecurityCouncil  in both the permanent and non-permanentmembership categories  and for an effective andstrengthened Organization that reflects the realities ofthe twenty-first century. Substantive changes aretherefore required with regard to both the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council  as well as to otherbodies of the United Nations system.We congratulate President Ping  in particular forhis stewardship and leadership throughout thenegotiations for and the adoption of the summitdeclaration last week. This is the sixtieth anniversaryof the United Nations; the time is surely ripe now toimplement the reforms needed to revitalize ourOrganization and enable it to effectively realize theprinciples and goals identified in the declaration.The courageous efforts of the Israeli andPalestinian authorities to find a sustainable peacesolution deserve our applause and prayers forcontinuing success. While there have been positivedevelopments in the Middle East  the violence and acts7of terrorism in Iraq and in other parts of the regionremain causes for grave concern.Terrorism  perpetrated by those with no respectfor human decency and life  continues to plague ourworld. No cause or grievances can justify acts that killand maim innocent people. Heinous and murderousacts of terrorism serve only the purposes of those whowant to destabilize society and usher in a dark age forour world. Samoa therefore condemns terrorism in allits forms in the strongest terms and will continue tosupport the international campaign to overcome thatscourge to human dignity and security.The peacekeeping and security advocacy work ofthe United Nations around the world has our fullsupport. Samoa presently has police contingentsserving with peacekeeping missions in Timor-Lesteand in Liberia. Within our Pacific region  Samoa alsocontributes police support to the Regional AssistanceMission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) under theauspices of the Pacific Islands Forum. RAMSIconforms to its regional responsibilities under ChapterVIII of the United Nations Charter and recognizes thesovereignty of the Solomon Islands.Samoa is pleased to note that the membership ofthe International Criminal Court will soon number 100.Samoa adds its voice to the appeal for the earlyratification of and accession to the Rome Statuteestablishing the Court by those States that have not yetdone so. The Court brings to justice those who commitgenocide  crimes against humanity and war crimes andis therefore an important institution in upholdinginternational humanitarian standards and the protectionof human rights. For those reasons  it would be amistake to undermine the effectiveness of the Court inany way. Instead  the Court should be given thenecessary support to give it universality.Samoa remains extremely concerned about theproliferation of nuclear weapons and their threat  notjust to international peace and security  but to the veryexistence of life on our planet. We regret deeply thatthe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  held in May2005  was unable to agree on steps to strengthen thenon-proliferation regime. The Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) arethe main instruments for controlling the spread ofnuclear weapons.The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treatyhighlights the seriousness with which the issue of thethreat of nuclear weapons is viewed in our region andwe call on States who have not done so to ratify theTreaty’s Protocols. Clearly  adherence to therequirements of the NPT  the CTBT and otherconventions on disarmament is vital. Samoa thereforejoins the call for all United Nations Members to signon to those treaties and for States parties to honourtheir obligations to them.Small arms and light weapons have been usedtime and again in violent conflict  contributing to thedestabilization and devastation of communities inmany countries  including in the Pacific. Theproliferation of small weapons is a major problem. Wetherefore fully support the holding of a reviewconference on small arms next year  in particular with aview to concluding a treaty to control the trade in smallarms and stop them from reaching areas of violentconflict.As the current Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum I wish to report that since the General Assemblysession last year new and positive developments havetaken place in the Pacific region. The programme ofPacific Regional Assistance to Nauru  a regionalresponse to assist Nauru rebuild its economy  is inprogress. With assistance from the United Nations  anautonomous government is now being established inBougainville. I am also pleased to announce that thePacific Plan — a road map to further strengthenregional cooperation and integration to achieve ourregion’s priority goals of economic growth  sustainabledevelopment  good governance and security — isnearing completion and is expected to be consideredand approved by Pacific Forum leaders at their nextsummit  in Papua New Guinea  in October of this year.The Pacific Plan will also improve Pacific countries’capacities to achieve the Millennium DevelopmentGoals.The Mauritius Strategy for the FurtherImplementation of the Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  adopted in January 2005  sets out long-termaction plans for the sustainable development of smallisland developing States (SIDS). While we accept thatthe primary responsibility for the implementation ofthe Mauritius Strategy lies with us  there is still acritical need for the sustained and long-termcommitment of our partners to focus on the special8case of SIDS and to take their specific vulnerabilities and the challenges generated thereby  into account. Wetherefore call on the United Nations system and theinternational community to provide the necessarysupport to implement and monitor the MauritiusStrategy.As has often been repeated from this rostrum trade is the surest path to greater wealth and a vitalcomponent of sustainable development for SIDS. Wetherefore support the successful conclusion of the DohaRound  which took the vulnerabilities of small Statesfully into account in the negotiations  particularly withregard to special and preferential treatment for smalleconomies.Let me conclude by reaffirming Samoa’scommitment to multilateralism and to the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations."
"181",7521,"YEM",60,2005,"TheGovernment of the Republic of Yemen believes that theprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations formthe cornerstone of its ability to tackle all problems atthe national  regional and international levels. Eversince it was created  it has strived to create a climate ofsecurity and stability in the region by demarcatingYemen’s land and sea borders by peaceful means andby its devotion to the principle of well-balanceddiplomacy and dialogue in the settlement of itsdisputes with others. It has fostered a partnership withneighbouring countries of the Gulf CooperationCouncil and the San’a community for development  aswell as its active contribution to the League of ArabStates.Yemen has played a pioneering role with regardto political reform and the multiparty system and hasenabled women to participate actively in the political economic and social life of the country. Yemen is in theprocess of preparing for direct presidential elections  aswell as elections for local administrative councils  inorder to enhance democracy and promote people’sparticipation in the administration of the country and inachieving decentralization by next September.24Yemen would like to thank the internationaldevelopment agency for its support in this connection as well as those States that have supported ourdemocracy. We hope  however  that we will bereceiving more financial and technical support for thehigh electoral commission to enable it to efficientlycarry out its work.In light of terrorist acts in a number of countriesof the region and throughout the world  the Republic ofYemen wishes to reaffirm its clear-cut position thatthere is a need to have joint responsibility in ourstruggle against terrorism. We will cooperate with allStates and international organizations to deal with thisdanger and to develop ways for exchanginginformation  particularly with regard to the sources offinancing for terrorism and the prosecution of theguilty parties. We firmly believe that we shouldconvene an international conference on terrorism toarrive at a clear definition of the phenomenon  whichwould draw a distinction between terrorism and theright of peoples to self-determination and to resistforeign occupation of their territories. We alsocondemn all forms of terrorism against innocent anddefenceless civilians.The expansion of poverty and diseases and thelack of education and health services for millions ofpeople in Africa and Asia constitutes a time bombthreatening international peace and security.Establishing peace and stability and putting an end toextremism and terrorism are goals that cannot beachieved unless rich States revise their economic andpolitical policies and provide support to achieve peaceand development. That would enable millions ofpeople to recover their dignity and humanity. In thiscontext  the Republic of Yemen wishes to reaffirm itssupport for the proposal made by the King of SaudiArabia  Guardian of the Two Holy Sites  for thecreation of an international centre to fight terrorism.The Republic of Yemen is of the view that thewithdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from the GazaStrip is a first step on a long path. We reaffirm ourbelief that this withdrawal is but a part of the road mapthat should be considered as an integratedcomprehensive plan that must be implemented as awhole and not dealt with selectively.In this context  the international communityshould not be deceived into believing that Israel hasmade enormous sacrifices by withdrawing fromterritories occupied by force  or have any sympathy forIsraeli settlers who were evacuated  as thesesettlements were built on land the settlers did not own.Israel should end its occupation of the West Bank remove all settlements there  and demolish theseparation wall in accordance with the advisoryopinion of the International Court of Justice.The peace process is an indivisible whole. Realpeace can only be achieved when all Arab rights havebeen recovered — first and foremost  the withdrawal ofIsrael from all occupied territories in Palestine  theGolan Heights and southern Lebanon to the borders of4 June 1967  the creation of an independent PalestinianState on Palestinian national soil with its capital inAl-Quds Al-Sharif  and the just resolution of therefugee problem in accordance with General Assemblyresolution 194 (III) of 1949. We ask the internationalOrganization and the Quartet not to recognize noraccept any Israeli guarantees or promises that aredesigned to violate the legitimate rights of thePalestinian people and its sovereignty and not toreward Israeli occupation that seeks to impose faitsaccomplis solutions.We must carefully consider the situation in Iraqand see what we can do to assist the Iraqi people toachieve its aspirations. There is no doubt that respectfor the unity  sovereignty and independence of Iraq non-interference in its internal affairs  respect for thewill of the people of Iraq and their choices indetermining their future  are important tasks that thisinternational Organization  as well as the internationalcommunity  must help and support. The same is truewith regard to the need for all sectors of Iraqi societyto take part in the political process on the basis ofconciliation and national harmony  withoutjeopardizing Iraq’s Arab identity  civilization andheritage. In this context  the people and Government ofYemen welcome the positive and important role takenby the United Nations in support of the constructivepolitical process. It is important for this internationalOrganization to play a central role in order to helpcomplete this process and that of the reconstruction ofIraq.In the same vein  I reiterate the need to urgentlyimplement Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) inorder to allow Iraq to recover its full sovereignty andto put an end to the foreign military presence in thatcountry.25The Republic of Yemen is following withsatisfaction the positive events that are occurring inSudan  which we see as the beginning of a new stage ofnational reconciliation  peace and stability in the entirecountry and as the end of the longest conflict in Africa.We appreciate the role played by neighbouring Araband African States  as well as that by Secretary-General Kofi Annan  for their help in achievingagreement to ensure Sudan’s territorial integrity  unity stability and security. We hope that the internationalOrganization will redouble its efforts to make sure thatinternational financial institutions  funds and Statessupport the process of peace  development andreconstruction throughout Sudan  particularly in theregions that have been ravaged by war.We are pleased to see progress achieved inSomalia. However  we warn of the possibility offurther setbacks in that country. We have no choice butto call upon the United Nations and the internationalcommunity as a whole to provide urgently neededassistance to the transitional Government in Somalia toenable the Government to carry out its work particularly with regard to ensuring reconstruction andthe rule of law. The participation of United Nationspeacekeeping forces has become more necessary nowthan ever before. Any reluctance in providing suchassistance to Somalia will mean that terrorism and theforces of violence and extremism will prevail withmost serious consequences to that country  to the Arabworld  regionally and internationally.With regard to my country’s position ondeveloping national capabilities in the area of thepeaceful use of nuclear energy  we believe that allmember States of the International Atomic EnergyAgency have the right to develop their nuclearcapabilities for peaceful purposes  a position that wasadopted by the Islamic States at the meeting of foreignministers of the Organization of the IslamicConference  held in Sana’a last June.We further reaffirm the importance of making theMiddle East a zone free of nuclear weapons andweapons of mass destruction and that the prohibition ofsuch weapons should apply to all States of the region including Israel.In conclusion  allow me once more tocongratulate you  Mr. President  and express my bestwishes to the General Assembly  hoping that ourcommon endeavour will be crowned with success sothat we can achieve peace  security and prosperity foreveryone."
"182",7559,"YUG",60,2005,"Seven days ago  from this rostrum  Iwarned that the situation in Kosovo and Metohija - aprovince of Serbia administered by the United Nationssince 10 June 1999 - poses a serious threat to the20stability of the Balkans. Serbia and Montenegrosupports the conclusion of the International ContactGroup that there will be no return to the situationbefore 10 June 1999.I would like to recall that  before 1999  theregime in Serbia insisted on the limited autonomy ofKosovo  while the Albanian political leaders insistedon its independence. Those two opposing positions ledto an armed conflict  and later to NATO air strikesagainst Serbia and Montenegro. That conflict endedfollowing the adoption of Security Council resolution1244 (1999)  which called for a protectorate in Kosovobut did not call into question the territorial integrity ofSerbia and Montenegro.The Contact Group's conclusion that there will beno return to the situation before June 1999 has to applyequally to both sides - Serbian and Albanian.Consequently  there can be neither limited autonomynor independence for Kosovo. By proposing a statusthat was greater than autonomy but less thanindependence for Kosovo  the democratic Governmentin Belgrade demonstrated its full commitment toreaching a compromise solution. Unfortunately  theKosovo Albanians  only interested in independence have not budged an inch from their 1999 position.Unfortunately  I have to note that theinternational community is partly to blame for thetragic position the Serbian and other non-Albanianminorities in Kosovo find themselves in  as well as forthe political extremism of the Albanian majority andthe many crimes that have been committed. Thestandards set for Kosovo are not even close to beingfulfilled. Are we therefore going to abandon theìStandards before Statusî policy? From 10 June 1999to the present  approximately 200 000 Serbs andMontenegrins  as well as Turks  Croats  Roma  Jewsand other non-Albanians  have been expelled fromKosovo. Close to 80 per cent of the territory is nowinhabited only by Albanians. Several hundred Serbshave been killed  including many children.Approximately 40 000 Serbian homes have beendemolished or set on fire  as well as 150 churches andmonasteries that were centuries old. The remainingSerbs and other non-Albanians live in so-calledenclaves  without guarantees for their personal safetyand their freedom of movement. No one in present-dayEurope is so tragically unprotected.In spite the foregoing  we hope that the UnitedNations military and police forces will remain inKosovo. Without their presence  the tragedy of Serbsand other minorities would be complete. Troops fromthe United States  Italy  France and other countriesshould be given credit for keeping the SerbianChristian monasteries designated or nominated asinternational world heritage sites from being blown upor set on fire. We would like to thank the UnitedNations and ask the United Nations forces to stay inKosovo as long as necessary.For months now  Albanian extremists have beenopenly threatening to launch a pogrom against theremaining Serbs  Montenegrins and othernon-Albanians - and even against United Nationsforces - unless Kosovo's independence is proclaimed.Recent killings of young Serbs announced thebeginning of that scenario. Ultimatums and threats tocommit crimes and terrorism cannot be acceptedanywhere in the world  including in Kosovo. I hopethat that will finally and decisively be made clear tothe Albanian majority in the province. Serbia andMontenegro demands a European level of human rightsprotection for national communities in Kosovo protection of churches and monasteries and recognitionof the European status of the existing State borderswith the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic ofAlbania. No more and no less is acceptable  eitherunder the Charter of the United Nations or underSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999). Our rights donot threaten any right of the Albanian majority. Anindependent State of Kosovo is not a guaranteed right but an extreme demand.We are truly and fully committed to acompromise  but compromise does not mean that oneside gets everything while the other side gets nothing.We are for reconciliation and a common Europeanfuture  in which Serbs  Montenegrins and Albanianswill be good neighbours and best friends for eachother.A stable and European Kosovo means a stableWestern Balkans region  and vice versa. The choice isobvious."
"183",7587,"ZAF",60,2005,"First  I would like to saluteMr. Jean Ping  the outgoing President of the GeneralAssembly  for the work he did to guide the GeneralAssembly as the nations of the world considered theimmensely important matters that led to the elaborationof the outcome document that was adopted last night.I would also like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to preside over the sixtieth session of theGeneral Assembly. We are confident that you will leadthe Assembly well as it confronts the challenge ofimplementing the decisions taken during themillennium review summit and remains seized of otherimportant matters that were not adequately addressedin the outcome document.Shortly before we convened here for themillennium review summit  an important meeting ofChristian leaders took place in Washington  D.C. Thoseleaders issued a communique entitled ìA Call toPartnershipî  directed at our summit meeting. In partthe call says ""At the urgent call of church leaders in thesouthern hemisphere  we came together at theWashington National Cathedral as Christianleaders from diverse traditions and places  bothrich and poor  in the South and the North  unitedin a common concern for those of us living inpoverty. We see their faces; we hear their voices;they are a part of us  and we are a part of them.""As the United Nations reaches its sixtiethanniversary  we give thanks for its work inpeacemaking and global reconciliation particularly the historic commitment to eradicatepoverty in the Millennium Declaration of 2000.10Five years have passed  and  despite the triumphof principle  there has been a failure in practice.In this communique  we offer our partnership tothe leaders gathered at the World Summit at theUnited Nations in building a global movement tomake real the promises of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals as a crucial step towards amore just world for all God's children.We believe that God calls us to placepeople struggling with poverty at the centre ofour concern. Globalization has broughtunprecedented economic growth. At the sametime  one sixth of the world's people still fightdaily for survival under the crushing burden ofextreme poverty. The increasing concentration ofwealth in our world  while so many suffer  is ascandal that impoverishes us all.""We believe that the spirit of partnershipbetween rich and poor  exemplified in the MDGs is a way the world can address poverty in all itsdimensions. In particular  we support the goal ofa global partnership for development  and believethat the Churches can make a unique contributionto that partnership.""If nothing else  the fact that the religious leaderswho issued that call gathered from many parts of theworld to agree on a message to our summit Meetingmust remind us that the masses - the people whoelected us - entertain high expectations about theUnited Nations. They see this Organization as theirpre-eminent partner in the continuing struggle to builda better and humane world.They challenge those of us who have theprivilege to represent our States in the United Nationsto build  strengthen and direct this world Organizationso that it can  indeed  play its role as a pre-eminentpartner of the peoples of the world in constructing abetter and more humane world.Accordingly  I believe that we must view with thegreatest seriousness their conclusion that five yearshave passed since we adopted the MillenniumDeclaration and that  'despite this triumph of principle there has been a failure in practice'.Sixty years ago  in the aftermath of thedestructive fury of the Second World War and thevillainous genocide committed during that war  theUnited Nations was formed  in the words of theCharter  ""to save succeeding generations from thescourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has broughtuntold sorrow to mankind"".Responding to the universal demand for humanand peoples' rights  the founders declared that theywere forming the United Nations ""to reaffirm faith inthe fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worthof the human person  in the equal rights of men andwomen and of nations large and small"" and to""promote social progress and better standards of life inlarger freedom"".As we gather here  in part to celebrate the sixtiethanniversary of an international Organizationestablished to bring hope to the peoples of the world we cannot avoid asking some hard questions. That isnecessary if we are to live up to our obligation toensure that the United Nations discharges itsresponsibilities  described by the religious leaders whomet at the Washington National Cathedral aspeacemaking  global reconciliation and the eradicationof poverty.We must ask ourselves how well prepared theUnited Nations is today  60 years after it wasestablished  to save succeeding generations from thescourge of war; to protect and advance the fundamentalhuman rights of all; to protect and advance the dignityand worth of each human person; to ensure equal rightsbetween men and women; to ensure equal rightsbetween nations large and small; and to promote socialprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.We must ask - and answer honestly - whetherwhat we do as the United Nations is properly describedas a triumph of principle but a failure in practice  as thereligious leaders put it.The reality is that  60 years after the UnitedNations was formed as a response to the appalling andghastly results of the crime of racism  we are stillconfronted by the cancer of racism. Although theUnited Nations has adopted important decisions on thatmatter  and convened the necessary conferences tounite the peoples of the world against racism  thosewho continue to fall victim to that crime againsthumanity would find it difficult to cite the instanceswhen the United Nations came to their aid.Sixty years after the United Nations was formed the indecencies of war and violent conflict continue toafflict innocent people  evidently because we  the11United Nations  lack the will to live up to thecommitment that was made when this Organizationwas established.Africans  who have been exposed to many violentconflicts since the United Nations was formed  areparticularly keen for this Organization to live up to itsobligation to save succeeding African generations fromthe scourge of war. Even as we speak  the UnitedNations is faced with the urgent task of taking thenecessary action in CÙte díIvoire to help to bring alasting peace to that important African country opening the way to its reunification  the holding ofdemocratic elections and the promotion of socialprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom to use the words of the Charter.A similar challenge faces this Organization withregard to the restoration of lasting peace in Darfur inthe Sudan  building on the historic conclusion andimplementation of the Sudanese Comprehensive PeaceAgreement  signed in Nairobi  Kenya  earlier this year.Only 11 years ago  we experienced a terriblegenocide in Rwanda  and thousands were killed in theinternecine conflict that took place in the Balkans.Those who were exposed to the savagery would befully justified in concluding that the United Nationshad betrayed its commitment to the peoples of theworld.I am certain that all of us are impatient to see anend to the conflicts in the Middle East  including Iraq and in particular the restoration of the rights of thepeople of Palestine  in the context of the successfulimplementation of the road map.While we welcome recent positive developmentsin this regard  we must accept the reality that every daythat passes without the full implementation of the roadmap only serves to point an accusing finger at us  theUnited Nations  accusing us of not having doneeverything we could to help secure the just and lastingpeace that is the right of the Palestinian  the Israeli andthe Arab peoples.We have all recognized the serious and urgentthreat posed by international terrorism to all ournations. We have all accepted the reality that we need amultilateral response to that common threat. Yet wehave still not succeeded in arriving at a commondefinition of that threat or identified its fundamentalcauses.The issues of non-proliferation and thedisarmament of weapons of mass destruction arematters of critical concern to all nations  both large andsmall. Yet we failed to address those matters in theoutcome document adopted at the review summit lastnight  even as the issue of nuclear weapons and theirnon-proliferation is among the most prominent items inworld news and on the international agenda. None ofus could justly claim that our failure as the UnitedNations to take specific decisions on these mattersserved to enhance global security in the face of thethreat of weapons of mass destruction.With regard to the issue of Iran  we firmly believethat negotiations should resume and that the matter besettled within the framework of the provisions of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsand with the full participation of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency.The gap between the rich and the poor isbecoming worse within and between countries  asobserved by the United Nations DevelopmentProgrammeís 2005 Human Development Report  whichstates that the gap between the average citizen in therichest and in the poorest countries is wide and isgetting wider. It states that in 1990 the averageAmerican was 38 times richer than the averageTanzanian  while today the average American is 61times richer.The same report states  on page 3 ""In 2003  18 countries with a combinedpopulation of 460 million people registered lowerscores on the human development index (HDI)than in 1990 - an unprecedented reversal. In themidst of an increasingly prosperous globaleconomy  10.7 million children every year do notlive to see their fifth birthday  and more than 1billion people survive in abject poverty on lessthan a $1 a day.""Accordingly  if we pause and scan the roadtravelled to judge whether we have succeeded in savingthe world from the scourge of war; whether we havebuilt a world that has reaffirmed faith in fundamentalhuman rights; whether we have created a world thathas restored the dignity and worth of the humanperson - a world that has entrenched equal rights formen and women and for nations  large and small - theanswer from the majority of the people of the worldmay very well be a resounding ""No"".12The United Nations has adopted many decisionsintended to help address the various global challengesthat have persisted over the 60 years of its existence.Accordingly  we have the necessary policies to addressthe social  economic  political and other problemsfacing humanity. We have also adopted comprehensiveand clear programmes to give effect to those policiesand have identified the resources required for theirimplementation.The questions we must answer are: why have wenot implemented these programmes  and what must bedone to correct the situation?The process of globalization means that ourcommon world is more integrated today than it waswhen the United Nations was formed 60 years ago.Similarly  the interconnectedness of the issues ofpeace  security  development and human rights hasnever been more pronounced than it is today. All thismeans that the imperatives that made it necessary andcorrect to establish the United Nations as part of adesirable system of global governance are that muchmore compelling today  and that the necessary reformof the Organization must take place to ensure that itreflects the new global realities since it was formedand that it is empowered to respond effectively to theurgent challenges that face all humanity.And yet  the painful paradox we face is that itseems obvious that  over the years  there has been acontinuous erosion of the authority and prestige of theUnited Nations and a sustained drift towards itsmarginalization in terms of playing its rightful role  asso clearly defined in the United Nations Charter. At itssixtieth session  the General Assembly has the heavyresponsibility to reassert the critical need for theUnited Nations to discharge its responsibilities asspelled out in that Charter. Experience over the last 60years has shown that  to address the criticism levelledagainst the Organization by religious leaders ó thatthere has been a triumph of principle and a failure inpractice ó we must be ready to engage in a sustainedstruggle to ensure that the vision contained in theUnited Nations Charter is actually translated intoreality.As we engage in this struggle  we should say  asdid the religious leaders who met at the WashingtonNational Cathedral  that we are united in a commonconcern for those of us living in poverty: ""We see theirfaces; we hear their voices; they are a part of us  andwe are a part of them.""Let me close by reiterating our deepestsympathies and condolences to the Government and thepeople of the United States in the wake of the deathand destruction wreaked by Hurricane Katrina."
"184",7629,"ZMB",60,2005,"I am pleased to join those who have spoken before me in congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly. For us in Zambia your election is especially significant given the historic bond of friendship   05-51226 9  that exists between our countries. It was in our country that your illustrious compatriot  then Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld  lost his life in 1961 while on a mission for peace in the Congo.   I pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Gabon  who presided over the fifty-ninth session  for his selfless commitment and devotion to the search for consensus on the outcome document which the Assembly adopted two days ago (resolution 60/1). My delegation’s appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General  His Excellency  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his outstanding leadership and dedication to the well-being of the Organization.  Five years ago we committed ourselves to eight identifiable Development Goals. Today we have recommitted ourselves to uphold the principles and meet the Goals set out in the historic Millennium Declaration. We hope that the commitments we have undertaken will not remain mere empty words but that  this time around  the international community will make a concerted effort to implement them. In this regard we are inspired by the report of the High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change (A/59/565). Those of us from Africa see the report of the Secretary-General (A/59/2005) as an opportunity to realize the goals set out in the Organization of African Unity’s 1997 Harare Declaration  which called for the reform of the United Nations Security Council.  My delegation supports the demand of the African Union for two permanent seats on the Security Council  with all the privileges attached to such seats  including the right of veto. Our position is not meant to frustrate the reform process. The African region considers the reform of the Organization as an opportunity to correct historical injustices that stand as a dark cloud over our people. We would actually prefer that the right of veto be removed from the United Nations  as it is undemocratic. We are  however  aware that some permanent members of the Security Council are reluctant to give up the veto power at the moment. It is in this regard that Africa  like other regions  deserves the right of veto  as the absence of that right will only serve to perpetuate the marginalization of the continent.  The position I have outlined does not in any way mean that Africa is against the expansion of the Security Council to include other important countries that contribute to international peace and security. Let me reaffirm in this regard that Zambia supports the four candidate States of Brazil  Germany  India and Japan for permanent membership of the Security Council with full privileges  including that of veto power. I am only stressing that Africa is entitled to  and deserves the right of  permanent representation in the Security Council  with the right of veto  not only as a matter of correcting an historical injustice against Africa but also to uphold the democratic principles of regional equality.  Two days ago we adopted the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the review of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The High-level Plenary Meeting provided a rare opportunity for us to share experiences in the implementation of the development agenda  in particular  and highlighted the need for enhanced international cooperation and coordination if we are to achieve much-sought-after economic development. While the document does not contain everything we would have wanted to include  it nevertheless represents an important basis for continued dialogue during this session.  Since 2001 Africa has been implementing the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  whose main objective is to enhance the capacity of African countries to reduce the high incidence of poverty on the continent and to strengthen efforts to achieve sustainable economic development. While we acknowledge the support that the international community has so far rendered to the realization of NEPAD’s objectives  it is also true that this support that has proved to be insufficient.  It is the view of my Government that while official development assistance (ODA) may help in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  trade would help to sustain those gains. In this regard  Zambia urges all stakeholders to bring to a speedy conclusion the Doha round of trade negotiations  which will act as a catalyst towards achieving sustainable development. The external debt problem is still a major hindrance to development. The current unfavourable terms in agriculture and commodity trading make the problem even more unbearable.  My delegation commends the United Nations for supporting the efforts of the African Union’s peace initiatives on the continent. The Pan-African    10 05-51226  Parliament and the Peace and Security Council are part of the infrastructure in support of peace and security. In this regard  I wish to pledge Zambia’s continued support of the process.  Zambia  as one of the core States of the Great Lakes region  would like to associate itself with the remarkable progress that continues to be made in the areas of peace and security in the subregion since the 17 November 2003 report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on preparations for an international conference on the Great Lakes region (S/2003/1099). We are encouraged by some positive developments brought about so far through the process of regional ownership and international partnership and the combined efforts of the United Nations  the African Union  the Group of Friends and the subregional Governments concerned.  My Government will continue to play its part in the fight against international terrorism. Zambia rejects terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We are determined to work with the rest of the international community to implement the counter-terrorism strategy.   Zambia is committed to promoting and respecting human rights  the rule of law and democracy. In Zambia we believe that democracy is a universal value. We believe therefore it is under conditions of democracy that all human rights are protected.  Allow me to conclude my statement by referring to the efforts my Government is making to fight corruption. The nation as a whole has realized that the state of our economy could have been much better if all the resources available had been utilized properly. In this regard  one cannot overemphasize the fact that corruption erodes the incomes of households and businesses  thus defeating efforts to reduce poverty. I wish to explain that the Zambia Task Force on Corruption is an instrument for development that my Government hopes will enhance the capacity to utilize public resources for purposes that benefit the nation as a whole. More important  the attainment of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative completion point by my country can  in large measure  be attributed to the success of the campaign against corruption  which prompted the Government to introduce stringent financial controls and transparent and accountable public expenditure measures. The United Nations should consider increasing its resources in the fight against corruption.  As we mark the sixtieth anniversary of this  our great institution  we cannot but conclude that its importance and continued relevance to mankind is beyond question. It is in that context that we need to revitalize it in order for it to fulfil the ideals for which it was established. "
"185",7665,"ZWE",60,2005,"Allow me to extend to you  Sir  our sincere congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly and to express our confidence in your ability   05-51226 5  to guide our work throughout the session. In the same breath  let me also express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jean Ping  for managing successfully the very difficult business of the fifty-ninth session.  Although we began our last session with a weighty agenda  we were able to reach general agreement on a number of important issues in the area of development. We are yet to agree on other pressing issues  such as the reform of the Security Council and the composition of a new Human Rights Council.  For many years we have spoken in favour of an approach to international peace and security that is firmly rooted in the principle of multilateralism and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. We maintain that any diversion from this approach is unacceptable  undesirable and devoid of legal justification. We are pleased to note that the majority of views expressed during the last session reinforced that principle.   Our expectation is that the Security Council in its current form  or in whatever character and composition it will eventually take  will  like all other bodies of the United Nations  limit itself to what is contained in its mandate. We do not subscribe to the suggestion that all problems — social  cultural  economic and health  among others — are necessarily threats to international peace and security and should therefore be referred to the Security Council.   Recently we witnessed the United Kingdom abusing its privilege and acting dishonestly as a member of the Council by seeking to score cheap political points in its bilateral dispute with us. We were dragged on to the Council’s agenda over an issue that has no relevance to the maintenance of international peace and security. Let me pay tribute to those members of the Security Council who saw through this cheap politicking and manipulation of procedures — which the same country  by the way  has vowed to resume as soon as the Council is appropriately chaired. It is my hope that other Member countries will join us in rejecting this neocolonialist attempt and blatant interference in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe. But then  is it not obvious  that Britain under the regime of Tony Blair has ceased to respect the Charter of the United Nations? Witness its being a principal member of the illegal anti-Iraq coalition that went on a devastating campaign in that country in complete defiance of the United Nations Charter. Any State or group of States that commits such an act of aggression on another  justifying it on blatant falsehoods  surely becomes guilty of State terrorism.   Zimbabwe is a country at peace with itself and with its neighbours and offers absolutely no threat to international peace and security. Is it not therefore surprising that Britain and its Anglo-Saxon allies have embarked on a vicious campaign of first peddling blatant lies intended to tarnish it and then appealing to Europe and America for sanctions against it?   Those imperialist countries have unashamedly abused the power of the media by hypocritically portraying themselves as philanthropists and international saviours of victims of various calamities. Yet they have remained silent about the shocking circumstances of obvious State neglect surrounding the tragic Gulf coast disaster  where a whole community of mainly non-whites was deliberately abandoned to the ravages of Hurricane Katrina as sacrificial lambs  and sacrificed to which god one cannot tell. Most of the victims were blacks. And we are bound to ask what transgressions we  the blacks of this world  have committed? Was it not enough punishment and suffering in history that we were uprooted and made helpless slaves  not only in new colonial outposts but also domestically at home  through a vicious system of colonialism that made us landless  propertyless and mere slaves and serfs in our own lands?   Must we again in this day of humanitarian ethics  this day of the sacred principles of the equality of mankind and the rights of men and women  this day that has seen us assemble here to save  enhance and prolong life  become victims of callous racial neglect? We of Africa protest that in this day and age we should continue to be treated as lesser human beings than other races.   We reiterate our deep sympathies and condolences over the massive loss of life that occurred in the Hurricane Katrina disaster. If  as we are told  many who survived the wrath of Hurricane Katrina are still dispersed  the question we ask ourselves is where they are and for how long will they remain where they are. We ask further whether they will ever get back  truly rehabilitated  to their original homes — properly rehabilitated also  homes which at present are mere wreckages. Where  I ask  are the Zimbabwe-famous United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) and the Commission on Human Rights?    6 05-51226  Why should they maintain an ominous silence? For here is real homeless work for HABITAT and the Commission on Human Rights. This indeed is where they rightly belong and not anywhere in Zimbabwe. We do not need them there.  With reference to the vexatious issue of the reform of the Security Council  we have made our views known through the African Union. We seek fair and equal treatment as partners in this community of nations and pledge our commitment to work with others in pursuit of that objective.  The promotion of human rights is one of the major aims of the United Nations as enshrined in its Charter. As such  the subject rightly occupies space on the agenda of each session of the General Assembly  including this one. We believe that the United Nations should make every effort to promote and protect the full enjoyment of human rights  including the right to development. Regrettably  we have seen over the years a deliberate tendency to create a distorted hierarchy of rights  with the sole mischievous purpose of overplaying civil and political rights while downplaying economic  social and cultural rights. That explains why the whole human rights agenda  instead of being a cooperative exercise  has degenerated into a Western-managed kangaroo court  always looking out for “criminals”  as they call them  among developing countries. Hence  we continue to argue that the human rights discourse needs to be rid of selectivity and double standards and to be approached without hidden political agendas.  The African Union has indicated its support for the establishment of a Human Rights Council that will be subordinated to the General Assembly. Zimbabwe subscribes fully to that position. We believe  however  that a correctly sized and properly structured Council  with equitable geographical representation  will be a major step in addressing the deficiencies of the current Commission on Human Rights.  At the beginning of the last session (see A/59/PV.5) I informed the Assembly that despite the recurrent droughts that we had experienced  Zimbabwe had the capacity to cope with its situation of hunger and was thus not appealing for humanitarian intervention. In spite of that message  our detractors and ill-wishers have been projecting a false picture of mass starvation. There has been none of that. Recently  particularly in the aftermath of our urban clean-up operation  popularly known at home as Operation Murambatsvina  or Operation Restore Order  the familiar noises re-echoed from the same malicious prophets of doom claiming that there was a humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe. Those unfounded alarms are aimed at deliberately tarnishing the image of Zimbabwe and projecting it as a failed State. We find it strange and obviously anomalous that the Government of Zimbabwe should be maligned and condemned for restoring order and the rule of law in its municipal areas. Our detractors fail to acknowledge that Operation Restore Order soon gave way to a well-planned  vast reconstruction programme through which properly planned accommodation  factory shells and vending stalls are being constructed in many areas of the country for our people. We have rejected the scandalous demand  as expressed in Special Envoy Anna Tibaijuka’s report  that we lower our urban housing standards to allow for mud huts  bush latrines and pit toilets as suitable for our urban people and for Africans generally. Nothing can be more insulting and degrading of a people than that. Surely we do not need development in reverse.  Let me conclude by making my message to our detractors very simple and clear. The people of Zimbabwe came through a protracted guerrilla struggle to establish themselves as a free — I emphasize “free” — and sovereign nation. We indeed went through long and bitter times to get our freedom and independence  and to be where we are today. We cherish that hard-won freedom and independence  and no amount of coercion  political  economic or otherwise  will make us a colony again. But we also cherish peace and development and good regional and international relations. Together with all other nations of good will  we will continue to work tirelessly for a just  peaceful and prosperous world. "
