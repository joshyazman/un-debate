"1",28,"AFG",53,1998,"The urgency of thealarming situation in Afghanistan  particularly given theevents of the past few months  requires me to explain whyand how that situation continues to pose major threats tothe peace and security of the world.There is an evil triangle that is haunting our region.This evil triangle has imprisoned and terrorized an entirenation. It has almost engulfed our region in a majorconfrontation. The spread of this evil triangle like a plagueis about to contaminate the entire area  setting off alarmbells from the Far East to the Far West  even echoing infaraway capitals of the world. The evil triangle I amreferring to is one between: first  the Pakistani militaryInter-Service Intelligence (ISI); secondly  branches ofinternational terrorism and drug traffickers operating fromAfghanistan; and thirdly  the infamous Taliban militia.On 7 August 1998  two African capitals sufferedmajor explosions  sending a shock wave of internationalterrorism throughout the world. The following day  nineIranian diplomats and a journalist were ferociouslygunned down inside the Consulate-General of the IslamicRepublic of Iran in Mazar-i-Sharif. According to AmnestyInternational  from 8 to 10 August thousands of ethnicHazara civilians were killed in Mazar-i-Sharif. On 21August 1998  Lieutenant-Colonel Carmine Calo  MilitaryAdviser to the United Nations Special Mission toAfghanistan  an Italian national  was brutally murdered bytwo Pakistani terrorists on assignment in Kabul. All ofthese shocking events have one thing in common: theimplementation of an anachronistic socio-political agendaby means of destructive force and violence and theadventurous hegemony of the Pakistani army in theregion. These things pose a direct threat to regional peaceand security.Three major concerns — namely  terrorism  drugsand the violation of human rights — are originating in theTaliban-held areas of Afghanistan  but they are beinginstigated from across the border. During the twelfthsummit of the Non-Aligned Movement  on 3 September1998 in Durban  South Africa  President BurhanuddinRabbani brought these issues to the attention of thesummit. In its paragraphs on terrorism the FinalDocument of the summit says it is imperative that noState organize  assist or participate in terrorist acts in theterritories of other States or encourage activities directedtowards such acts  including permitting the use of nationalterritory or the soil of a neighbouring country forplanning and training for such a purpose and or thefinancing of terrorist activities. Paragraph 153 of the FinalDocument states that the heads of State or Governmentsolemnly reaffirmed their unequivocal condemnation ofany political  diplomatic  moral or material support forterrorism. We fully agree with the generally expressedview that the global phenomenon of terrorism requires acollective and concerted response.Afghanistan  along with other members of the Non-Aligned Movement  also condemns the practice ofrecruiting  financing  training  using or supportingmercenaries as a violation of the purposes and principlesof the Charter of the United Nations. Let us make it clearonce again here that the Taliban are Pakistanimercenaries.26On 28 August 1998  pursuant to the deterioration ofthe situation stemming from a whole new series of militaryactivities evidently directed by the cross-border ISI officers the Security Council adopted an important resolution  1193(1998)  for which President Rabbani voiced his firm supportat the Durban summit. However  the response of theTaliban mercenaries and their cross-border patrons to theresolution — a major assault on Bamyan valley on 14September  during which the most atrocious acts werecommitted against the civilian population of the valley —was yet another vow to continue their military agenda.Presently  the only country that takes pride inrecognizing the Taliban and in fact urges others to do thesame remains Pakistan. The Pakistani meddling inAfghanistan — which has direct consequences for Pakistanitself and the entire region — has best been summarized inthe Pakistani daily The News on 25 September 1998. Iquote:“North-West Asia is in great trouble and the Talibanare the catalyst behind it. The Taliban have not justdragged Iran and the Central Asian republics into theconflict  they have also pushed Pakistan into a tenserelationship with all its Muslim neighbours. What wassupposed to provide Pakistan with strategic depth'has turned into a quagmire. Islamabad is now facedwith yet another critical choice between either cuttingTaliban to size or siding with them against friendlyneighbours.”The article continues  and I quote “If somebody thinks that with the Taliban victorya lasting peace will be restored in Afghanistan andpeace dividends will start flowing in  he is sadlymistaken.”Headlines such as “Crises push Pakistan to the brinkof disaster” in the Washington Post of 26 September areearly warnings about a state of affairs that will affect theentire region. In fact  when a fragile and vulnerable countrylike Pakistan involves itself in a great game  as the Afghanipeople say  it digs its own grave.Article 1 of the United Nations Charter calls foreffective and collective measures for the prevention andremoval of threats to peace. Consistent with this  theIslamic State of Afghanistan  over the past three years  hasrepeatedly warned the international community of themounting threat to regional peace and security posed by thePakistani Government?s military intelligence service  (ISI) and its mercenaries  the Taliban  in Afghanistan.Unfortunately  these early warnings have all goneunheard.Today  the exacerbated situation in Afghanistan andits menacing implications for the region and beyond areexactly what we deserve. The international communitymust admit that it has done too little in the face of theincreasingly bold and aggressive ISI policy towardsAfghanistan and has gone too far with its policy ofappeasement towards the Taliban in their fight against therest of the world. The Security Council must determinethe existence of this threat to peace  breach of the peaceand act of aggression by Pakistan  and should takeappropriate measures against the perpetrators inconformity with Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter. Thealarming situation in Afghanistan requires definitiveaction by the Security Council. It is time that the presenceof about 28 000 armed Pakistanis in Afghanistan wasdealt with in accordance with Article 39 of the UnitedNations Charter.The Taliban?s obstinately rejectionist andintransigent attitude towards peace and human rights iswell known to the international community. Let us recallonce again how the Taliban?s retrograde militia  helpedand patronized by their cross-border allies  visualize andconceive the events in Afghanistan.The Taliban have their own answer to every issueraised by the United Nations and the internationalcommunity. When asked to establish a broad-basedrepresentative Government  the Taliban reply that theyhave brought many parts of Afghanistan under theirmilitary domination and that this is a broad-basedrepresentative Government. When requested to holdelections in Afghanistan  the Taliban state that electionsare unIslamic. They say that other Muslim countrieswhich adhere to the principle of elections haveoverlooked the true teachings of Islam. When told torespect human rights  the Taliban reply that they havetheir own standards for human rights. They say thathuman rights in other Muslim countries are not based onIslam.In response to constant appeals to respect the humanrights of women and reopen girls? schools  the Taliban quoted in The Washington Post of 25 September 1998 say that27“the countries that shout about freedom for womenwant to use them only for prostitution andentertainment until they get old and useless”.The Taliban say they know best what to do with womenand girls.When asked to put an end to drug production andtrafficking  the Taliban say that  though produced inAfghanistan  narcotics are consumed overseas. They alsosay that drug production and smuggling  operations whichthe Taliban and some Pakistani military officers jointlymaintain  earn them profits. When asked to holdnegotiations with the parties to the conflict  the Taliban again quoted in The Washington Post  say that their firstpriority has been to disarm the opposition and thatnegotiations will follow only then.Peace has no place on the Taliban agenda. Even whenMr. Lakhdar Brahimi  the Secretary-General?s SpecialEnvoy  urged them to attend the face-to-face talks with us held in Ashgabat on 5 April 1998  they did not participate.On 25 April 1998  the negotiations between both sides inIslamabad — under the supervision of the United Nationsand the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) —were unilaterally abandoned by the Taliban and theceasefire observed at the request of the United Nations andthe United States was pre-emptively broken by a majorTaliban offensive north of Kabul. Because of the failure ofthe Taliban?s military offensive  they returned the followingday  26 April  for further negotiations  but soon unilaterallyand definitively abandoned the negotiations once more  asnoted by the Secretary-General.In essence  the Taliban?s intransigence stems fromtheir firm and stubborn conviction that the only solution isa military solution. This conviction is also indicative of theideas of their Pakistani mentors  who are determined todominate Afghanistan. Thus  any and all efforts to reach apeaceful solution have been intentionally thwarted. It cameas a surprise to no one that the Taliban not only refused toattend the intra-Afghan gathering on 18 July 1998 in Bonn Germany  which sought to initiate what was hoped wouldbe the traditional grand assembly  or Loya jirgah  but also one week earlier  condemned the all-Afghan gathering andlaunched major military operations  supported by thePakistani air force  in northern Afghanistan.The Islamic State of Afghanistan strongly confirms theviews that have been expressed in this Assembly for yearsthat there is no military solution to the conflict inAfghanistan. The withdrawal of foreign military andarmed personnel and the return of the opposition to thenegotiating table for a political dialogue aimed atachieving a lasting political settlement of the conflict along with the formation of a fully representative  broad-based  multi-ethnic Government  are the main points thatcould ensure an environment of peace in Afghanistan andthe entire region.We are proposing such an intra-Afghan dialoguewithout delay or precondition  on the basis of thefollowing principles  which emanate from our nationalplatform and international commitment to Article 2 paragraph 2 of the United Nations Charter  as well to asour tenets and culture.First  concerning the principles of Islam  the Islamictenets and teachings are guidelines of supreme value  incompliance with which the future political system  theconstitution and other laws shall be founded.Secondly  the principle of democracy and pluralismshall constitute the mainspring of the future politicalsystem to be formed in Afghanistan.Thirdly  concerning the principle of human rights the observation of and respect for human rights —including the rights of women and girls to education work and beneficial coexistence in harmony with theprovisions of human rights instruments — are among theprinciples that shall be integral parts of any peaceagreement. This shows our commitment as a member ofthe international community.Fourthly  the principle of elections and thedelegation of authority to local government shall beincorporated into any peace agreement as urgent andnecessary elements of confidence-building and as therealization of the will of the people. Local administrationsand their leaders  including the members of provincialcouncils  shall all be elected. The central representativeGovernment  to be equitably accommodating to all ethnicgroups and segments of Afghan society  shall functionconstitutionally.Fifthly  as to the principles of permanent neutralityand independence  countries of the region and theinternational community shall recognize the permanentneutrality of Afghanistan. Afghanistan will never enterinto any political or military alliance against any Stateand Afghan soil will not be used as a base for hostilitiesagainst another State. International relations shall be28conducted independently  in a manner consistent with theprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.Afghanistan shall actively participate in the processes ofregional economic cooperation  transit and transport oftrade. It shall be a good partner in the community ofnations.The Islamic State of Afghanistan welcomes themeeting of the “Six plus Two” group  held at the level ofForeign Ministers in New York on 21 September 1998.Afghanistan fully agrees with the points of commonunderstanding and expresses its firm support for theSecretary-General?s decision to send his Special Envoy Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi  to the region. Afghanistanremains committed to giving his mission its fullcooperation.The Islamic State of Afghanistan firmly supports theinstitutional reform of the United Nations  rightly referredto as a “quiet revolution” by the Secretary-General.Similarly  the establishment of a Development Account andthe United Nations Fund for International Partnerships among other innovations  deserve the support of MemberStates. However  the least developed countries and inparticular those stricken by war  have to be given priorityattention in this field.In their Declaration on the Occasion of the FiftiethAnniversary of the United Nations  Member Statespromised to“give to the twenty-first century a United Nationsequipped  financed and structured to serve effectivelythe peoples in whose name it was established”.(resolution 50/6)This has to include the institutional framework of theOrganization  namely  a Security Council with workingmethods and a composition that better reflect today?s needsand realities.The Working Group that has been mandated toexamine this question will soon start its sixth year ofintensive discussions. These discussions cannot go onindefinitely. It is time to set a concrete agenda and to act ifwe want to meet the challenges of the next millennium.Afghanistan therefore supports an overall reform whichwould make the Security Council?s work more transparentand its composition more representative. This would meanpermanent seats for the developing and the developedworld  the latter to include global economic players such asGermany and Japan. At the same time  a sufficient numberof non-permanent seats should be added to take intoaccount the interests of smaller and medium-sizedcountries. The Charter therefore must be amended inorder drastically to reduce the use of the right of veto which is most undemocratic. The coming century requiresa Security Council that conforms with the new landscapeof the world."
"2",67,"AGO",53,1998,"Allow me tobegin by congratulating Mr. Didier Opertti  on behalf ofthe Government of the Republic of Angola  on hiselection to the presidency of the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly. We are convinced that his experience wisdom and diplomatic skills will help us to achieve thegoals we set for this new session.Angola is especially pleased by the election of arepresentative from Uruguay  a country that has greatlycontributed to the preservation of peace and security inthe world  as was recently demonstrated by itsparticipation in the United Nations peacekeeping operationin Angola.I should like to pay tribute to the outgoing Presidentfor the manner in which he conducted the work of thisimportant body during his mandate. And a word ofappreciation goes also to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his dynamism and for the wisdom he hasdemonstrated at the helm of our Organization.Almost 10 years have passed since the end of theEast-West confrontation. We had hoped that by this timethere would have been a greater positive impact on theinternational scene  especially regarding peace andsecurity  and economic development.Unfortunately  in spite of the progress we havemade — particularly in the promotion of democraticvalues and in the greater respect for human rights  amongothers — we are still witnessing the proliferation ofinternal armed conflicts  violent border disputes amongnations  military aggression against independent andsovereign States  continued degradation of theenvironment  and economic decline with the consequentsocial and economic deterioration  especially indeveloping countries. We are also witnessing an increase10in transnational organized crime and terrorism  which posesa serious threat to the stability of all nations.This scenario casts a shadow over the prospects forthe rapid implementation of the new political world orderthat emerged as a result of the end of the cold war  whichwould bring peace  stability  development and democracy.We still have a long way to go.It is incumbent on the United Nations  given itsuniversal character and singular role in internationalrelations  to shoulder the main responsibility in the searchfor solutions to all the problems that have become obstaclesto achieving peaceful development and the well-being ofour peoples  and in devising fair and effective formulas thatmeet the collective interests of its Members.The question of conflict resolution and preventionshould be given high priority  for this will ensure thealleviation of tension in the world. The urgent creation ofearly-warning mechanisms will certainly enable theinternational community to act in a timely manner toprevent the triggering of potential conflicts  thus avoidingthe repetition of past mistakes  such as those we have seenrecently in Africa.In this connection  Angola shares the views of theSecretary-General as expressed in the recommendations inhis report (A/52/871) on the prevention of conflict and thepromotion of sustainable development in Africa  and hopesthat the members of the Security Council will turn theminto practical action.United Nations international arms control effortsshould not be restricted to weapons of mass destruction. Wemust urgently focus on the issue of small arms and otherwar matériel sold to terrorist groups by some producercountries. These supplies have led to an increase in armedactions by subversive groups and are an incentive to allthose who wish to take power by force. We believe that thecreation of special mechanisms for the control of small-arms exports to armed groups  as well as the imposition ofrestrictive measures against those States that violate them could help to stop the proliferation of weapons around theworld.The United Nations  in cooperation with regional andsubregional organizations  should promote the creation ofcollective defence and security mechanisms as a means toprevent the threat of conflict and guarantee the territorialintegrity  independence and sovereignty of States.The United Nations will not be able to face many ofits challenges unless it can count on the commitment andengagement of its Member States. This is especially truewith respect to the resolution of its financial crisis and thereform of its structures to conform to the newinternational reality. We feel encouraged by the reformsundertaken by the Secretary-General aimed at turning theOrganization into a more dynamic and effective body.The reform process must be thorough and include theUnited Nations main bodies  especially the SecurityCouncil. The Council’s current structure is outdated.Angola supports eliminating the current geographicalimbalance in the composition of the Security Council byincreasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent members to ensure that the main regions of theworld are fairly represented.The claim of the African continent to at least twopermanent seats should be adequately addressed  not onlybecause the region is not currently represented at all  butalso because it is the largest regional group in the UnitedNations. Angola also supports the Brazilian claim to apermanent seat given the exceptional role the country hasplayed in United Nations activities in all areas  andespecially because it belongs to a region that has nopermanent members in the Security Council.The Republic of Angola is facing a difficult andcritical phase in its history. We cannot yet announce theend of the war and the beginning of a new era ofconsolidation of democracy in Angola. The peace processand all related efforts made by both the AngolanGovernment and the international community are blockeddue to UNITA’s deliberate  systematic non-compliancewith the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol  the pertinentSecurity Council resolutions and Angolan law. Mr. JonasSavimbi has demonstrated his unwillingness to transformUNITA into a civilian political party.As Members are aware  the Lusaka Protocol  signedby the Government and UNITA in 1994  should have ledto the end of the internal conflict  which was resumed byUNITA after its defeat in the 1992 general elections. But four years since the agreement came into force the peaceprocess has yet to be concluded  and  what is even moredangerous  it has suffered serious setbacks due to thesuccessive obstacles raised by UNITA’s militarist wing led by Mr. Savimbi. UNITA deliberately deceived theUnited Nations and the international community when itdeclared that it was totally demilitarized. As the SecurityCouncil itself could determine  UNITA continues to11maintain active military units with sophisticated weaponry.UNITA has also hindered the process of normalizationof State administration by refusing to abandon the areas itillegally occupies. At the same time  it has initiated a newescalation of hostilities throughout the country  unleashingarmed attacks against local government authorities  thenational police and the national armed forces  while alsoengaging in massacres of the civilian population. Hundredsof people have been killed  mostly civilians; about a millionhave been displaced; and UNITA has reoccupied areaswhere State administration had already been normalized.The United Nations Blue Helmet units and humanitarianconvoys have also been targets of UNITA’s militaryactions  which constitute crimes against humanity  giventheir nature and characteristics as well as the coldness andcruelty with which they are committed. They are terroristcrimes as defined by international human rights andhumanitarian law instruments. The international communitycannot passively watch these systematic abuses  which floutinternational legal and moral values.During the recent summit in Durban  South Africa  theheads of State or Government of the Non-AlignedMovement condemned Jonas Savimbi for these systematichuman rights abuses. Similarly  the heads of State orGovernment of the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) — well aware of the seriousness ofthe Angolan situation  which has had terrible repercussionsfor the whole region — held Mr. Savimbi solelyresponsible for the current stalemate in the application ofthe Lusaka Protocol. Due to Mr. Savimbi’s staunch pursuitof war as the only means to attain political power  he iscontinuing to reinforce his military wing’s capabilities. Thisbehaviour was declared by SADC to be that of a warcriminal. As has been done in some other regions of theworld  Mr. Savimbi and perhaps his closest collaborators —who together are responsible for all the war crimescommitted in Angola — should be made to respond incourt for the heinous crimes they have committed overmany years.Throughout the peace process  Jonas Savimbi’s stancehas revealed a personal strategy aimed at creatinggeneralized chaos in the country in order to take power byforce. The facts are clear: it does not make sense forUNITA to resort to armed struggle against a State wherepolitical activity is not restricted and where UNITAparticipates in its main political institutions — namely  theGovernment and Parliament. Furthermore  Angola’s armedforces include hundreds of UNITA members  includinggenerals.It is unacceptable to have a political organizationsuch as UNITA  which is not even subject to internationallaw  challenging each and everyone  including theSecurity Council by blatantly and systematically violatingits resolutions. UNITA itself is being penalized becauseof one man  Mr. Savimbi  who abuses the good faith ofhis countrymen who believed in UNITA as a crediblepolitical alternative in the emerging political system of thefledgling Angolan democracy.For all those reasons  the Security Council inresolution 1127 (1997) tried to separate the wheat fromthe chaff. In the course of imposing new sanctions againstUNITA  the Council issued a list of UNITA membersuniversally considered dangerous elements. This list isheaded by Mr. Savimbi  who is thereby forbidden tofreely circulate in the world. Only a criminal wouldreceive such a sanction from the international community.Along those lines  the Angolan Government hassuspended UNITA members from participation in theGovernment. The Government demanded a clarificationof their position vis-à-vis the peace process in Angola:either they are in favour of peace and democracy  or  liketheir leader  they choose war as a means to take politicalpower. All those who chose peace have since resumed theactivities for which they had been appointed within theframework of the Government of Unity and NationalReconciliation. Recently  political leaders and partycadres  together with officers from UNITA  made it clearthat they did not support war as does Mr. Jonas Savimbi.On 2 August  they issued a political manifestodenouncing Mr. Savimbi’s behaviour and  in an effort torevitalize UNITA  they created a Renovation Committeewhich removed Mr. Savimbi from the leadership of theparty. The goals defended by the UNITA RenovationCommittee in its political manifesto are those of peaceand the consolidation of democracy. This renovationmovement supports the peace accords  nationalreconciliation and the effective transformation of UNITAinto a civilian political party  and it has given a newbreath of hope for the conclusion of the peace process.For that reason  the Angolan Government hasdecided to recognize UNITA’s Renovation Committee asits only interlocutor and partner in the implementation ofoutstanding tasks in the Lusaka Protocol. The SADCcountries have already recognized the RenovationCommittee  and we are convinced that the internationalcommunity at large will not hesitate to support andpromote the efforts of the new UNITA leadership as it12assumes its role in the young  multi-party democracy inAngola.The Government of Angola does not believe it iseither prudent or realistic  but rather  dangerous  to yetagain give Mr. Savimbi the benefit of the doubt. Thiswould only lead to more false expectations  and we wouldbe wasting much valuable time to take appropriatemeasures in this respect.In the light of the new situation in UNITA  theAngolan Government feels optimistic and therefore is stillcommitted to the successful conclusion of the LusakaProtocol. It will  however  continue to take all necessarymeasures against those who pursue attempts to disrupt thepolitical order  so as to guarantee the territorial integrity ofthe country and the protection of its citizens.From this rostrum we want to draw the attention ofcountries  such as the Togolese Republic and Burkina Fasoto the fact that the Government of Angola will not continueto tolerate the support they are providing to UNITA’smilitarist wing led by Mr. Savimbi. This includes facilitiesfor military training for these groups to commit terroristacts in Angola. This is a clear violation of the Organizationof African Unity (OAU) Charter  the United Nations charterand Security Council resolutions 864 (1993)  1127 (1997)and 1173 (1998).I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate myGovernment’s heartfelt tribute to the efforts and role of theUnited Nations in the peace process in Angola  andespecially the contribution of the late Matre Blondin Beye former Special Representative of the Secretary-General  insupport of peace in Angola.I would also like to reiterate my Government’s appealto the international community to continue to renderhumanitarian assistance to the displaced people in Angolaand to assist in the rehabilitation of social and economicinfrastructures.Angola is also concerned about events in other areasaround the world. In the Democratic Republic of theCongo  the military invasion by foreign forces is a seriousthreat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of thatcountry. This could also destabilize the central and southernregions of the continent. This led some countries  includingAngola  to consent to the request for military aid by theCongolese authorities within the framework of the SADCOrgan on Politics  Defence and Security.The recent summit in Victoria Falls of the leaders ofthe countries involved in the problem is a step in the rightdirection for the resolution of the crisis. Angola supportsthe withdrawal of the invading troops and the drafting ofan agreement that ensures respect by all countries in theregion of the independence  territorial integrity andsovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.This would enable that country’s authorities to begin thetask of establishing a broad internal dialogue that shouldlead to general elections in 1999  in accordance with thedemocratization programme established by PresidentKabila.Angola welcomes the reinstatement of thelegitimately elected authorities in Sierra Leone and theinitiation of the process of the return of the refugees.Angola hopes this is the beginning of the normalizationof the situation in that country.In Guinea-Bissau  the signing of a ceasefireagreement between the Government and the junta opensbroad opportunities for a negotiated end to the conflict.We salute and encourage the efforts being developed bythe Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries(CPLP)  where Angola  along with the countries of theregion  will continue to contribute to their efforts to fosterreconciliation between brothers and sisters in Guinea-Bissau.In Western Sahara  the obstacles placed in the pathof a peaceful solution have been progressively removed.Angola continues to believe that a referendum held on thebasis of fairness and justice is the best means for thepeople in the territory to choose their own destiny. Wesupport the continuation of United Nations and OAU jointefforts.We would also like to call the attention of theinternational community to the problem of Somalia.Although we recognize that the parties to the conflicthave the primary responsibility for finding a peacefulsolution  we believe this will be possible only with thesupport of the United Nations.We regret the lack of significant progress in theMiddle East peace process. Angola encourages the partiesto comply with the commitments made under the Osloagreement. We continue to defend the right of thePalestinian people to self-determination  and we advocatea rapid and fair resolution of the issues of the occupiedArab territories  including Palestine  which should takeinto account the interests of all the peoples in the region.13We believe that this will ease the tensions in Arab-Israelirelations.The situation in East Timor  a territory with whichAngola shares linguistic links and a common anti-colonialstruggle  has recently seen positive developments as a resultof the understanding reached between Indonesia andPortugal  under the auspices of the United Nations on thereduction of the Indonesian military presence in theterritory  will contribute to the achievement of a peacefulsolution. Angola reaffirms its support for the struggle of thepeople of East Timor for their right to self-determination.The current world economic situation raises seriousconcerns  since it contributes directly to the deterioration ofthe standards of living of millions of human beings especially those in developing countries. We are concernedby the imposition of unilateral restrictions to free trade andfinancial and economic cooperation  such as the embargoimposed against Cuba. Its victims are the most vulnerablegroups in society: women and children. The extraterritorialnature of these measures runs counter to international lawand does not contribute to forging links of friendshipamong peoples.We believe that we urgently need to promoteinternational economic cooperation based on a partnershipthat will allow all those that participate in the process toshare equitably in its gains. In spite of the implementationof endless reforms and structural adjustment programmes as recommended by the International Monetary Fund andthe World Bank  the economies of developing countriescontinue to make such modest advances that we mustquestion the real objectives of such reforms.We join with those who have spoken before us inreiterating our need to consider establishing a newinternational economic order that is more real  more fairand more equitable  capable of strengthening theinternational financial system and supporting nationalefforts to promote economic development throughout theworld.It is not enough to appeal to the understanding of thedeveloped countries. We need to be more strongly involvedin the transformation of the international economic picture.The application of measures that would have an immediateimpact  accompanied by well-structured programmes  suchas the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative forAfrica  deserve special attention if they are to attain thesuccess we expect of them.The Final Declaration of the twelfth summit of non-aligned countries  recently held in Durban  South Africa also defines some steps that can be taken to solve thecrisis  among which it underscores an increase in South-South cooperation.This year  we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.This occasion should be an incentive to develop effectiveinstruments to promote and protect all human rights andfundamental freedoms  since non-respect of these rightsis the main cause of conflict and instability. Theestablishment of the International Criminal Court will bea significant step in this direction. The AngolanGovernment is sparing no effort to promote  protect anddefend all human rights. Were it not for the bellicosebehaviour of Mr. Savimbi  Angola would have hosted late this year  the first ministerial conference of theOrganization of African Unity on human and peoples’rights in Africa. That initiative was my Government’scontribution to the jubilee of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights.In conclusion  let me emphasize the role the UnitedNations is playing to promote and protect human rightsthroughout the world."
"3",114,"ALB",53,1998,"Allow me first  Sir  tocongratulate you on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. I am sure that5your leadership constitutes a guarantee of continuedsuccess.At the same time  I would like to express myappreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Udovenko  for hisexcellent leadership during the fifty-second session.It is a special pleasure for me to address the Assemblyin this session  which coincides with the fiftieth anniversaryof the Universal Declaration of the Human Rights.Although decades have passed  this document remainsprofoundly relevant to our world today. In fact  itsstandards continue to be an essential guide for evaluatingthe development and emancipation of human society. TheMember countries of the United Nations should be proud ofthis document’s lasting legacy.While affirming the ongoing importance of theDeclaration  I would like to stress the need for the UN’ssystem of values to undergo an ongoing harmonization withnew challenges. In this framework  on behalf of theGovernment of Albania  I commend the efforts made underthe leadership of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  inthe process of reform of our Organization. We hail thepositive results achieved so far  and encourage the UnitedNations to continue to respond concretely to the challengesof the twenty-first century.Nearly three weeks ago Albania once again attractedthe attention of the United Nations due to the violent eventsaimed at striking a blow against the fragile democraticinstitutions that were under the process of restoration fromthe deep crisis my country passed through last year. Certainpolitical forces that lost their power in last year’s freeelections obviously encouraged the attack and occupation ofthe main State institutions.That attempt to overthrow violently the legitimateAlbanian Government was condemned by the wholedemocratic world  which strongly supported the Presidentof the Republic in his endeavour to reestablish the politicalequilibrium that had been deeply disturbed and to guaranteethe normal and democratic functioning of State powers andinstitutions. We highly appreciate this  and thank theinternational community for the support offered to Albaniaduring its difficult days  and we welcome the establishmentof the group of Friends of Albania. We view this as animportant instrument in our common efforts for the stabilityof Albania and the consolidation of State structures andinstitutions.We are conscious of the difficulties and negativephenomena with which we are coping. We are painfullyaware that the civilian population of Albania continues tobe considered the most armed in Europe. This is a realitywhich we have to face every moment. Taking intoaccount the threat that this poses not only to Albania butalso to the security of the region  our Government hasappealed the United Nations for assistance in this regard.Allow me on this occasion to thank the Secretary-Generalfor the seriousness with which he has dealt with thisproblem  and the Under-Secretary-General forDisarmament Affairs  Mr. Dhanapala  for the mission heled to Albania. I want to express our readiness to worktogether with the United Nations to collect the weaponswhich fell into the hands of the civilian population duringthe political unrest of 1997.I want to state that my Government is workingdiligently to establish the long-term rule of law in ourcountry. Through lengthy deliberations among Albania’spolitical forces  we have made an extensive endeavour todraft a constitution that recognizes the need to sharepolitical power and to secure human rights. It is mysincere hope that by the end of this year the Albanianpeople will be able to express their views on the proposeddraft constitution. The adoption of a constitution ratifiedby the people of Albania that recognizes the fundamentalrule of law and protects liberties will prepare Albania forcomplete integration into international structures. Mostimportant  this path offers the best and brightest hope forour country.I want also to address Albania’s economic situation.Rebuilding the economy has been the highest of prioritiesfor the Albanian Government  especially since the fall ofthe pyramid schemes which led to widespread micro- andmacroeconomic collapse and to the impoverishment ofmany Albanians. Our response to this crisis was directand decisive: in exposing the deceit of the pyramidschemes  in closing down the pyramid structures and inrebuilding trust in the Albanian economy. In cooperationwith the International Monetary Fund and the WorldBank  the assets of those firms were audited  and weinitiated the process of returning liquid assets tolegitimate creditors. Now I can declare with convictionthat pyramid-scheme-based businesses do not exist in ourcountry any more. We are working at present to createnew  active policies for employment  self-employment andprofessional training.The task of rebuilding Albania’s economy constitutesa great challenge that requires the support of the6international community. The Government has workeddiligently to break down Albania’s decades of isolationismand to become part of the world community of nations. Themain directions of our policy so far have been thefollowing.First  the engagement of Albania in Euro-Atlanticintegration is aimed at the creation of acceptable nationalstandards in accordance with the common Euro-Atlanticvalues of common security  human rights standards  and thepromotion of the liberal market-economy policies.Secondly  Albania’s cooperation with the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has also had concreteresults  expressed in successful cooperation  in theframework of the Partnership for Peace  on the qualificationof the Albanian army and police. The first Albaniancompany of peacekeepers has in fact made tangibleprogress in that direction.And thirdly  our cooperation with the European Union the Council of Europe and the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe has been further strengthened.It includes their assistance not only in the shaping andimprovement of Albanian legislation  but also in monitoringthe application of common standards. I take this opportunityto thank those institutions for their assistance and to expressonce again the willingness and the political commitment ofour Government to raise the quality of this cooperation inthe future.Albania’s cooperation with the European Union in theeconomic area remains a basis for multilateral cooperation.We consider membership in the World Trade Organizationto be vital in furthering the liberalization of Albaniantrading markets. In the meantime  we have strengthened ourrelations with international financial institutions  which havecommitted major financial resources to the economicdevelopment of Albania.On this occasion  please allow me to express mygratitude for the approval of the first United NationsDevelopment Programme country cooperation frameworkfor Albania  and my desire for the further strengthening ofcooperation between Albania and the United Nationssystem. Albania now has serious and powerful partners forthe development of our country. The Rome and Brusselsconferences will be followed by another follow-upconference in Tirana  at which we will assess our progressand make new commitments for the future.Turning to matters of international policy  theAlbanian Government has devoted much effort to regionalconcerns. Southeastern Europe has inherited a series ofproblems which are the political  economic  social psychological and institutional legacy of the communistera. However  we are deeply convinced that there areways and means to build up confidence  cooperation andfriendship among the Balkan nations. Albania hasembraced enthusiastically all the initiatives whichcultivate peace and cooperation in southeastern Europe such as the Central European Initiative  the Black SeaEconomic Cooperation process  the South-East EuropeanCooperative Initiative  the Royaumont Platform for Actionand the process of Balkan cooperation. All theseinitiatives will contribute to transparency of borders  freemovement of goods  people and opinions among thecountries of the region  and the setting up of commonvalues on trade  transport  energy  telecommunication andthe environment that will lay down the infrastructure forstability and peace in the region.Towards this goal  we have worked on substantiallyimproving bilateral relations with our neighbours.Significant steps were taken last year concerning relationswith Italy  Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia  on which a great number of cooperativeagreements were signed. Close partnership relations havedeveloped with Turkey  Bulgaria  Croatia  Romania Slovenia  et cetera.Although I am underlining these positive andencouraging aspects of regional cooperation in general and especially of Albania’s relations with its neighbours we cannot ignore the fact that in the Balkans there stillexist enclaves where fundamental human and nationalrights and freedoms  including the right to life  arebrutally violated every day. I am  of course  referring hereto the problem of Kosovo.I would like to confirm the conviction of theAlbanian Government that during the past months of theKosovo crisis  Belgrade has ignored the appeals of theinternational community to find an appropriate solution tothat situation  and has systematically destroyed thealternative of a peaceful solution  thus encouraging theoption of violence. Some days ago  the Security Counciladopted its resolution 1199 (1998)  attributing the mainresponsibility and blame for what is happening in Kosovoto the authorities in Belgrade. That resolution testified tounanimous political will on the part of the internationalcommunity to act strongly to find a peaceful  political7solution to the conflict  and left open the option of usingother means if failure is repeated.We hope that this time the clear warning given bySecurity Council resolution 1199 (1998)  the Council’sstrong message issued yesterday and the warnings given bythe NATO and world leaders  will be the last onesnecessary to impose a political solution on the authoritiesin Belgrade  something which they cannot realize bythemselves of their own will.The political archives of Belgrade are quite rich withfalse manoeuvres and untrue statements. The so-calledwithdrawal of special Serbian police forces from Kosovoand the end of fighting against so-called terrorists is a newversion of them. This is an old scenario of a Bosnian type and we Albanians have ample reasons not to believe it.What is happening today in Kosovo is the story of atragedy foretold. Milosevic´ has in fact ordered theimplementation of his “ethnic cleansing” policy againstAlbanians under the pretext of combating so-calledAlbanian terrorism. This has so far proved to be a constantelement of his strategy. In that way  Serbian propagandahas been trying to justify the indiscriminate attacks massacres and atrocities of the Yugoslav army against theAlbanian population of Kosovo  such as the ones seenlately in the media. Newborn children  pregnant women andelderly persons have been massacred in a bestial way. TheAlbanian Government strongly condemns this policy andopenly declares that Milosevic´ should be held accountableand responsible for genocide.The Albanian Government urges the following. First there should be strong and extensive internationalmonitoring and assisting presence in Kosovo. The nature ofthis presence should be in accordance with thedevelopments in the situation there. Secondly  there shouldbe an immediate NATO military intervention for peaceenforcement in Kosovo  as peaceful measures applied bythe international community have so far failed. Thirdly  theProsecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for theFormer Yugoslavia should start an investigation inaccordance with her mandate in order to indict Milosevic´ asa war criminal.The current conflict in Kosovo  as rightly pointed outin the resolutions and presidential statement of the SecurityCouncil  may have a strong spillover danger. Theneighbouring countries are directly affected not only by thewave of refugees  but also by its impact on the ethnic andpolitical relations inside these countries. We have alreadybeen witness to these effects.Albania has made its position quite clear. We are infavour of an immediate end to the conflict and theinitiation of negotiations between Belgrade and Prištinawith the international involvement of a third party. Thiswould guarantee their success. The negotiations shoulddefine the future status of Kosovo. The AlbanianGovernment strongly believes that any solution to theKosovo crisis should take into consideration and respectthe will of its inhabitants for self-determination inaccordance with the relevant international conventions.Humanitarian problems have always been the focusof attention of our Organization  which has also gainedvaluable experience on how to deal with them. I wouldlike to draw the Assembly’s attention to one the mostacute developments which has already been the object ofattention in United Nations bodies. Thousands of KosovoAlbanians — women  old people and children — haveleft their country and have gone as refugees to Albania Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia. Hundreds of thousands of others are nowhomeless  driven to wander in the forests and mountainsof Kosovo  constantly facing terror and death; and it isnow almost winter.In spite of the known difficulties  the AlbanianGovernment has taken all possible measures to cope withthe difficult situation which was created as a result of theinflux of Kosovo refugees in northern Albania. Albania in cooperation with specialized agencies  has actuallycreated suitable conditions to face the urgent need forfood and temporary shelter. We appeal to these agenciesto continue their assistance until this refugee crisis isresolved and Albanians can safely return to their homes.We are convinced that the United Nations and theSecurity Council will fulfil their responsibilities inaccordance with the United Nations Charter in the effortsto overcome the Kosovo crisis  which in fact has becomea crisis of the Balkans and Europe. It is high time theUnited Nations and other international forums urgentlyintervened for the restoration of peace; otherwise we riskhaving a wider conflict.On this occasion  I would like to thank the SecurityCouncil once again for the adoption of resolution 1199(1998) and to commend in particular the initiators of thatresolution  which constitutes an essential step in bringingpeace to Kosovo and stability to the region.8Albania  like many other countries  is being affectedby a set of phenomena such as drugs  illegal trafficking andorganized crime. The Albanian Government has takendetermined measures and is predisposed to cooperate withother countries to fight against these social scourges. Weheld a special session of the General Assembly this yeardevoted to the fight against drugs  as well as an opendebate in the Security Council on children in armedconflicts. These efforts testify to the special attention paidto these social problems  and our Government hails them.We appreciate the debate held by the Security Councilon Africa  the System-wide Special Initiative on Africa andthe engagement of the United Nations system for peace anddevelopment in Africa  a continent with incredible naturaland human potentials.My country also desires a peaceful solution to theconflict in the Middle East and the restarting of thedialogue between Israelis and Palestinians  in conformitywith the relevant international agreements and resolutionsof Security Council.We believe that the international community has oftenacted insufficiently in punishing the perpetrators of and thepeople politically responsible for crimes against mankind.Consequently  we appreciate the efforts made by the UnitedNations for the establishment of an International CriminalCourt  and we consider this a process of strengthening theconscience of the international community  as well as a stepforward in creating a collective positive reaction againstsuch crimes.The Albanian Government is of the opinion that theinstitutional reform of the United Nations is an ongoingprocess which is affected by the ever changing real world.The United Nations will be better able to face the newchallenges of the new millennium if the intergovernmentalinstitutions of the United Nations become even moredemocratic in their structure.One key area of such reform is the Security Council.Albania follows attentively the proceedings of the WorkingGroup for the restructuring of the Security Council and theefforts made to find a solution to this question. We are ofthe opinion that any decision to reform the Security Councilshould have the widespread support of member countriesand must take into account the new realities that areoccurring in international relations.The reform of United Nations  and especially of theSecurity Council  will be a reality only if there is a generalwill to provide the United Nations with the necessarypolitical support. Only then will this Organization leadour world to the common goal of the creation of a globalsociety of sovereign nations based on the rule of law respect for human rights  personal and religious liberties economic prosperity and international peace."
"4",137,"AND",53,1998,"I would firstlike to congratulate the President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-third session  Mr. Didier Opertti  of Uruguay and to give him Andorra?s unconditional support duringthis year of reforms. I would also like to thank theoutgoing President  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for hisimportant contribution to the debates of the fifty-secondGeneral Assembly.22We are now celebrating the fifth anniversary of theadmission of Andorra into the United Nations. It istherefore fitting to begin my speech today with anassessment of what motivated Andorra?s entry into theUnited Nations and the tasks that its Government hasaccomplished. Andorra wanted to become a part of theOrganization in 1993  immediately following approval bythe Andorran people of a modern Constitution that affirmedits sovereignty and brought to modern times thirteenth-century texts  texts which had guaranteed independence andneutrality for more than seven centuries. Andorra?sinternational standing required it.Nevertheless  neutrality has never signified forAndorra isolation or a lack of self-determination. To thecontrary  during times of great European conflicts  andduring the Spanish civil war  Andorra opened its doors tothose who fled terror and violence.Being a sanctuary of peace for so long has givenAndorra certain international responsibilities  enumerated inthe new Constitution of 1993  which says that the Andorranpeople shall persevere in the advancement of values such asjustice  democracy and social progress  and keep andstrengthen the harmonious relations of Andorra with therest of the world  based on mutual respect  coexistence andpeace in the desire to bring its strength and collaboration toall the common causes of mankind.The entry of Andorra into the United Nations has beena most important step for our country  giving us theopportunity to make ourselves heard  to express ourselvesand to be a part of the forum which includes all countries;we must respond with solidarity  aid and our best efforts toattain peace  liberty and full adhesion to the InternationalDeclaration of Human Rights.I am speaking in Catalan  the language of Andorra. Itis an old Latinate language  an important part of ourcultural identity  and it is an honour to speak these wordsin this language to the Assembly today. It is also proof ofone of the most difficult rights to assume: the right ofdifference.In Andorra  protected by the Pyrénées mountains  weare proud of our 720 years of uninterrupted peace and self-government. We have a population of over 65 000 composed of more than 60 nationalities. We have acquired with the passage of time  certain experience in conjugatingthe verb “to tolerate”  because of the diversity of ourpopulation  of which “Andorrans” are a minority  theimportance of immigration and the plurality of nationalities cultures and languages. These are facts  which conform tomodern societies.Permit me to expand on certain aspects of ourcountry in order to emphasize our desire to cooperate inshared projects and to struggle against aggression andrepression  and for harmony between peoples  culturesand civilizations. The particular sentiment that our littlecountry feels before this Assembly is appreciation of thedifference between globalization and particularity  theparadox between material progress and world poverty.Our confidence in this Assembly is absolute  and Ishall give two reasons. First  we consider here the grandstrategies we can adopt to pursue justice  democracy andthe rule of law. Secondly  this Assembly is a commonhouse  where all are equal under the law and all Statescan express their concerns to the world in an internationalassembly.The politics of Andorra at the United Nations inspireme to make a general reflection within this institution. Inthe last few years  the directives of the Government ofAndorra concerning United Nations reform have beenvery clear: absolute adherence to the reform projects ofthe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who  since hiselection  has worked to achieve the restructuring of thisOrganization.I am pleased to say that Mr. Annan is aided inseeking to attain his goals by the Deputy Secretary-General  who has helped him bring about his objectives and I would like to congratulate Mrs. Louise Fréchette who  in the months since she assumed her position  hashelped immensely in the difficult task of reforming thisinstitution  employing all the skills of a person of herdiplomatic abilities.With respect to the reform of the United Nations Andorra has shown a desire for transparency and greateraccess for the General Assembly to the workings of theSecurity Council. We would also like to make clear ourdesire for an increase in the membership of the SecurityCouncil  to reflect the increasing membership of theUnited Nations. The Working Group on the reform of theCouncil will sponsor debates and present alternatives  andwe will present our ideas.The most important theme of my speech today is thecelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. Andorra has strengthenedits political structures in the light  always brilliant of that231948 Declaration  which indeed  is given form in ourConstitution. Article 5 of this document incorporates it intothe judicial structure of the State in the phrase:“The Universal Declaration of Human Rights isbinding in Andorra.”This Declaration  shared by so many States  should notbe seen as Utopian. The proliferation of publications andseminars concerning the analysis and investigation ofhuman rights  understood more and more as a means ofensuring a proper relationship between the individual  thecommunity and the environment  touch on the grandsystems of classic thought.The practice is deceptive. At the international level none of us can ignore the paradox of great wealthcontrasted with the abuse  the aggression and the mostsinister forms of cruelty without limits. Today we knowmuch of what happens in the world and very probablymany of us know why. We cannot now return to ignorance to lack of knowledge  to lies.In a more immediate framework  we cannot argue thatthings are getting better. How can we respect the individualand his fundamental rights if the proliferation of armedconflicts  racism  xenophobia and the marginalization ofothers continues?Tolerance and respect are not new terms  but they arekey concepts  which must be reinvented or rediscovered given a greater significance and a universal application. Toooften tolerance is confused with condescension  and respectwith bureaucratic formality.The danger increases when we become blinded byabsolute truths and dogmatic positions which  in one wayor another  lead to authoritarianism and exclusion  whichare precisely the opposite of toleration and pluralism.This is written in the third book of the Pentateuch Leviticus:“Thou shalt not avenge  nor bear any grudgeagainst the children of thy people  but thou shalt lovethy neighbour as thyself”. (The Holy Bible  Leviticus19:18)These are old and perennial moral statements  which shapesociety  and which have always been universal valuesincorporated in all the great statements on human rights.On 10 December we will celebrate the passing of 50years since the signing of the Declaration. It has becomea banner of this body  and it gives it reason to exist andto work.There remain much work to be accomplished andmuch evil to be fought. We are far from any moment ofsatisfaction. This century  which is about to end  containsfew events of which we can reflect with satisfaction. Theworld has witnessed campaigns of extermination holocausts and wars. It has all been extremely cruel andbloody. We can still see this black light in countrieswhere assassinations take place under the guise ofredressing religious grievances.Many other examples can be cited to show that theuniversal application of human rights has not beenachieved  and we feel the same sense of powerlessnesswhen we see our friends and neighbours in theMediterranean dying on the southern borders of Europe.Those who survive are lifted out of the opulence ofEurope and deported  after false hopes and impossibledreams  back to the misery of their places of origin. Thisalso occurs  among other places  on the Adriatic coast.The Mediterranean is no longer the unifying sea thatit once was. Rather it has been transformed into a barrierbetween the rich North  with its aging populations  and aSouth that  like Prometheus  is filled with misery — butalso with young and struggling people more than half ofwhom are under 18. Can we not say  therefore  that aconflict is in the air? How far we have come from thestirring poem of Emma Lazarus  which  engraved on thebase of the Statue of Liberty  welcomed  with a door opento hope  the persecuted and the refugee.Will the justice system become a mere spectacle?Even great dignitaries of great democracies  elected in aclear-cut way  are denied strict respect for personal andfamily privacy. The death penalty is still in effect inmany countries. Child labour  child pornography  sexcrimes  abuse and mistreatment are everyday occurrences.Fifty years of universal human rights mean that wehave rules by which to differentiate between good andevil  and a standard by which we can recognize the ofteninconceivably evil actions of those individuals or Stateswho live without letting others live. Now  since 1948  wecannot turn away: we know who respects and who doesnot respect human rights.24The 1998 report of Amnesty International is onceagain the faithful portrait of a planet which is capable ofimmense technological progress and scientific advances thatwe can scarcely imagine  a planet with the ambition toconquer interstellar space  but nevertheless continues to bea world of terrible crimes. I do not believe that this shouldbe an anniversary during which we offer onlycongratulations; we should also reflect critically on how wemight effectively achieve respect for human rights. It isobvious that all of us here today have a clear understandingof the universality of human dignity: it is the mostfundamental and absolute of rights. We possess faith in thehuman being as the means of political action and the giverof concrete meaning to personal liberty and the freedom ofsocieties.Democracy is a synonym for ironclad respect forhuman rights  without concessions  as the greatest guaranteeof liberty and progress. What excuse could exist today fordefending the notion that people do not have the capacityto elect public officials and to send them home throughregular elections when those people believe that thepoliticians have not done well enough? It is clear thatdemocracy is vulnerable when there is no sincere consensuson the rules of the game  and that this will lead directly tototalitarianism  corruption and manipulation.Globalization is not only an economic phenomenon:with globalization  people have seen large States flowerwith democracy  and have seen that oppressive andauthoritarian regimes do not lead to lasting economicsuccess  as some have claimed.Many institutions have made excuses for sinscommitted 500  100  or 50 years ago. Must we wait half acentury to apologize for the barbarous acts we committoday? We all bear responsibility. We should not respondonly with words and good intentions  especially if wedeclare ourselves to be powerless before injustice andmisery. Action by States will be the only acceptableresponse  for even if every citizen of the world couldcooperate  we would still require force and the necessaryinstruments.What can Andorra  a small State  bring to this worldbody? Since 1993  my country has made a great legislativeeffort to accede to a large number of conventions  whichpermits us to participate in the rule of international law.From the point of view of security  Andorra desires toaccede promptly to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  with international solidarity as our goal.Our humanitarian tradition made us one of the firstcountries to have ratified the Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction.In the domain of international law  our presence atRome during the negotiation of the treaty on anInternational Criminal Court was marked by activeparticipation in the writing of the text  notably the firstparagraph of the statute. I would like to thank alldelegations who helped with the Andorran contribution and particularly the United States of America.Turning to international human rights legislation  wehave over the years endorsed many human rightsprovisions. Andorra will accede to the Council of EuropeConvention for the Protection of Human Rights andFundamental Freedoms  which includes the abolition ofthe death penalty. We are also a party to the EuropeanConvention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman orDegrading Treatment or Punishment. At the UnitedNations  we give priority to the Convention on the Rightsof the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of AllForms of Discrimination against Women.I have the pleasure today to announce that I havetaken the necessary steps to accede to other human rightsinstruments of which the Secretary-General is thedepositary  in particular the International Covenant onCivil and Political Rights and the Convention againstTorture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or DegradingTreatment or Punishment.We are concerned too about universal problems suchas terrorism  which must be combated without concession and illicit drug trafficking and the associated money-laundering  which must be prosecuted relentlessly.International cooperation and mutual assistance are theproper tools for this fight.From a financial point of view  our per capitacontribution is substantial  and we shall continue tocontribute to United Nations funds relating to humanrights  development and peacekeeping.In the field of preventive diplomacy  I insist on theimportance of words and diplomatic relations in movingthe world forward  and on the implementation of thememorandum of understanding successfully negotiated bythe Secretary-General last February on weapons25inspections in Iraq; our Ambassador is a member of theSpecial Group on Iraq?s presidential sites.I believe that small countries without enemies orhistorical conflicts are in a favourable position to conductdiscreet diplomacy and to play a mediation role to helpensure that important negotiations stay on track.In five years on the international stage  Andorra hasfound its place in the concert of nations  and we are veryproud to belong to this Organization. At the United Nations we have learned much from excellent teachers about howto go from the realm of the national to the international andfrom there to the universal. Andorra affirms before you itsbelief in human rights  at the same time as we stand forworld security  peace and preventive diplomacy.During the fifty-third session of the General Assembly Andorra will maintain this position and will work toparticipate in the reform of this international Organization for now is the moment  at the beginning of the newmillennium  to reinvigorate the United Nations  to make ita more effective instrument of order on this increasinglyglobalized planet.Today no one is innocent; we all share the sameresponsibilities. We wish to participate actively with all theMembers in tackling the task of building for a better age inan imperfect world in which all the peoples of the worldare increasingly interdependent and increasingly demand with greater determination and courage  the universalapplication of human rights."
"5",182,"ARE",53,1998,"I have thehonour to extend to the President the congratulations of thedelegation of the United Arab Emirates on his election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession. We are confident that his wise leadership and vastdiplomatic experience in international affairs will contributeto strengthening the role of the Organization in the worldtoday.I also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  Minister for Foreign Affairs ofUkraine  for the distinguished manner in which he directedthe work of the previous session. We also wish to expressour deep appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his endeavours to maintain peace  security andstability in the world.As we stand at the threshold of a new millennium  theinternational community is witnessing radical changes ininternational relations  the implications of which arereflected in the lives of peoples. The various aspects ofopenness and globalization embodied in some of thosechanges have not been comprehensive in their positiveaspects  but have resulted in widely divergent levels ofeconomic and social development among States and havepromoted the emergence of new patterns of problems thatrequire radical joint international solutions to contain anddeal with them.There is now an increased awareness in the world ofthe inevitability of renewing and developing the UnitedNations as the essential international tool for dealing withcurrent world problems and achieving balance  transparencyand justice in international relations.Consequently  we support the positions of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 regarding thesevital issues  particularly the questions within the purviewof the General Assembly and the Economic and SocialCouncil  and the reform of the Security Council andenlargement of its membership. We also call forstrengthening coordination  cooperation and dialoguebetween the United Nations and regional organizations inorder to mobilize and complement joint internationalefforts to deal with many issues on the agenda.The world has seen positive efforts in the area ofinternational law  the most important of which werereflected in the conclusion of a number of internationalconventions. The latest of these efforts was theestablishment in Rome of an International Criminal Court which we regard as an important step that will contributeto supporting the principles of human rights worldwide.We also call for reactivating the role of the InternationalCourt of Justice  which is the essential legal instrumentfor settling disputes between States.Political events in the world  and particularly in theArab Gulf region  have proved that radical solutions toregional disputes can only be achieved through peacefulmeans and methods based on the principles of the Charterof the United Nations and international law. Proceedingfrom this belief  and true to those principles  the UnitedArab Emirates has adopted a wise policy in its quest fora peaceful solution to the question of the occupation bythe Islamic Republic of Iran of its three islands —Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa — which forman integral part of our national sovereignty and territorialintegrity.The continued consolidation by Iran of its illegaloccupation of those islands and the imposition of a policyof fait accompli through numerous military and civilianmeasures designed to change their historical  demographicand legal characteristics are a source of grave tension andconcern in the region. This runs counter to good-neighbourly relations  peaceful coexistence andconfidence-building  as well as to the Charters of both theUnited Nations and the Organization of the IslamicConference. Such actions are also incompatible with theapproaches taken by the members of the Gulf CooperationCouncil  which call for the settlement of existing disputesby peaceful means in order to achieve permanent securityand stability in the region and strengthen relations andcommon interests between the States members of the GulfCooperation Council and Iran.22Accordingly  once again from this rostrum we appealto the Government of friendly Iran to demonstrate a seriouspolitical will and accept our genuinely peaceful initiative supported by all fraternal and friendly States  either toengage with us in dialogue and enter into bilateralnegotiations that would address the legal and historicalbackground of this question  not just its formalities  oraccept resort to the International Court of Justice with aview to reaching a just and permanent settlement conduciveto terminating the Iranian occupation of our three islands.Once again we reaffirm that our call for solving this disputepeacefully emanates from the nature of our historicalrelations with Iran and proceeds from our commitment tothe essential principles governing international relations.This is also in the interest of preserving peace  security andstability in our region and throughout the world.The United Arab Emirates renews its support for allpeaceful efforts and endeavours by the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations towards resumption of the activities ofthe Special Commission in Iraq. But we consider itnecessary  in order to avoid any further escalation orrenewed tensions in the region  and in the light of theimportance of preserving the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of Iraq and non-interference in its internationalaffairs  to continue upgrading the food-for-oil programmeand improving its operation in order to meet thehumanitarian needs of the fraternal Iraqi people and toalleviate its ceaseless suffering. At the same time  we urgethe Iraqi Government to fully implement all the relevantresolutions of international legitimacy particularly thoserelating to the release of the prisoners of war and detainees citizens of sisterly Kuwait and other States  and to completethe restitution of Kuwaiti property so as to ensure the liftingof the sanctions imposed on Iraq and to enable it to resumeits natural role at the regional and international levels.The Middle East peace process is at a dangerousstalemate on all its tracks as a result of the adoption by theIsraeli Government of a policy of gradual recanting on allthe obligations and undertakings it has assumed under thisprocess. The most dangerous aspect of that policy is thatGovernment’s resolve to proceed with implementing itsplans for building more Jewish settlements in the occupiedPalestinian and other Arab territories  particularly in the cityof Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan. It daily perpetratesatrocious and inhuman crimes against the Palestinian andother Arab peoples  which constitutes a flagrant violation ofthe basic principles on which that process and the FourthGeneva Convention of 1949 are based.Aware of the danger inherent in the continuation ofthese illegal Israeli acts  we believe there is a need foreffective action by the international community — inparticular  the co-sponsors of the peace process and theEuropean Union — to bring additional pressure to bear onIsrael to force it to comply with its legal obligations andto demand that it resume the negotiations  withoutpreconditions  on the different tracks of the peace process on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)and 338 (1973) and the principle of land for peace. Wealso express our unceasing support for the Palestinianpeople in their quest for self-determination and theirlegitimate aspiration to establish their independent Stateon their national soil  with Jerusalem as its capital.Similarly  we support the position of the Government ofLebanon  demanding that Israel implement fully SecurityCouncil resolution 425 (1978)  which calls on Israel toend unconditionally its military occupation of the south ofLebanon and its western Bekaa valley without condition.The establishment of a zone free of all kinds ofweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and ArabGulf regions is a requirement that complements the peaceprocess and represents an essential factor in the securityand stability of those regions. Accordingly  theinternational community should demand that theGovernment of Israel accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and subject itsnuclear installations to the control and safeguards regimeof the International Atomic Energy Agency. Internationalmeasures which so far have been achieved in the area ofworld disarmament have not been global in theircoverage  especially since we are witnessing an arms raceand testing of nuclear and other proscribed weapons. Suchdevelopments will not lead to the settlement of existingdisputes between States  but  rather  to an imbalance inregional security  as is the case between India andPakistan and in other regions.We therefore urge both friendly countries to exerciseself-restraint  renounce the use of force and resumedialogue and negotiations with a view to reducingtensions and solving their current disputes peacefully ina manner that will serve the interests of security andstability in that region. We also call upon the nuclear-weapon States  and those in possession of such dangerousweapons  to reconsider their policies  to refrain fromapplying double standards and to promote the adoption ofequal measures for confidence-building among States.Serious steps must be taken by the United Nations to dealwith this shortcoming in a way that contributes to thecreation of a peaceful and stable world free from tension23and from the threat or use of such prohibited weapons andtheir damaging effects on humanity.While we appreciate the efforts of the United Nationspeacekeeping forces  in cooperation with the regionalorganizations  to deal with and contain conflicts and civiland regional wars in certain parts of the world  we are stillconcerned about the failure to contain several crises inother parts of the world  such as Afghanistan  Somalia  theGreat Lakes region  Angola and other hotbeds of tension.Recent examples are the situations between Ethiopia andEritrea and between Iran and Afghanistan  as well as thatin Kosovo  where the human rights of Muslims are beingflagrantly violated by the Yugoslav Serb forces  whoseactions we strongly condemn as contradicting legallybinding international norms and principles. The UnitedNations  and the Security Council in particular  mustassume their responsibilities in putting an end to suchconflicts and violations and should promote theparticipation of regional organizations in finding adequatepeaceful solutions to those problems. We also call upon theparties concerned to cooperate in such efforts bydemonstrating the political will necessary to settle theirdisputes by peaceful means.The United Arab Emirates strongly condemns theterrorist acts that were carried out recently in some AfricanStates  resulting in heavy losses of lives and property. Onthe basis of ethical and humanitarian responsibility  theinternational community should intensify its efforts toprotect civilians and their rights and to confront thephenomenon of terrorism  regardless of its origin or form.However  combating this dangerous phenomenon should notbe carried out on a unilateral basis or throughindiscriminate military revenge  which destroys lives andproperty  but through joint international action within theframework of the United Nations in order to ensure theelimination of all the root causes and manifestations ofterrorism and thereby preserve the security and stability ofsocieties and the territorial integrity of States.The world economic and financial environmentcontinues to undergo numerous challenges which havevarying implications for development. Despite theliberalization of trade  the open markets and theglobalization of the economy that have characterizedinternational relations  developing countries  representing amajority of the population of this planet  are still facing amultitude of problems especially together with theexacerbation of unemployment  illiteracy and poverty  inaddition to debts and the cost of servicing them  declininghumanitarian and development assistance which havebecome a heavy burden on many of those States particularly the least developed countries. As a result their development problems have increased  and that inturn has led to the creation of a state of instability andsocial disintegration.Recent economic and financial crises in South-EastAsia and other regions not only pose challenges tosustainable development  but also demonstrate that thereare clear imbalances in the world monetary  economic andtrade systems. Therefore  we call for the development ofglobal economic and financial strategies to remedy thereal causes of this phenomenon in order to achievestability in the world financial  economic and tradesystems. This will also require the reform of internationaldevelopment and financial institutions to enable them toadapt to the changing economic situation in the world andeffectively contribute to addressing many of thoseproblems. That in turn will require the initiation ofcomprehensive and objective North-South dialogue  whichshould lead to the fulfilment of the goals shared by boththe developing and developed countries.In conclusion  I hope that the deliberations of theAssembly at this session will succeed in reaching positiveresolutions that address our concerns as they are reflectedon the agenda for this session for the benefit  prosperity security and stability of our States and peoples."

The economic and financial crisis that concerns ustoday should boost our commitment to the economicreform process which we are carrying out in our region.Trade and foreign investment are clearly sources ofopportunity and incentives to growth and competitiveness.But it is also clear that in recent decades the freemovement of capital flows has been one of the mainengines of economic development for many countries.19In order to dispel its negative effects  globalizationrequires educational  social and environmental policies thatbenefit all of society in a balanced and equitable manner.We feel it is damaging to succumb to the temptation ofimposing restrictions on international trade in order tothwart the spread of economic crisis  or to resort tohampering or placing conditions on the flow of financialresources in order to moderate their volatility.In Latin America  countries such as Argentina havemade sustained and coherent efforts to consolidate theirfinancial situation  contain the budget deficit and provideassurances to foreign investment by helping to create asolid economic environment for the region  which isincreasingly being seen with new eyes.A few days ago  the Presidents of the Rio Group meeting in Panama  expressed their resolve to continuemanaging economic policy mechanisms in a responsiblemanner that guarantees stability and growth. Accordingly financial institutions and those countries with the capacityto provide assistance should understand the problems thatthis critical economic situation presents to countries thatfind themselves in the eye of the storm and act accordingly.The Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR)is today a model of economic foundations based onfreedom and democracy in which cooperation is the veryessence of the system.As an illustration of the excellent relations in the areaof security and defense  Argentina pressed for the adoptionof the Political Declaration of MERCOSUR  Bolivia andChile as a Zone of Peace  which was signed at theMERCOSUR summit held in Argentina on 24 July 1998.The recent nuclear tests in South Asia constituted astep backwards with regard to regional and global security.These tests delay the economic development and well-beingof the population. Argentina  together with countries thathave renounced the military use of nuclear technology  hasurged the States of that region to stop conducting tests andto adhere to the international instruments in force.Argentina  for its part  has offered to share fully itsexperience in peaceful nuclear cooperation. Allow me torecall that Argentina was the first country that  havingmastered the nuclear fuel cycle  chose to limit its own useof this technology.We feel proud of the steps our country has taken inthe last decade related to non-proliferation issues. In thenuclear field  we ratified the Treaty for the Prohibition ofNuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean(Treaty of Tlatelolco) in 1994 and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1995  andhave become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.In the chemical and bacteriological field  we havepromoted the Joint Declaration on the CompleteProhibition of Chemical and Biological Weapons â€” theMendoza Agreement â€” of 1991  a commitment originallylimited to Argentina  Brazil and Chile  which was laterextended to most Latin American countries. We have alsoadjusted our domestic legislation strictly to controlexports related to dual-use chemical  bacteriological andmissile-related substances and technologies  in accordancewith existing international instruments. Last July  as afollow-up to the Mendoza Agreement  we adopted theUshuaia Declaration  which established the Southern ConeCommon Market (MERCOSUR) as an area free ofweapons of mass destruction. Hence  Argentina has takenthe decision to assume greater responsibility in this field.In turn  this decision has allowed us to continueexchanges of advanced technology.In relation to conventional weapons  we stronglysupport the United Nations Register of ConventionalArms  to which we regularly provide information. Wealso support other important initiatives recently adoptedwithin the framework of the Organization of AmericanStates (OAS)  such as the Inter-American Conventionagainst the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking inFirearms  Ammunition  Explosives  and Other RelatedMaterials and Other Appropriate Actions. Small armsconstitute another source of international concern. It isworth mentioning that regional and international seminarshave recently been held in Buenos Aires on this topic.We are not indifferent to the grave scourge ofantipersonnel mines. In 1995  Argentina established amoratorium on the export of mines and more recently  inDecember 1997 at Ottawa  I had the honour to sign  onmy countryâs behalf  the Convention on the Prohibition ofthe Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.In our hemisphere we work earnestly and in a spiritof compromise to overcome all differences by means ofnegotiation. As we gradually resolve the few pendingbilateral disputes  we will definitively consolidate ourregion as a zone of peace. We trust that in comingmonths we shall see important developments in thatregard. Friendship among peoples is the best guaranteeagainst conflict.20We are convinced that the United Nations presence inHaiti  in keeping with the desire of the Government of thatcountry  will help to consolidate democracy and contributeto the prosperity of the Haitian people.The resurgence of terrorist attacks comes as a harshreminder that no State is immune to terrorism. My countryfirmly supports the initiatives under way to supplement withnew conventions the network of anti-terrorism norms nowin force  leading to enhanced international cooperation andto establishing the obligation of all States to bring to justiceand punish those responsible for these acts. The ArgentineGovernment continues to make every effort to clarify theacts of terrorism committed against the Israeli embassy andthe Argentine Israelite Mutual Association in Buenos Aires.Let me highlight the fact that on 2 September 1998 theArgentine Republic signed the International Convention forthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. Likewise  nextNovember Argentina will host the second specialized inter-American conference on terrorism.Severe global humanitarian crises  usuallyaccompanied by forced displacement of populations constitute another issue that affects international peace andsecurity. Argentina has joined in the internationalcommunityâs efforts  with bilateral assistance programmesand with such initiatives as the â€œWhite Helmetsâ€ initiative.In that context  intergovernmental and non-governmentalorganizations devoting their energies to the solution of thistype of crisis deserve our recognition.To grow and develop  peoples need to live in peace.We are dismayed to see that conflicts which could beovercome  such as those in Cyprus  the Middle East  theGreat Lakes region of Africa  Angola and the Balkans particularly Kosovo  persist in spite of the internationalcommunityâs efforts to resolve them. The situation ofrefugees  especially children  who are victims of theseconflicts is a source of particular concern.In 1998 Argentina will mark the fortieth anniversaryof its participation in peacekeeping operations. Ourcontribution has cost the lives of Argentine citizens whohelped to make this a more secure and stable world. Thevast experience acquired over these 40 years has beenembodied in the Argentine joint training centre forpeacekeeping operations  and in the Argentine gendarmerietraining centre that specializes in civilian police operationsabroad.Argentinaâs natural interest in the South Atlantic isreflected in our participation in the Zone of Peace andCooperation of the South Atlantic  which brings together24 African and Latin American countries from bothshores of the Atlantic. I am particularly proud toannounce that  on 21 and 22 October  Argentina will bethe site of the fifth Ministerial Meeting of the countriesmembers of the Zone.Unfortunately  there remains an important unresolvedissue in the South Atlantic: the sovereignty disputebetween the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdomof Great Britain and Northern Ireland over the MalvinasIslands  a dispute whose existence has been unequivocallyrecognized in many resolutions of the General Assemblyand of the Special Committee on the Situation with regardto the Implementation of the Declaration on the Grantingof Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  aswell as in various other international forums. I reiterate with the same conviction as always  the legitimate andwell-founded rights of Argentina in that long-standingdispute. And  with the same conviction as always  I urgethe United Kingdom to heed the call of the internationalcommunity and observe United Nations resolutions callingupon both Governments to resume negotiations on allaspects of this question.The end of the cold war showed us that far morecomplicated problems have been resolved through frank open dialogue and with a determination to reach amutually acceptable agreement. I see no reason why thequestion of the Malvinas Islands should be an exception.Proceeding on firm footing  we have rebuilt our bilateralrelationship and  for the benefit of the Argentine andBritish peoples  have strengthened political  trade andcultural ties. Evidence of this is the visit which PresidentCarlos Menem is to make to the United Kingdom in thenear future  for which both parties are engaged inenthusiastic preparations and which has generated highexpectations at all levels.Similarly  we have left behind the misgivings andresentments of the past  learning from our mistakes andcreating a climate of mutual trust in the South-WestAtlantic  which is today enabling us to cooperate in theconservation of fishery resources and in exploration forhydrocarbons. That cooperation renders still moreincomprehensible todayâs lack of communication betweenthe islands and the mainland. There are few places in theworld with such an unnatural situation. It is beyond doubtthat restoring direct ties between the mainland and the21islands would contribute to resolving the problem. We haveno doubt about this.Once again  I expressly reiterate Argentinaâs sinceredesire to pursue a frank dialogue without preconditions. Wehope that the British Government understands the fullmeaning of our offer and that it will respond accordingly.To the islanders I reiterate our unwavering commitment tofull and unconditional respect for their way of life  theirculture and their institutions. Our national constitution soprovides  and that is the desire of the Argentine people.There have been concrete advances on vital questions.The creation of a permanent international criminal court isone such example. Similarly  the recent special session ofthe General Assembly devoted to the world problem ofdrugs adopted innovative documents of great importance.This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and of the adoptionof the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of theCrime of Genocide. In these 50 years  the internationalcommunity has become aware of the vital importance ofhuman rights: today it no longer accepts what was oncetolerated.The deterioration of the environment  in its variousforms  is one of the problems urgently requiring concreteanswers and effective commitment by governments andcivil society. Argentina will have the honour of hosting thefourth Conference of the Parties to the FrameworkConvention on Climate Change  from 2 to 13 November ofthis year.We are convinced that a substantial part of our effortsto reform the Organization should be geared to designing amechanism of closer and more effective cooperation withthe Bretton Woods institutions.With regard to reform of the Security Council  webelieve that situations born out of the Second World Warcannot prevail indefinitely. It is necessary to finddemocratic solutions that will allow for periodic renewalwithin the modalities preferred by each region. The viabilityof this reform will necessarily depend on the degree ofconsensus reached. There are several aspects to be borne inmind. The first is that the reform must be legally valid which means not forcing interpretations of the Charter withregard to the majorities required by Article 108. Further the reform must be founded on political legitimacy. Anyincrease in the number of permanent members should allowfor a rotation open to all States of the respective regions.The crisis of our Organization is fundamentally one ofparticipation. Many small and medium-sized countriesfeel excluded. Only by allowing greater participation inthe Security Council will we be living up to thedemocratic ideals of the end of this century.The vitality of democratic ideals in the region wasconfirmed with the signing on 24 July of the Ushuaiaprotocol  which reaffirms the democratic clause in thecountries of the Southern Cone Common Market(MERCOSUR)  Bolivia and Chile.The visit by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan to the countries of our region last July was a verysignificant event. Argentina had the opportunity todemonstrate its clear commitment to assuming its globalresponsibilities. The Secretary-General recognized this especially as regards peacekeeping."
"7",254,"ARM",53,1998,"May I begin  Sir  by congratulating you on your election asPresident of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.I am confident that the skills and vast experience you haveacquired throughout your distinguished diplomatic careerwill provide the guidance we need to guarantee thesuccessful outcome of the session. I must also recall thevaluable contribution of your predecessor  Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  to the work of the last session of the GeneralAssembly.This year  1998  has been a year of warning signalsand signs of hope. We have witnessed both setbacks andstrides forward in the quest for peace and internationalsecurity. In particular  we have witnessed great progresstowards the settlement of one of the longest and mostintractable conflicts — that of Northern Ireland. The Irishpeace agreement has proved to the world that it is nevertoo late to find answers to seemingly impossibleproblems.Unfortunately  wars  armed conflicts  acts ofterrorism and other forms of violence have shaken theworld during this last year and have had a negativeimpact on international stability and security.A party to all international treaties in the sphere ofthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction Armenia is deeply concerned about the possibleconsequences of nuclear tests conducted by India andPakistan this year. We believe that as the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) comes into force  it willcontribute substantially to the strengthening ofinternational security. Also  within the framework of theConference on Disarmament  Armenia supports draftingagreements on the prohibition of the production of fissilematerials for nuclear weapons and other explosivedevices.The United Nations plays a great role in differentaspects of international life  ranging from tackling globalenvironmental problems to combating organized crimeand illicit drug trafficking. In support of United Nationsactivities in these spheres  Armenia actively participatedin the twentieth special session of the General Assembly.We strongly believe that the illicit traffic in drugs andpsychotropic substances seriously jeopardizes the economicprosperity and political stability of many countries andregions of the world.Armenia also actively participated in activities leadingto the establishment of the International Criminal Court since we attach great importance to the battle againstinternational crime  including the crime of genocide  crimesagainst humanity and war crimes. Believing that the UnitedNations should play the leading role in the formation of aninternational anti-criminal strategy  Armenia supports theidea of holding  in Vienna  in the year 2000  the tenthUnited Nations Congress on Crime Prevention andTreatment of Offenders.Armenia unequivocally condemns all acts of terrorismas acts that have no justification on political  ideological ethnic  religious or any other grounds. The recent terroristattacks in Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania onceagain show us the necessity for cooperation among allcountries to combat that evil. We call for the accession ofthe maximum number of countries to universal conventionsagainst terrorism  and support the Russian proposal on aUnited Nations convention for combating acts of nuclearterrorism. Armenia likewise supports including on theagenda of the fifty-third session of the General Assemblyissues dealing with the declaration by the United Nations ofa decade of international law  as well as events to beorganized in 1999 devoted to the hundredth anniversary ofthe first International Peace Conference.For the international community  this year marks thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. The semi-centennial anniversary of the Declarationenables the States Members of the United Nations toconduct a review of human rights conditions in their owncountries and to identify ways further to develop thefoundations of democracy and to promote human andnational rights.This year also marks the fiftieth anniversary of theadoption of the Convention on the Prevention andPunishment of the Crime of Genocide. It is well known thatthe international community did not  at the time  dulycondemn the genocide of Armenians in the OttomanEmpire in 1915  and that failure encouraged certain regimesto commit new crimes of genocide. After the Holocaust  theUnited Nations addressed the problem of genocide  definingit as a crime against humanity  and adopted  on 9 December1948  the aforementioned Convention. Despite that fact over the past five decades  crimes of genocide have beencommitted in various parts of the world on more than oneoccasion. The recent recognition and condemnation byseveral parliaments of the genocide of Armenianscommitted early in this century is evidence of anincreased understanding of the necessity to combat thatevil.The General Assembly  upon the submission ofArmenia and five other Member States  included on theagenda of this session an item on the fiftieth anniversaryof the genocide Convention. We hope that  by combiningits efforts in the struggle against the crime of genocide humanity will take a decisive step towards the eliminationof that crime in the next century.Equality and mutually beneficial cooperation amongcountries in the political and commercial-economicspheres  based on free market principles  should becomean important factor for political stability in the thirdmillennium. We have no other choice. Armenia adheresto this policy in all its dealings  from its approach tocooperation with international organizations to the processof becoming a member of the World Trade Organization.We attach special significance to regionalcooperation  be it in the framework of the Commonwealthof Independent States  the Black Sea EconomicCooperation organization or the TRASECA project.Armenia is sincerely open to such cooperation  althoughwe have to state with regret that the blockade imposed onArmenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan is a serious obstacleto such cooperation. It is obvious that the region?s vastpotential cannot be fully exploited if attempts are made toisolate one of its constituents. Such attempts are doomedto failure.Another factor of concern for political-militarystability in the region is the gross violation by Azerbaijanof the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.In three categories of ground equipment identified in theTreaty  our neighbour significantly surpasses the nationallimits set by the Treaty.Despite the potential threat to our security  since theearliest days of our independence we have clearly andunambiguously forsworn the development of weapons ofmass destruction and adhere to the principles of non-proliferation of such weapons and of control over thedestabilizing accumulation of conventional arms.The peaceful settlement of regional conflicts is oneof the most important safeguards of stability and peace inour region  the Transcaucasus. Armenia is committed to2the ceasefire established in the Karabakh zone of conflict inMay 1994 and will assist in its rigorous maintenance. Weemphasize the contribution of the Minsk Group and of itsindividual member States  both to the maintenance of theceasefire and to mediation.Unfortunately  at present  the negotiation process is atan impasse. We believe that the main reasons for thisimpasse are the unclear definition of Nagorny Karabakh?sstatus as a party to the negotiations; Azerbaijan?s refusal tonegotiate directly with the leaders of Nagorny Karabakh;and its insistence on preconditions regarding the futurestatus of Nagorny Karabakh  which we believe must benegotiated. The international community must make everyeffort to overcome these obstacles.In our opinion  given the intensity and specifics of theNagorny Karabakh conflict  its resolution demandsunconventional approaches based on the principle of equallegal rights for the parties to the conflict  an end to theenclave status of Nagorny Karabakh and the provision ofinternational security guarantees for its population. Armeniais ready to move forward and calls on Azerbaijan to resumenegotiations without preconditions in order to reach acomprehensive settlement for the Nagorny Karabakhconflict.The challenges that the international community facestoday are diverse and complicated. We are convinced thatonly a reformed United Nations can cope successfully andeffectively with the increasing number of problems. Thisholds true especially for the reform of the Security Council since the maintenance of peace and security throughout theworld depends on a Security Council that functionseffectively. We also call for deeper institutional reform ofthe United Nations  including in the administrative-budgetary sphere. We believe that the fulfilment by allMember States of their financial obligations under theUnited Nations Charter is indispensable if theOrganization?s acute financial crisis is to be overcome.Despite serious economic hardships  Armenia will fulfil itsduties in this sphere. We need only recognize that astronger and reformed United Nations serves our commoninterests."
"8",287,"ATG",53,1998,"On behalf of theGovernment and people of Antigua and Barbuda  I wouldlike to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to presideover the General Assembly at this fifty-third session. Youare well known to envoys from my country who haveworked with you and who can attest to your humanistic andunprejudiced vision of the world. We feel confident thatunder your guidance this will be a productive session. Ilikewise wish to express my country’s recognition to yourpredecessor  Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine  for the skilfulmanner in which he conducted the work of the fifty-secondsession. I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General  who isentrusted with the advancement of this Organization at sucha critical time in history. I am also grateful to theSecretariat for scheduling Antigua and Barbuda in this slot.This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of theCaribbean Community (CARICOM)  of which Antigua andBarbuda is a proud member. Despite the utterances of theprophets of doom  CARICOM did much more than survive and the areas of cooperation deepened and widened. Whatstarted as a free-trade arrangement has expanded  and isnow marked by a number of significant institutions in areassuch as education and health  as well as in sports andculture. This year the Order of the Caribbean Communityaward was given to four individuals  among them theformer Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda  the RightHonourable Vere Cornwall Bird  appropriately dubbed “Thefather of the Nation”. In accepting the award  the formerPrime Minister stated:“despite the difficulties  we have erected fineinstitutions — institutions that are a tribute to theresourcefulness of our leaders and the support of thepeople. But  difficult as they were to build  it is easyfor them to be tumbled unless today’s leaders andpeople are prepared to safeguard and preserve them.To do so requires the same vision  the samedetermination and the same spirit of selflessness thatmotivated the previous generation.”I assure you  Mr. President  that the spirit that hementioned is steadfast among us  and that there is noturning back.Peace  security and disarmament are vital to a safeand secure planet  and the countless individuals who livedaily in constant fear  whether in regard to terrorists hatred between ethnic groups  internecine warfare orreligious persecution  give us much concern. Added tothat is the expanding nuclear rivalry. The nuclear club isno longer exclusive to the five permanent members of theSecurity Council. The question to be posed is whether thefive long-time nuclear Powers will now accept that theonly way to prevent nuclear proliferation is to abolish allnuclear weapons  a factor that has been repeatedlystressed in debates within these hallowed walls and inGeneral Assembly resolutions. Or will the club quicklymove beyond the present seven members? We urge thatthis matter be given the serious consideration it deserves as we must commit ourselves to future generations. Butwe are presently dismayed about the future of the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) andthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).Irrespective of the high praise given to globalization to most of the developing world it hurts  and hurtsexcessively. For the past four years — that is  since theestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) —disturbing signs have emerged of trends which point inthe direction of exclusion rather than inclusion  and ofmarginalization rather than integration. And these trendsare now having a serious negative effect on countrieswhich recently were optimistically viewing theirprospects.The multilateral financial institutions  which provideresources to developing countries at concessional rates continue  despite numerous protests and logical argumentspresented to them  to use gross national product as a basisfor judging our economic wherewithal. Somehow globalization and liberalization will work magic irrespective of the existing and deep-seated problems ofsmall States  it is assumed. The case of bananas must behighlighted. The undoing of the Lomé trade agreement with the injury which this hostile act can inflict on thesmall banana-exporting countries of the Organization ofEastern Caribbean States  of which Antigua and Barbudais a member  gives grave cause for concern. Small  peaceloving States  causing no harm to any other State underthe terms of the Lomé agreement  have found themselvesyoked by the World Trade Organization ruling. Withoutsome form of protection  the banana industry in the10CARICOM States could collapse  leading to severe socialdislocation  which would ultimately manifest itself inpolitical catastrophe.The multilateral trading system needs to be fair andequitable  and the imbalances in the present agreementsshould be rectified. The benefits of the system shouldaccrue to all States in relation to their needs  and not inproportion to their share in international trade. There needsto be recognition of the serious limitations of the principleof reciprocity as an instrument for mutually advantageoustrading arrangements when the participating countries havedifferent levels of development. The WTO must contributeto achieving positive coherence in global economic policy.Widespread and equitably shared economic growthwill surely benefit all. In fact  the developed countries willbe important beneficiaries of the economic growth anddevelopment of developing countries  which will providelarger markets and better opportunities  respectively  fortheir products and investment. This will also lead to globalpeace and prosperity  ensuring a truly stable framework forinternational relations based on mutuality of benefits.My Government welcomed the twentieth specialsession of the General Assembly on the world drugproblem  held between 8 and 10 June 1998. In theCaribbean the Non-Self-Governing Territories have thesame problems in regard to narcotics as the independentcountries. There is a multidimensional thrust upon ourentities  as there is a challenge to governability by nonState actors and the drug operators. The influence of thedrug-traffickers forces our Governments to shift verylimited resources from development priorities to lawenforcement and the rehabilitation of addicts. The socialerosion  economic dislocation and increase in criminalactivity mean that for small societies striving to overcomeeconomic vulnerability it becomes a tremendous challengeto maintain functioning institutions in an environment withthe potential for decreased productivity.Quite frankly  there is the possibility for all of us tobecome the involuntary victims of the drug trade. It is nosecret that the small island developing States and low-lyingcoastal States of the Caribbean have inadequate defencesagainst the vast resources of the drug-traffickers. Inaddition  if we are not sufficiently fearful of the devastationthat can be caused by the illicit traffic in narcotics  we mustbe gravely concerned about the destruction that canaccompany the attendant traffic in small arms andammunition. In one of the most comprehensive plans ofaction on Caribbean policy and development  the WestIndian Commission noted that nothing poses greaterthreats to civil society in CARICOM countries than thedrug problem; and nothing exemplifies the powerlessnessof regional Governments more.My Prime Minister addressed the issue ofpowerlessness of regional Governments in a recentstatement to the Caribbean Studies Association. In thatstatement he referred to the dictatorial approach taken bycertain countries. Given our limited capabilities  weacknowledge the importance of cooperation to developmechanisms that can respond to incidents of drugtrafficking. We encourage collaboration  therefore  whereappropriate  to achieve the desired results — theapprehension and conviction of criminals.Allow me to speak briefly on the subject ofalternative development policies. Antigua and Barbudaand indeed other Caribbean countries that introduced anoffshore financial services sector did so as a directresponse to the perceived need to diversify our economiesin the face of globalization and trade liberalization. Onthe one hand  when we choose the financial servicessector and follow the example of other countries that havedone so before us  we are labelled as havens for moneylaunderers and corruption  and steps are taken toundermine our efforts and limit the competitive advantagethat we may enjoy. We do not believe that this approachlends itself to genuine partnership and mutual respect.What we need is collaboration  information exchange andtechnical support to assist us in ensuring that our financialservices sector is not abused by dubious sources while itprovides us with much needed economic resources.History clearly proves that drug abuse and illicittrafficking know no boundaries; no country is inoculatedagainst their effects. It is logical to conclude  therefore that the fight against drug-trafficking and abuse musttranscend any individual country strategy.My Government supports an unbiased approach tothe United Nations thematic agenda on drug control forthe twenty-first century. The decision to focus on demandreduction  elimination of illicit crops  judicial cooperation money-laundering  stemming illicit production of syntheticdrugs and the control of drug-production chemicals mustbe consistent with the desire for a global strategy againstdrug-trafficking. The transnational nature of the drugproblem warrants such concerted action to create thedrug-free world that we all desire.11Antigua and Barbuda is committed to this globalstrategy. We have signed a number of interdictionagreements and appointed an official to coordinate nationalaction against drug-trafficking and related crimes. Thisofficial works closely with the Attorney General to ensureformulation and implementation of the national drug policy.In addition to the policy initiatives  we are currentlycompleting work on a drug treatment facility that we hopewill be used not only as a centre for rehabilitation  but alsoas a training facility in the region.It seems logical that a word should be said here inregard to the adoption of the Statute for the InternationalCriminal Court  as Caribbean nations had hoped that sucha Court would aid in the elimination of the narcoticscourge. The media did not  to any significant extent diffuse the idea that it was a Caribbean country  Trinidadand Tobago  that revived the idea for an internationalcriminal court after a lapse of 41 years. In 1989 Trinidadand Tobago reintroduced to the United Nations the conceptof 1948.But the specific reasons for establishing the Court asadvanced by Trinidad and Tobago and other States of theCaribbean Community were put on the back burner. Wehad pleaded for a Court that would try to sentence thoseinvolved in the trans-shipment of narcotics  in terrorism andin marine abuses  including the violation of our territorialwaters. What is before us is a Court emphasizing genocide war crimes  crimes against humanity and the crime ofaggression. All of these we support  yet we are faced witha clear indication that we are still on the periphery.The West Indies have always been on the periphery ofdominant economic systems — in reference  that is  to thepost-Columbian era. The West Indies  since the initialperiod of colonization  have provided goods and servicesfor more advanced industrial entities. The very nature ofour colonization — that is  to exist as colonies ofexploitation as opposed to colonies of settlement —demanded continued underdevelopment. The sad thing isthat  today  the multilateral financial institutions whichprovide resources to developing countries at concessionalrates continue to use gross national product as a basis forjudging our economic wherewithal. The present situation inregard to my country provides a most germane example.The envoys of Antigua and Barbuda are basking intheir glory because of the high ranking the country receivedin the 1998 Human Development Report. The laudationsand accommodations received have been profuse  but thisvery factor puts forward the absurd premise that we aremore developed than Mexico or Brazil. Antigua andBarbuda is deemed to be middle-income  and itsnumerous vulnerabilities are ignored as gross nationalproduct is the sole deciding factor. Our challenge is toconvince the international agencies that we should be onthe priority list for development loans and assistance.Antigua and Barbuda and other Caribbean countries havedemonstrated how developing countries can use theirlimited resources for the advancement of theirpopulations. We should not be penalized for progress.Small island developing States are constantly andcontinually at risk  whether through sea-level rise hurricanes  earthquakes or volcanic eruptions  as has beenthe case with the emerald isle of Montserrat. A singlehurricane can put back our development some 10 years.For ourselves  we have put out a plea for internationalassistance  as for the third time in three years we havebeen afflicted by a hurricane. Until the passage ofhurricane Georges  our country had been advancingbecause of the prudent and experienced management forwhich we are known. We had built a network of superbroads and improved our telecommunications system tourism had re-established itself after the powerfulHurricane Louis of 1995  new buildings including schoolshad been erected  and our economy was on course for 8per cent growth by the end of the year. This  of course duly manifests the absurdity of using gross nationalproduct as a basis for eliminating us from considerationfor concessional loans. At present we have to ask ourfriends and well-wishers for assistance. In that connection a draft resolution is being circulated on United Nationsassistance to Caribbean countries affected by hurricaneGeorges.This year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. My country willcontinue to focus on efforts to ensure that the protectionof human rights is integrated into all activities of theUnited Nations system. We view seriously the manyreports of child abuse worldwide. We are concerned aboutchildren affected by internecine warfare  and the nowrampant tales of child labour  child prostitution and childpornography. Additionally  we will remain vigilant inseeing to the mainstreaming of women’s concerns.Overall  my country will be exercising efforts to see tothe furtherance of endeavours to strengthen human rightsprogrammes.In approaching the twenty-first century  theGovernment of Antigua and Barbuda has decided that itshould focus on human capital and its development  rather12than focusing narrowly on the economic question. Therewill be a continuance of the policy of carrying out intenseinvestigations and feasibility studies to decide on where toconcentrate limited resources. In addition  even though theGovernment is divesting itself of some of its holdings andencouraging greater private investment in vital services andcommodities  there are some areas  particularly thosesurrounding technology  in which the Government has toremain directly involved and catalytic; it will continue itspractice of seeking consensus to determine key industriesand activities that are crucial and critical for development.In concluding  a statement has to be made in regard toour appreciation for the work done in the Caribbean by theUnited Nations Development Programme. Particular thankshave to be expressed for its work in economic managementand governance initiatives. We will continue to be proud ofand to cherish the United Nations  as we recognize itscapacity for achievements in areas beyond the reach ofnational or regional authorities. Subsequently  the nationsthat compose this Assembly must redouble their collectivecommitment to translate vision into reality. That is why itis essential to have international cooperation fordevelopment in the forefront of our activities. The UnitedNations is still our greatest hope for peace  developmentand social justice."
"9",334,"AUS",53,1998,"On behalf of the ForeignMinister of Australia  Mr. Alexander Downer  who isunable to be here because of our national election next23week  I would like to extend warm congratulations to you Sir  on your election as President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-third session. Your country  Uruguay  has givenconsistent and strong support to the United Nations  andyour own expertise and contribution to the development ofinternational law in particular is widely recognized. Weknow that we are in good hands  just as we were last yearwith your predecessor  Hennadiy Udovenko. Like him  youmay count on Australiaâs support as you carry out yourresponsibilities and work to guide us towards constructiveand worthwhile outcomes.As was very clear from the range of issues addressedon the first day and again this morning in the generaldebate  you take up the presidency  Sir  at a time when theagenda before the United Nations is more challenging thanit has ever been. Australia is very concerned about many ofthose challenges and issues. But today I want to focusparticularly on the subject of non-proliferation anddisarmament  where recent events have brought us to acrossroads in our attempts to steer the world away from thethreat of weapons of mass destruction.Although we heard some pessimistic perspectivesyesterday  in Australiaâs view the progress that theinternational community has made in the field of armscontrol and disarmament over recent decades has  in fact been remarkable â€” a trend to which the end of the coldwar lent added impetus. Many bilateral  regional andinternational agreements have been concluded  all makinga contribution to making our world more secure. Thoseachievements were driven by the realization that we mustwork with determination towards a situation where the rightto self-defence of all nations  which is  after all  enshrinedin the United Nations Charter  must be ensured at thelowest possible level of conventional armament and withoutrecourse at all to weapons of mass destruction. Eventswhich have moved against the tide of this progress havebeen relatively rare  but when they have occurred they havestood in stark contrast to the preferred direction of theinternational community.A survey of the progress made to date in the field ofarms control and disarmament points to two keyconclusions. The first is self-evident: there is more work tobe done. The second is perhaps easier to overlook. In theface of periodic setbacks and challenges  it is vitallyimportant  and in the security interests of all countries  thatwe stay the course on arms control and disarmament  thatwe not underestimate or take for granted the value of whathas been achieved to date  and that we maintain the broad-based political commitment to the norms and institutionsthat we have put in place or have yet to build.A stock-take of progress in arms control anddisarmament over recent decades leaves no doubt aboutthe positive direction in which the community is movingin building a global security architecture. In addition toagreements on conventional arms limitation andtransparency measures  the balance sheet for weapons ofmass destruction is particularly impressive.A Treaty banning an entire category of weapons ofmass destruction â€” the Chemical WeaponsConvention â€” was successfully negotiated and hasattracted widespread support  and efforts are under way tostrengthen the Biological Weapons Convention.A milestone Treaty now exists â€” theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) â€”which bans all nuclear-weapon test explosions and allother nuclear explosions.Long called-for by political leaders from across allregions  hard-negotiated in the Conference onDisarmament and finally adopted by the Assembly by anoverwhelming majority two years ago  the CTBT has nowattracted the adherence of over 150 States  and itsinstitutional fabric is being steadily established.The cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferationregime â€” the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) â€” has been extended indefinitely andhas achieved near-universal membership  and agreementhas been reached to commence negotiations to ban theproduction of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons.In another area  under the strategic arms reductionsprocess  or START  and consistent with article VI of theNPT  deep cuts have been made in the cold-war arsenalsof the two largest possessors of nuclear weapons  bringingcloser the day when plurilateral and multilateral phases ofnuclear disarmament can realistically be envisaged.With START I almost fully implemented  the UnitedStates and the Russian Federation  from which we havejust heard  have more than halved their holdings ofstrategic nuclear warheads over the past decade. STARTIII will bring those same arsenals down to some 80 percent below cold-war peaks. It is clearly very important forSTART II to enter into force quickly so that planning forimplementation can begin  ensuring there is nointerruption to the nuclear disarmament process.The international nuclear safeguards systems havealso been strengthened  enhancing international confidencein the integrity of this regime and its ability to detect and24deter non-compliance with non-proliferation obligations.And finally  a treaty banning landmines â€” what some havecalled weapons of mass destruction in slow motion â€” hasbeen concluded.On the other side of the ledger  the non-proliferationand disarmament regimes have had to withstand seriouschallenges from the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Koreaand from Iraq  and the progress towards a universal no-nuclear-testing norm has been seriously jolted by sporadicoutbreaks of testing  most recently by India and Pakistan.Unresolved regional tensions in South Asia and the MiddleEast continue to bedevil and to thwart the attainment of thegoal of universal membership of the NPT. While beingjustifiably dismayed at the disdain of the few for the clearlyexpressed will of the international community  we can alsodraw encouragement from the strength of our national andcollective responses to these challenges and the resilienceof the regimes when so challenged.It is vitally important that we stay the course  that weensure that such events amount to no more than temporarydeviations from the near-universally accepted norm againstthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Webelieve that this is in Australiaâs national interest and in theinterest of international and regional security to uphold thenuclear and other non-proliferation regimes and to continueto do our utmost to pursue effective measures to reduce andeliminate the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction.In a strange way  the periodic setbacks to these effortsserve to underscore the value of the progress made to date.The very existence of the NPT  and its near-universalmembership  highlights the unacceptability of embarkingupon a nuclear-weapon programme in todayâs world.Similarly  it is the very existence of the CTBT  and thenear-universal point of view it represents â€” namely  thatnuclear testing should be a thing of the past â€” thatrendered more powerful the widespread disapproval of thespate of nuclear tests earlier this year. The new ratificationswhich the CTBT attracted following the South Asiannuclear tests were eloquent testimony to the confidence ofthe international community in and its commitment to theno-testing norm.Australia would like to take this public opportunity tocongratulate Brazil and to welcome it as the most recentmember of the family of NPT nations. We call on thathandful of States remaining outside the NPT to reflect onthe possibility that the 187 countries which have decidedthat the NPT provides greater security than the nuclear-weapons option might be right  and that they â€” theoutsiders â€” might be wrong. Australia also calls on themto consider how much more seriously their nationalsecurity interests would be degraded in a world where theoverwhelming majority of States had not embraced thenuclear non-proliferation norm.My country  as I think is well known  has long beena very firm supporter of universal adherence to treaties oninternational weapons of mass destruction. We havesigned all 13 multilateral arms control and disarmamenttreaties and ratified all of these bar one; ratification of theOttawa Convention on landmines  I am happy to say  isin progress. Only four other countries can match thisrecord. We remain committed to making a differencewhere and when we can in building consensus on the wayforward  and we will continue to be as diligent and ascreative as possible across the full range of arms-controland disarmament issues.Our focus  for those who know us well  is always onresults rather than rhetoric and on making pragmaticcontributions where we can  illustrated by the sort ofcontributions that we have made to helping to negotiatethe key Conventions to which I have referred and by oursupport for building and strengthening the institutionswhich work in various ways to support international arms-control and disarmament goals â€” institutions such as theUnited Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)  theKorean Peninsula Energy Development Organization(KEDO)  the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN) Regional Forum and the nuclear safeguardssystem.Experience has shown that these regimes cannot betaken for granted. The existing regimes need continualcare  maintenance and vigilance to ensure that theyremain effective and that political and financialcommitment to them remains strong.In the NPT area  for example  further work is neededto maintain the strength of the Treaty and to go on toachieve its full implementation and universality. The sixthReview Conference  in the year 2000  following on therecent serious challenges to the non-proliferation norm  towhich I have referred  will be one of the most significantin the history of the Treaty. But even if we have adistance to go in terms of the Treatyâs value  surely noone would argue that the world would be a safer placewithout it. Nor could it be argued that the negotiation ofthe Treaty back in the late 1960s  and the maintenanceand strengthening of the Treaty ever since  has not beenworth the effort.25And to those few who persist with the tired refrainthat the NPT is a discriminatory Treaty  we say â€œYes  it isâ€ and for one excellent reason: the NPT allows a temporarystate of discrimination between the nuclear-weapon Statesand the rest of us because  quite simply  the alternative was and still is  too horrible to contemplate. We might lamentthat because of the cold war the state of discriminationlasted far too long  but we surely cannot argue that thealternative scenario would have made the world a saferplace than it is today. For it was a commonplace ofpolitical forecasts in the 1960s  when nuclear weapons werea legitimate security option for any State  that over 20States  including my own  Australia  would likely choose toexercise that option.And it is surely perverse  when the titanic arsenals ofnuclear weapons accumulated during the cold war are atlast being drastically cut  to act against the tide ofdisarmament by pursuing the nuclear option.Similarly  no one could argue that we would be betteroff without a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Itsconclusion  its signature by the five nuclear-weapon Statesand its ratification to date by two are majorachievements â€” all the more reason to press ahead withthe establishment of the Treatyâs implementation andverification structures.A strong start has been made in implementing theChemical Weapons Convention. Its effectiveness is alreadyamply demonstrated  but we need continued political willand financial commitment  as well as the additionalratifications and accessions  for the full security benefits ofthe Convention to be realized.Similarly  the Biological Weapons Convention isweakened by its lack of verification and complianceprovisions. Work is now under way in the Ad Hoc Groupnegotiations to rectify this deficiency. We strongly supportthis Ad Hoc Group and are working together with others toproduce an effective and workable protocol to strengthenthe Biological Weapons Convention.One of the things that we have been doing â€” andpeople may have seen the reference to a meeting about thisin todayâs Journal â€” has been to work collaboratively withmany other countries to convene an informal meeting ofForeign Ministers. This informal meeting is going to beheld tomorrow  here in New York  and it represents thedetermination of many countries  at high political levels  towork together to bring us closer to the goal of an earlyconclusion of an effective protocol to strengthen theBiological Weapons Convention.In conjunction with the international communityâsefforts to achieve full implementation and universality ofexisting regimes  we also need new  reinforcing andcomplementary steps to achieve our overall arms controland disarmament goals.Commencement of negotiations for a fissile materialcut-off treaty is an excellent example of how we shouldbe moving forward in this respect. We see it as the nextlogical step after the CTBT  and it is one to which wehope the Assembly will lend unequivocal support andencouragement. The recent agreement in the Conferenceon Disarmament in Geneva to commence negotiations ona cut-off treaty demonstrates  we believe  the resilience ofthe non-proliferation regime under pressure. It gives thelie to those who recently pronounced it dead. It is a signof the international community reaffirming its faith in thenon-proliferation principle to which it has been committedfor the past 30 years.I want to refer very briefly to three more subjects:United Nations reform  human rights and peacekeeping.Like most other Member States  we want thisOrganization to work better. Some progress has beenmade. We welcomed the agreement reached on keyelements of the Secretary-Generalâs reform package.Indeed  we worked hard and quietly to help bring thisabout. But it is now very important to ensure that whathas been agreed is effectively implemented â€” that thetask force and the reviews of specific aspects of UnitedNations organizations all actually produce concreteoutcomes and that real change does in fact occur.Critical to the achievement of real reform will be theresolution of the ongoing problem of non-payment ofarrears in financial contributions. The failure of manyMember States  including the major contributor  toaddress this situation hinders all our efforts to strengthenthis Organization.Also  much of the reform process to us appears tohave been focused on rationalizing and refining structuresand mechanisms and on administrative measures. Wethink that the next phase of the reform process has to givemuch more structured thought â€” and I believe that thisis what the Secretary-General has in mind in hispresentations to date on the Millennium Assembly â€” tothe kind of United Nations we expect and want in thedecades to come. A thorough review of priorities isoverdue. Although the lofty ideals enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter remain as valid as ever  we need to giveserious thought to modernizing the ways in which we26give effect to those objectives in terms of operationalactivities.Australia is concerned  like so many others who havespoken in the general debate to date  that the debate onSecurity Council reform has stalled. We have had anexhaustive â€” but  regrettably  inconclusive â€” discussionover the last year. It is time now to move beyond generaldiscussion to serious negotiation of a reform package  onewhich will usher in a remodelled Council that is morerepresentative  transparent and suited to the newmillennium. This will require serious engagement andflexibility from all involved. My Government remainscommitted to finding ways to move the debate forward.Those of you who were here at last yearâs session ofthe General Assembly may recall that Foreign MinisterDowner raised the issue of electoral groups. We continueto assert that this is an important element in the reformdebate. It is over 30 years since the last significant changewas made to the regional groups. The drawbacks of thepresent configuration are becoming more and more obvious:substantial disparities in the size of the various groups andan inadequate level of representation available to manysubregions  including Australiaâs own geographical area ofEast Asia and the Pacific. We have noted that there isgathering interest among Member States in this subject  andwe think it is time that we recognized it as an element ofreform which needs to be addressed. Changing the groupsto reflect better contemporary realities and the interests ofthe current membership will  we recognize  require carefulthought and patient discussion  and it is simply far too earlyto put forward any particular formula. But we suggest wecould begin by discussing the principles on which a newsystem could be built and by exchanging views in athoughtful and non-acrimonious way on how we might takethe process forward.The year 1998 marks the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and also 50 yearsof United Nations peacekeeping. Australiaâs commitment toupholding the fundamental human rights enshrined in theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights remains as strongnow as it was in 1948  when the Declaration wasproclaimed. Members may not know that Australia was oneof the eight countries tasked with the drafting of theDeclaration and that we also played an important role inensuring that human rights provisions were included in theUnited Nations Charter. Fifty years ago  the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights represented a commonstatement of goals and aspirations  a vision of the world asthe international community would want it to become.We still believe in that vision and we see the fiftiethanniversary as a time for the international community toreaffirm its commitment to this powerful document.Similarly  the 50 years of United Nations peacekeepinggives us an opportunity to recognize how far theinstitution of peacekeeping has come  to take stock of thelessons we have learnt from the past and  perhaps mostimportantly  to pay tribute to over 1 500 peacekeeperswho have made the ultimate sacrifice for a safer andmore peaceful world.Whether we are talking of old problems or newones  whether we are analysing setbacks or successes  ormarking anniversaries  the annual stocktake which thisgeneral debate represents offers the opportunity not for aseries of set speeches unrelated to each other and tickingoff a lot of subjects  but rather a chance to remindourselves of what the United Nations stands for  torecognize what has been achieved to date  and torecommit ourselves for the future to protecting andadvancing those achievements.I have focused today on disarmament not only as anarea of the utmost priority for Australia and Australians but also as one where we believe we can add value. Butthe parallels and lessons of disarmament and non-proliferation hold good for other areas of the UnitedNations activities.I said at the very outset that the internationalcommunity was at a crossroads in our attempts to buildan international dispensation in which the threat of massdestruction had no place. The achievements of the last 30years in setting in place treaties  institutions and norms toensure that we move in that direction are impressive. Butthey are not invulnerable. Inadequate verification  non-compliance  aberrant behaviour  budget fatigue  reformfatigue failure of political will â€” all of these things havethe potential to unravel and to undermine what we havebuilt together. Effective arms control  disarmament andnon-proliferation â€” like all the other subjects that arebeing addressed from this rostrum â€” require largeinvestments of political and economic capital. It might benatural at times  particularly challenging and worryingtimes such as we are currently experiencing  to wonder ifit is worth the cost. Brief consideration of the alternativesis surely enough to convince us that the answer isundoubtedly â€œyesâ€.To do otherwise would be to betray not only theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights which we arecommemorating  but also the very principles of theUnited Nations Charter."
"10",381,"AUT",53,1998,"I have the honour andprivilege to speak on behalf of the European Union. Inthis capacity I would like to extend my warm and sincerecongratulations to you  Sir  on your election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We arepleased that a distinguished Latin American statesmanchairs our deliberations. I am confident that yourexperience  talent and energy will ensure a successfuloutcome for the work of our session.I wish to express the high appreciation of theEuropean Union for the outstanding leadership of theSecretary-General  Kofi Annan  and for his excellent workat the helm of the United Nations. His â€œquiet revolutionâ€of institutional reforms has our full support. We arelooking forward to working with him to prepare theMillennium Assembly in the year 2000 in order to meetthe challenges of human solidarity.At the turn of the century  we live in a fascinatingand challenging  but also difficult and complex  period oftime  characterized by uncertainty and unpredictability.Local wars and ethnic conflicts have continued and newones have broken out. â€œPeace processesâ€ have had rathermixed success  and some show a distressing tendency tounravel. The threat from weapons of mass destruction isas alarming as ever. A majority of the Earthâs populationstill lives in poverty. Enormous environmental disastershit our planet all too often  and organized crime  illicitdrug trafficking and terrorism are the plague of our time.Financial and economic crises of unprecedenteddimensions do not spare any region â€” Asia and Russiabeing the most recent examples.The impact of these phenomena is felt directly andimmediately by every citizen in the world. Economies aremore intertwined than ever  and information travelsaround the globe within seconds. No one can escape theforces of globalization  but all of us can join not only inconfronting transnational threats but also in collecting thefruits of globalization. The United Nations has a key partto play in this collective effort. Only our universalorganization has the scope and legitimacy to generate theprinciples  norms and rules that are essential to harnessthe potential of globalization while managing its negativeeffects.7Todayâs turmoil in the financial markets can be dealtwith only at a global level  addressing the political causesas well as the financial and economic aspects. It isimperative that industrial and developing countries elaboratea common strategy in a framework of international financialcooperation  including the G-22  and formulate standardsand rules for financial transactions. What is needed now isleadership. Short-term remedies are not enough; long-termforward looking policies are required. We must invest inboth sustainable growth and solidarity. As serious as thecrisis is  there is every reason not to panic. The worldeconomy is basically sound  with two thirds â€” 70 percent â€” of the worldâs population living in growth zones.We sometimes forget that.The European model of social market economy hasserved well to harness the forces of globalization.Respecting the interests and wishes of the people  showingsolidarity for the poor and disadvantaged  promoting socialpartnership between employers and employees andcombating unemployment by creating jobs and so on areintrinsic elements of a social market economy. We believethat this European model of a social market economydeserves serious consideration in our turbulent and complexage. To be honest  this is a kind of third way some arelooking for.Europeâs answer to the challenges of globalization istwo millennium projects which will shape the face of ourcontinent: the introduction of the euro and the enlargementof the Union.The single currency will improve the functioning ofthe internal market  help to secure employment and provideincentives for the market-oriented structural reforms neededto safeguard Europeâs competitiveness. The creation of theeuro has the potential to stabilize the international economicenvironment and to promote international trade. From theperspective of the world economy  this will be the mostimportant effect of the single currency. Markets havealready anticipated the introduction of the euro  as borneout by the monetary stability of the participating currencies at a time when other countries and regions are experiencingsevere financial crises. Consequently  the euro is creating azone of stability and prosperity which will benefit the entireworld economy.The second millennium project  which has far-reachingconsequences  is the enlargement of the European Union.We are convinced that the integration of our neighbours isthe best way to safeguard lasting political stability andeconomic progress in Europe. Successful enlargement willbring a new dynamic to the Union and strengthen its roleto the benefit of all the citizens of both Europe and theworld. The process of enlarging the Union does not meanthat the Union will become more inward-oriented orEurocentric. On the contrary  we are convinced that theUnion must continue to be outward- and forward-looking.Enlarging the European Union will go hand-in-hand withdeveloping our traditional relations with countries andexporting stability around the world.As President of the Council of the European Union I would like to assure Members of the United Nationsthat an enlarged Union with a strong common currencywill be a reliable and strong partner for the UnitedNations and the world.I would like to stress the paramount interest of theEuropean Union in the political and economic stability ofRussia. We hope that the new Government of Russia willbe able to re-establish confidence among the Russianpeople and the international financial community. Westand ready to cooperate further with the Russianauthorities in support of sustained efforts towardsstabilization and reform.Let me now draw attention to a subject to which Iattach the highest priority: the protection of the mostvulnerable group in societies  our children. I am deeplyconvinced that a far-sighted policy  both internal andexternal  should be geared to the well-being of futuregenerations. We  the statesmen  diplomats and decisionmakers of 185 nations  meeting in this Assembly  bear anenormous responsibility to formulate future-orientedpolicies in the service of young citizens on our planet.These include a fundamental principle. Our children mustlive childhood in peace  freedom  prosperity and security free of abuse  violence and exploitation.Millions of children and juveniles are exploitedworldwide  their basic human rights denied in many ways.A global coalition must be forged to fight the abuse ofchildren  in particular sexual exploitation  the despicablephenomenon of child soldiers and child labour.The European Union supports the InternationalLabour Organization draft convention on child labour.The involvement of children in armed conflict and itsdisastrous consequences require particular attention andaction by the international community. I call upon allStates and parties to conflicts to respect existinginternational standards  to stop the use of children ascombatants and to fully support the work of theSecretary-Generalâs Special Representative for Childrenin Armed Conflict  Olara Otunnu.8Sexual exploitation of children is one of the mostabhorrent phenomena of our time. The European Unionputs special emphasis on combating child prostitution andchild pornography. This includes the spread of childpornography on the Internet. New information technologiescreate new challenges. But that is why  more than ever  wehave to prohibit the production  dissemination andpossession of child pornography in all its forms â€” print audio  electronic media and video. Many countries havealready enacted such legislation nationally. But only aworldwide ban on child pornography will be effective. Inthis context  we hope that the optional protocol on the saleof children  child prostitution and child pornography can befinalized in the near future.Legislative action has to be complemented byimproved cooperation between national and internationallaw enforcement and judicial authorities. I appeal toGovernments  the United Nations  non-governmentalorganizations and private business â€” including onlineservices and Internet service providers â€” to join efforts ina crusade against child abuse. For every day we fail to doso  the innocent children of our world pay a terrible price.Human rights  good and democratic governance andthe rule of law have moved to centre stage in promotingpeace  security and sustainable development. Respect forand promotion of human rights have become a crucialcomponent of Union policies. They play a significant rolein contractual relations with third countries  in developmentcooperation and in the common foreign and security policy.The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights and the five-year implementation reviewof the Vienna Declaration should provide an opportunity fora critical assessment of the progress made by all States.The Council of the European Union  in commemorating thisanniversary on 10 December this year in Vienna  will senda strong signal to further strengthen the United Nationshuman rights programme  in particular the Office of theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.The European Union will continue to work towardsthe full integration of human rights  as well as a genderperspective  into all activities of the United Nations system.We hope that the adoption of the human rights defendersdeclaration will send a strong message of support to humanrights activists worldwide. The European Union welcomesthe progress on a draft protocol to the Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and a draft protocol to the Convention against Torture. Wehope that the respective Working Groups can complete theirwork next year.I would like to stress our strong interest incooperating with other Governments and civil society toimprove the human rights situation in all parts of theworld. To this end  the Union supports a wide range ofprojects and programmes in the field of human rights  therule of law and electoral assistance. We will also workfor the complete abolition of the death penalty. In themeantime  we shall call for a moratorium on allexecutions worldwide.The international community is confronted with anincreasing number of new and more diverse forms ofconflict  which often turn violent. Apart from takingmeasures of operational prevention  which address theconsequences of conflicts and range from preventivediplomacy to all forms of peaceful settlement of disputesand the preventive deployment of forces  we have toconcentrate on the root causes  such as disrespect forminorities. We therefore need a pro-active policy focusing on preventing the outbreak of violence at anearly stage.Early warning is a key element of a comprehensivestrategy of conflict prevention and a prerequisite for anyfurther action. Finally  post-conflict rehabilitation has tobe more comprehensive and coordinated to address thewider issues of humanitarian assistance  reconstructionand respect for human rights  democracy and the rule oflaw. The European Union firmly supports United Nationsefforts to strengthen its conflict-prevention and crisis-management capacity.We are deeply committed to the primary role of theUnited Nations in the maintenance of international peaceand security and to the core functions of United Nationspeacekeeping operations. This strong support is reflectedin the facts: 4 500 troops and policemen from EuropeanUnion countries serve in United Nations peacekeepingoperations  which is one third of United Nationspeacekeeping personnel; thousands more men and womenfrom the European Union have served and are serving inUnited Nations-mandated operations such as theStabilization Force in Bosnia; and our financialcontribution represents almost 40 per cent of the UnitedNations peacekeeping budget.We welcome the increasingly multidimensionalnature of peacekeeping operations  which poses newchallenges to the average peacekeeper in the field.Peacekeeping today encompasses not only military tasksbut a variety of other functions  such as civilian policeactivities  humanitarian assistance  demining  disarmamentmeasures  demobilization  reintegration of former soldiers 9enhancing and monitoring respect for human rights and  lastbut not least  public information. At United NationsHeadquarters  this requires a strong Department ofPeacekeeping Operations which is able to fulfil its functionseffectively. In the wake of the decision by the GeneralAssembly to reduce progressively the number of posts filledby personnel on loan  we strongly underline that theDepartmentâs expertise and gains of recent years must beretained.The European Union is gravely concerned about theincreasing security threat to United Nations personnel in thefield  not least to unarmed military observers and civilianpersonnel. Bearing in mind the responsibility of the UnitedNations and Member States towards those participating inUnited Nations peacekeeping operations  we wish to recallthe obligation of host countries and parties to conflicts toensure the safety of these operations.I would like to express our admiration and gratitude toall the men and women who serve under the banner of theUnited Nations in peace operations around the globe. Theyshow remarkable courage  motivation and idealism.Likewise  I wish to express my deep sympathy to thefamilies of United Nations personnel who have lost theirlives in the service of peace.The European Union attaches the utmost importanceto progress in the areas of disarmament  arms control andnon-proliferation as a key element in the maintenance ofpeace and the strengthening of security. In this respect  theUnion wishes to reiterate its deep concern about the gravethreat to international peace and security posed by thenuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan in May thisyear. The Union has called on both countries to adhere tointernational non-proliferation regimes  in particular bysigning the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as itstands. The Union strongly urges India and Pakistan torefrain from nuclear tests and from the development ordeployment of nuclear weapons and nuclear-capablemissiles. Likewise  we call on both countries to engage ina substantive dialogue with each other and to agree onconfidence-building measures.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons is the cornerstone of the global non-proliferationregime and the essential foundation for the pursuit ofnuclear disarmament. We are committed to the early entryinto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyand welcome the recent ratifications by several countries.We call upon all States which have not yet done so toaccede to it  without any change. The conclusion of a fissilematerial cut-off treaty will constitute a significantcontribution to non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.We warmly welcome the fact that all impediments tostarting such negotiations finally have been overcome  andwe are looking forward to contributing to the substantivenegotiations. We continue to believe that the systematicand progressive efforts by nuclear-weapon States toreduce nuclear weapons need to be intensified andpursued with determination.Biological weapons pose grave dangers. It isshocking that they can also be produced by non-Stateactors. Therefore  the European Union gives priority tostrengthening the Biological and Toxin WeaponsConvention. We strive for the successful conclusion ofthe negotiations on a legally binding protocol establishinga verification and compliance regime in 1999. I wouldalso like to underline our commitment to the universalityand the full and effective implementation of the ChemicalWeapons Convention  a landmark in the disarmamentprocess.The European Union reaffirms its commitment to thegoal of totally eliminating anti-personnel landminesworldwide and welcomes the opening for signature of theOttawa Convention. We are pleased that the number ofsignatories and ratifications is rising steadily and that theConvention will enter into force on 1 March 1999. Thefact that the required number of 40 ratifications wasreached so quickly underlines the importance that theinternational community attaches to this endeavour. TheEuropean Union  being the major donor to anti-mineactivities  is contributing significantly to solving theproblems caused by those weapons.A serious challenge to the international communityis raised by the combination of internal conflicts and theproliferation of small arms. This issue requires a multi-pronged response. The Union  for its part  has adopted acode of conduct on arms exports and has thereby set highcommon standards. Moreover  we are currently engagedin the implementation of the European Union programmefor preventing and combating illicit trafficking inconventional arms. Under this programme  we will assistthird countries in preventing and combating illicittrafficking in arms  and we will also assist affectedcountries.As we approach the new millennium  nearly aquarter of the worldâs people â€” foremost among themwomen and children â€” continue to live in absolutepoverty  while almost a third more are very poor. Whilethe blight of poverty thus continues to challenge theinternational community  recent decades have also shown10that progress in the reduction of poverty is possible. Thegoal of poverty eradication  through sustained growth andeconomic and social development  must be placed at thecentre of international development cooperation.Poverty has many dimensions and needs to be tackledin a gender-sensitive and comprehensive way within thecontext of sustainable development  based on theinterdependence and mutually reinforcing nature ofeconomic development  social development andenvironmental protection. The European Union thereforeattaches great importance to an integrated and coordinatedfollow-up to global conferences. While the firstresponsibility lies with Governments  the United Nationssystem  as the global framework for internationalcooperation  has a key role to play in supporting andcoordinating national efforts.A new global partnership between developingcountries  developed countries  multilateral institutions andcivil society  with emphasis put on local ownership andcomplementarity of efforts  must be forged in order toachieve people-centred sustainable development. The strongcommitment of the Union to such a global partnership isbased on its unique position as the worldâs largest providerof development assistance.Among the various frameworks  the present LomÃ©Convention  which will expire in February 2000  remainsessential. During the upcoming negotiations on a successor the European Union will aim at strengthening itspartnership with the countries of Africa  the Caribbean andthe Pacific. Building on the experience gained so far  theaim is to develop a modern and efficient framework forcooperation in order to keep the relationship between theUnion and the African  Caribbean and Pacific countriesstrong and prominent in the twenty-first century. I amconvinced that cooperation in the context of the LomÃ©Convention will make an effective contribution toeradicating poverty and integrating the African  Caribbeanand Pacific countries into our worldwide economic system.We are committed to sustainable development as theoverarching principle of national policy and internationalcooperation in our policies. Recognizing the central role ofa healthy environment in quality of life  the EuropeanUnion attaches great importance to reform of the UnitedNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UnitedNations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT). Wewould welcome more coordination  focus and efficiency inthese areas. The Kyoto Protocol  in which the memberStates of the European Union committed themselves to areduction of 8 per cent in greenhouse gases  constitutes animportant step towards sustainable development. Asdeveloped countries  we are prepared to take the lead incombating climate change. The European Community andits member States are determined to translate thecommitments made at Kyoto into concrete actions andachievements.In the context of sustainable development  populationissues are of particular concern. They directly relate tohuman health and the quality of life. Over the comingdecades  population size and age structure will beimportant factors interacting with economic developmentand the environment in all parts of the world. It istherefore very timely that a special session of the GeneralAssembly will be convened next year to review andappraise the implementation of the Programme of Actionof the International Conference on Population andDevelopment  held in Cairo in 1994.The fight against drugs is a major priority in thepolicy of the European Union. The recent special sessionof the General Assembly on the world drug problem wasan important step in the international effort to counter theglobal scourge of drug abuse. I should like to pay tributeto the Executive Director of the United Nations DrugControl Programme (UNDCP)  Pino Arlacchi  and allothers involved  for the excellent preparation of thesession. Political leaders unanimously endorsed a series ofimportant documents  including a Political Declaration several action plans  time-frames and a number ofconcrete measures.We welcome the balanced  integrated and gender-sensitive anti-drug strategy adopted by the special session.Our new commitments embrace efforts on both the supplyand the demand side  constituting equal parameters of thedrug-control equation. In particular  we look forward tothe elaboration of an operational action programme ondemand reduction. We from the European Union fullysupport an effective and rapid follow-up andimplementation programme of the outcome of the specialsession.In the light of the important new and extensivemandates in the field of international drug control  thedonor base of UNDCP must be broadened. The EuropeanUnion will continue to support the valuable work ofUNDCP  the international lead agency in the follow-up tothe special session.The fight against organized crime â€” and the workof the United Nations Centre for International CrimePrevention â€” is of foremost importance. In this context11we welcome closer cooperation between UNDCP and theCrime Prevention Centre in order to enhance the synergy ofthese programmes. The danger which transnationalorganized crime poses to the world community by creepinginto many aspects of our societies must be met by effectiveinternational measures. Therefore  we support theelaboration of a convention against transnational organizedcrime and are pleased about the constructive and productivespirit of the preparatory meeting in Buenos Aires.The horrible bomb attacks in Africa and NorthernIreland have brought terrorism back to the forefront ofinternational concern. The General Assembly  setting normsand standards for the fight against terrorism  has passed anumber of resolutions and adopted no fewer than 11 anti-terrorism conventions. The Sixth Committee is currentlynegotiating a convention on the suppression of acts ofnuclear terrorism. Its early finalization would signal thedetermination of the international community to relentlesslypursue terrorists. Only through concerted action can we winthe battle against terrorists. The more countries join in thiseffort  the fewer the safe havens where terrorists can run orhide.The successful completion of the Conference for theestablishment of an International Criminal Court is anachievement of historic dimensions. The European Unionfully endorses the outcome of the Rome Conference and theStatute  which was adopted by an overwhelming majorityof participating States. This Statute lays the foundation foran effective and credible Court as an institution to fightimpunity for the most heinous crimes and to deter  onceand for all  their commission  thereby contributing to theglobal advancement of peace and democracy. This sessionof the General Assembly must adopt the appropriatedecisions to make the Court a reality. The European Unionstands ready to do its utmost to contribute to theaccomplishment of these tasks.As in the past  the European Union describes itsrelations with third countries  and its position on areas ofconflict throughout the world  in a memorandum that iscirculated as an integral part of this address. Thememorandum is a useful compendium of the commonforeign and security policy of the Union and of relevantCommunity policies. I will highlight just a few positions.We are extremely concerned at the dramatic escalationof tension in Kosovo. Hundreds of people have been killed more than 250 000 refugees have been forced to leave theirhomes as a result of armed clashes  and the threat of ahumanitarian catastrophe is becoming ever more real. Theprimary responsibility for the devastating situation restswith the Serb and Yugoslav authorities  since their policeand military operations have led to consequences for thecivilian population that are out of any justifiableproportion. Therefore  it is up to President SlobodanMilosevic to order a halt to all repressive actions againstthe civilian population in Kosovo. At the same time  theUnion expects that all parties concerned reject all formsof violence.The Union  together with humanitarian organizations has started a series of projects in order to createfavourable conditions for a return process for refugeesbefore the winter comes. A complete cessation of armedactivities and a progressive withdrawal of Serb forces isneeded now to make people confident enough to return totheir homes. The European Union urges the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia authorities to allow unimpededaccess to all areas of Kosovo for humanitarianorganizations and observers and international forensicexperts.Negotiations between both sides  with internationalinvolvement  should take place as soon as possible toagree upon confidence-building measures and to define anew status for Kosovo. However  without a cessation ofthe ongoing Serb offensive  an end to further bloodshedand a significant improvement of the catastrophichumanitarian situation  a meaningful dialogue cannot bestarted. The European Union hopes that progress towardsdemocracy  which is a prerequisite for the resolution ofthe conflict  can be achieved in the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia. The final objective of the reform processshould be the full integration of the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia into the international community.The Union remains fully committed to theimplementation of the Dayton Accords  to political andeconomic stabilization  the return of refugees and thestrengthening of civil society in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The past year has seen substantial progress due to strongpressure by the international community. We hope thatthe recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina willcontribute to the reconciliation of the ethnic communitiesand to the construction of a new civil society.With regard to Albania  the European Union isseriously concerned at the recent outbreak of violencefollowing the assassination of a leading politician of anopposition party. The European Union calls on allAlbanian political parties to adopt a constructive attitudeto solving the crisis by peaceful means through politicalconsultations. It urges the parties to renounce any strategyof confrontation and to avoid fighting and violent12demonstrations. Further violence will make nationalreconciliation even more difficult.We sincerely hope that the instability still widespreadin Albania will soon be overcome  in particular byovercoming the current political difficulties caused byhatred  mutual mistrust and various actions by both theGovernment and the main opposition party. The Unionreminds all political factions of their obligation not todeepen the political divide  but rather to develop a spirit ofcooperation.The Union will continue its assistance according toprogress made in the political dialogue as well as in thestabilization of institutions  especially in the field of policeaction.The European Union stresses once again that the statusquo in Cyprus is not acceptable. It reaffirms its strongsupport for the efforts of the Secretary-General and hisSpecial Representative aimed at a negotiated and lastingsolution to the Cyprus question  respecting the sovereignty independence  territorial integrity and unity of the countryin accordance with the relevant Security Councilresolutions  with the goal of a bizonal  bicommunalfederation on Cyprus.The Union started accession negotiations with theRepublic of Cyprus on 31 March of this year. Theaccession process and progress towards a political solutionshould reinforce one another. Accession to the Unionshould benefit all communities and help to bring aboutpeace and reconciliation on the island.In this context  we welcome the appointment of thenew United Nations Deputy Special Representative  DameAnn Hercus.The European Union remains deeply concerned at thecontinuing standstill in the Middle East peace process which constitutes a threat to the stability of the region. TheUnion considers the Middle East peace process to be theonly path to security and peace for Israel  the Palestiniansand the neighbouring States. A just and durable solution isin the fundamental interest of the European Union.Our approach was reaffirmed at the meeting of theEuropean Council held in Cardiff in June 1998. Wecontribute actively to efforts to promote the peace process providing not only substantial economic support but alsoadding our political weight to the search for a solution. Itis of the utmost importance to restore trust and confidencebetween the parties. The pillars of a solution continue to bein the principles agreed at Madrid and Oslo  especiallyland for peace  the full implementation of existingcommitments of the Israeli/Palestinian Interim Agreementand the relevant Security Council resolutions.We call on Israel to recognize the right of thePalestinians to self-determination without excluding theoption of a state of their own. On the other side  we callupon the Palestinians to reaffirm their commitment toIsraelâs right to live within recognized and safe borders.We also reiterate our opposition to Israeli settlements inoccupied Arab territories and to other unilateral measures such as the changing of the status of Jerusalem. Morethan any other issues  such acts  as well as the continuedexpansion of settlements  undermine the Palestiniansâconfidence in the peace process.The European Union will continue to provideassistance to the Palestinian people. The positivedevelopment of the Palestinian economy is a preconditionfor political stability.We want to express our concern at the lack ofprogress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks  and weunderline the need for a continuing effort in order toachieve a solution.The Union supports the efforts of the United Statesto relaunch the negotiations. We consider that everyavenue should be explored in order to restore a spirit ofmutual trust and constructive negotiations. In this respect we think that the recent proposals put forward by Franceand Egypt  as well as by our European Union SpecialEnvoy  should be studied positively.Africa  in particular sub-Saharan Africa  stands at thecrossroads once more. In his landmark report (A/52/871)entitled â€œThe causes of conflict and the promotion ofdurable peace and sustainable development in Africaâ€ Secretary-General Kofi Annan provided us with a clearanalysis and a framework for a comprehensive policy.The European Union is deeply concerned about theterrible toll that recent and current conflicts have taken especially on innocent civilians. In spite of importantregional and subregional efforts  the instability appears tobe spreading  and creating a downward spiral that simplyhas to be stopped. I therefore urge the internationalcommunity to continue to complement African efforts tosolve their problems  as it has done by establishing theUnited Nations Mission in the Central African Republic(MINURCA) and the United Nations Observer Mission inSierra Leone (UNOMSIL). The Union would welcomefurther development of regional and subregional13cooperation and integration among African countries. Wehope that the summit between the European Union and theSouthern African Development Community in Vienna inNovember will make an important contribution.The Secretary-Generalâs report rightly focuses on theimportance of creating an environment in which durablepeace is sustained and economic growth promoted.Recognizing that peace and security are indispensablepreconditions  we emphasize the need for good governance including respect for human rights and the rule of law.These values are essential pillars of the European Unionâsdevelopment policy  which over several decades has beencentred on a genuine partnership with Africa.The European Union is particularly concerned aboutthe ongoing crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congoand the wider dangers for the region as a whole from theescalation of the conflict. In this respect  we hope that theEuropean Union Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region Mr. Aldo Ajello  will continue to work together with therepresentatives of the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations.We urge all the parties involved in the conflict of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo to respect human rightsand humanitarian law and to abstain from acts of violenceagainst civilians. We welcome African initiatives to find apeaceful solution to this conflict  which can be solved onlythrough a negotiated settlement acceptable to all Congolese.This would allow the Democratic Republic of the Congoand other countries of the region to find the peace andstability that are prerequisites for their development. TheUnion remains ready to help this political dialogue and tosupport any negotiation scheme obtaining the consent of allparties involved  inter alia  through the assistance of ourSpecial Envoy for the Great Lakes region. A regionalconference could be useful at a later stage to consider therelevant aspects and to strengthen regional cooperation.We are determined to play an effective role in effortsto stop the fighting and restore peace  stability and respectfor human rights in Afghanistan. We are committed tobringing about a sustainable peace in Afghanistan  puttingan end to foreign intervention  and encouraging intra-Afghan dialogue  in particular through support for thecentral role of the United Nations. The European Unionattaches special importance to the fight against illegal drugsand terrorism in Afghanistan.We remain gravely concerned at the persistent humanrights violations and breaches of humanitarian law inAfghanistan. We denounce the continuing discriminationagainst girls and women in that country. We strongly urgeall factions  and in particular the Taliban  to recognize protect and promote human rights. And we strongly urgethem to end discriminatory policies and to recognize protect and promote equal rights and dignity for men andwomen.Non-governmental organizations will be able toreturn to Kabul only when the authorities in Afghanistanhave met the necessary conditions.We reiterate our strong concern for the security ofUnited Nations personnel  other related personnel andpersonnel of non-governmental organizations inAfghanistan  and we recall the responsibility of allfactions to ensure safety  security and freedom ofmovement. We condemn the recent attack against twostaff members of the United Nations Special Mission toAfghanistan (UNSMA) and the killing of Iraniandiplomats in northern Afghanistan  and we demand anurgent investigation into these atrocious acts. We call onthe Taliban to cooperate fully in ensuring the safe releaseof the remaining diplomats and other Iranian nationalsmissing in Afghanistan.We have been deeply involved in the electoralprocess in Cambodia  especially in voter registration andpoll observation  dispatching some 200 election observerswho cooperated exceptionally well with the UnitedNations and other observer groups in the JointInternational Observer Group.We call upon all political forces in Cambodia toseize this opportunity to work together  to the fullestextent possible  towards national reconciliation  andexpress the hope that  with the elections  the foundationfor the future well-being and prosperity of the people ofCambodia has been laid. Return to political normalcy willencourage the Union to consider new assistanceprogrammes to help Cambodia in its economic recovery.The Union notes with satisfaction the resultsachieved at the August meeting in New York  under theauspices of Mr. Kofi Annan  between the ForeignMinisters of Indonesia and Portugal on the question ofEast Timor. We commend the Secretary-General and hisPersonal Representative for their efforts in this regard.We welcome the Ministersâ agreement to enter intoin-depth negotiations on issues related to the question ofEast Timor  addressed in the final communiquÃ© of themeeting  without prejudice to their basic positions ofprinciple. We hope that these negotiations will lead to a14just  comprehensive and internationally acceptable solutionin the near future  respecting the rights and legitimateaspirations of the people  in accordance with the resolutionsof the General Assembly and with the principles enshrinedin the United Nations Charter. We welcome the prospect ofthe closer involvement of the East Timorese in the searchfor a solution.I am deeply concerned at the continuing violations ofhuman rights and lack of progress towards democracy inBurma/Myanmar. We strongly deplore the repressiveactions of the Burmese authorities  including the arrest ofseveral hundred members of the opposition. We call uponthe State Peace and Development Council once again tobring human rights violations to an end and to enter into asubstantive dialogue with opposition leaders  especially andincluding Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives ofethnic minorities  in order to establish democratic rule inaccordance with the will of the people as expressed indemocratic elections held in 1990. The Union seeks tocooperate closely with other countries  in particular in theregion  to resolve the worrying situation in the country.Although the challenges of the twenty-first centurywill be different from those we have been used to dealingwith in past decades  we are convinced that the UnitedNations will become more indispensable than ever as theforum for global cooperation. What we have to do now isto make our world Organization fit for the next century.The Secretary-Generalâs reform programme is excellent.The reform of our world Organization is in the interestof all Member States. Of course  reform is not a cost-cutting exercise alone  but an ongoing process which willultimately lead to a substantial improvement of the workdone in the United Nations family. This process will helpthe Organization to better focus on the fulfilment ofmandates and on the improvement of programme delivery.Consequently  the European Union will continue vigorouslyto support reform based on the proposals of the Secretary-General and the decisions of the General Assembly.As far as the organization and methods of work ofintergovernmental bodies are concerned  and especially ofthe General Assembly  we attach particular importance tothe implementation of the reforms already agreed upon. Wewould welcome further improvements  particularly thestreamlining of agendas  the reduction of duplication andbetter coordination between bodies dealing with similarissues.The European Union firmly believes that the GeneralAssembly should concentrate on implementing thesignificant agreements reached in some working groups ofthe General Assembly and at the major United Nationsconferences. Carefully wrought compromises that allowedadoption by consensus were the result of a great amountof time and energy invested by all Member States.The European Union is firmly committed to findingsolutions to the United Nations financial crisis.Continuing high levels of unpaid assessments areundermining the financial stability and liquidity  andtherefore the purpose and goal  of the United Nations.This places a heavy and unfair burden upon troop-contributing countries. The member States of theEuropean Union have consistently honoured theirfinancial obligations towards the United Nations. Theypay their contributions in full  on time and withoutconditions. A sound financial basis requires that allMember States fulfil their Charter obligations. The UnitedStates cannot be exempt from such obligations.As a permanent member of the Security Council  theUnited States has a special responsibility towards theUnited Nations. We express our sincere hope thatWashington will soon settle its arrears and live up to thelegitimate expectations of Member States of the UnitedStatesâ role in the world Organization.The European Union has grown from 100 millionpeople to 400 million today. With only 8 per cent of theworld population  the Union provides for 60 per cent ofdevelopment and 50 per cent of humanitarian assistance.Eighty per cent of international aid to Russia and therepublics of the former Soviet Union  and 50 per cent ofthe assistance to the Palestinian territories are paid by theEuropean Union. Forty per cent of the reconstruction helpto Bosnia and Herzegovina come from the member Statesof the European Union. We are the strongest supporter ofthe United Nations. Our contributions account for 36 percent of the regular budget and 39 per cent of thepeacekeeping budget. The Union is ready to use itspolitical weight for the benefit of the entire internationalcommunity  in particular developing countries.Let me conclude by reaffirming the EuropeanUnionâs deep commitment to the purposes and principlesof the United Nations Charter. We will continue tosupport strongly the United Nations and the Secretary-General in carrying out the key objectives: themaintenance of international peace and security  economicand social progress  and the promotion of human rightsand democratic freedoms.15The message of the European Union to the UnitedNations is clear. At the threshold of the new millennium we face common threats and challenges. We must joinforces to harness the benefits and diminish the risks ofglobalization. We must form a global alliance for humansecurity. Global cooperation  as understood by the EuropeanUnion  means human solidarity to ensure the survival of ourplanet and safeguard the future of coming generations."
"11",406,"AZE",53,1998,"Allow me first of all to sincerely congratulatethe President on his unanimous election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session  and toexpress confidence that under his efficient leadership theAssembly will cope successfully with the complex issuesbefore it.I would like to express our special gratitude toMr. Hennadiy Udovenko  whose vast experience and greatprofessionalism greatly contributed to the success of theprevious session  and whose work as President during thefifty-second session epitomized the United Nationscommitment to the process of transformation aimed atenhancing the effectiveness of the Organization.All aspects of life in Azerbaijan are covered by theprocess of radical reform directed at creating ademocratic  secular society governed by the rule of lawand based on a market economy. In spite of the currentobjective difficulties caused by the consequences ofarmed conflict and the problems inherent in thetransitional period  Azerbaijan does not see any alternativeto the course of democratic transformation it has taken and considers the strengthening of its democraticinstitutions a priority of its State policy.Respect for fundamental political and civil rights andfreedoms  the functioning of the multi-party system  theprotection of the interests of each citizen in our societyirrespective of ethnic origin  independence of thejudiciary  as well as the advancement of other elements ofdemocratic society  are guaranteed by the Constitution ofthe Republic of Azerbaijan  which was adopted on 1213November 1995 in a national referendum. A great deal hasbeen done to bring the legislative system of the country inline with relevant international standards.Presidential elections that are to take place inAzerbaijan on 11 October this year will constitute amilestone in the process of further strengthening thedemocratic foundation of the society. Actions alreadyundertaken by the leadership of the country have laid thefoundation for genuinely free and just elections. A new lawon presidential elections in the Republic of Azerbaijan wasthoroughly examined by the Office for DemocraticInstitutions and Human Rights of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and theCouncil of Europe and meets the most rigorousinternational standards in this field.The election process will be observed by 300international monitors from the OSCE  the Council ofEurope and other international organizations  as well asfrom institutions of individual countries  such as theNational Democratic Institute for International Affairs inthe United States. The widest possible participation ofnational monitors has been provided for. The leadership ofthe country has declared its commitment to conducting freeand just elections  considering it a significant event in thehistory of the Azerbaijan State.Positive developments resulting from current reformscan also be observed in the country?s economy. At theinitial stage of its formation the young Azerbaijan Statefaced internal instability  lack of a progressive legislativebasis for the market economy  disintegration of traditionaleconomic and trade relations  economic recession and ahuge budget deficit. These elements have created seriousobstacles to economic development. Armed aggression byneighbouring Armenia has had the most negative impact onthe situation in Azerbaijan. It has resulted in the occupationof one fifth of its territory  the emergence of about 1million refugees and internally displaced persons and thecontinuance of the 10-year-old blockade of the Nakhichevanregion of Azerbaijan by Armenia.The course of building a democratic society based ona market economy  taken by the leadership of the country has created the prerequisites for drastic economic reforms.Since 1995  the Government of Azerbaijan has beenimplementing a comprehensive programme of economicstabilization. Fiscal  monetary and credit policies have beenstreamlined and structural reforms to liberalize the economyhave been completed. We have achieved macroeconomicstability  as well as stability of the national currency. Infact  inflation rates have practically been reduced to zero and since 1996 steady growth in the gross domesticproduct has been restored. Internal stability achieved as aresult of the leadership?s consistent policy  as well asreforms implemented  have provided a favourable climatefor investments in the country.Today  Azerbaijan continues with the reform of itsbanking system and privatization of State-ownedenterprises. I would like to take this opportunity to thankthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank fortheir support to the stabilization programme in Azerbaijanand for financing the structural transformations in itseconomy. I would like to offer our assurances of theirreversibility of the course of economic reforms taken byour Government and to express the hope that theseimportant financial institutions will increase theirassistance to Azerbaijan.In its economic policy  our country attaches thehighest priority to its integration into the world economy.Situated at the junction of Eastern and Westerncivilization  and having been for centuries a link betweenEurope and Asia  Azerbaijan is implementing a systematicprogramme aimed at its smooth integration into the worldeconomy  and attaches great importance to thedevelopment of fruitful and mutually beneficial regionalcooperation based on mutual respect for the sovereigntyand interests of all States  as well as on the principle ofnon-interference in internal affairs of other countries.In this connection  the country?s leadership regardsas strategically important the concept of creating an East-West corridor  and in particular the development of theEurope-Caucasus-Asia transportation link. The TransportCorridor: Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA)programme  established by the Commission of theEuropean Union in 1993  is designed to promote thedevelopment of interconnected national and regionaltransportation infrastructures to enhance cooperationbetween countries in Europe  the Black Sea region  theCaucasus  the Caspian Sea region and Asia.Implementation of this programme will provide reliableaccess to the trans-European and trans-Asiantransportation systems for the landlocked countries of theCaucasus and Central Asia. During the last five yearsclose interaction between the States involved in theprogramme and active support by the Commission of theEuropean Union have contributed to substantial progressin modernization and construction of communications  thedevelopment of relevant laws and codes and the14improvement of the customs and tariff policies ofparticipant States.The results of five years of work were reviewed at theInternational Conference on the Restoration of the HistoricSilk Route  held at the capital of Azerbaijan  the city ofBaku  on 7-8 September this year. That Conference broughttogether delegations from 32 countries  including nine headsof State  and representatives of 13 internationalorganizations. The major outcome of the Conference wasthe signing of the Principal multilateral agreement oninternational transport for development of the corridorEurope-Caucasus-Asia  which is an important institutionalmechanism for promoting the development and regulationof international transportation  as well as for coordinatingand harmonizing transportation policies and legalframeworks in this field of transportation. The BakuConference has become a major cornerstone in terms ofstrengthening and enhancing cooperation aimed at thefurther development of the Europe-Caucasus-Asiatransportation corridor in the interests of the economicprogress of all the participating States.The delegation of Azerbaijan is counting on thesupport of the other Member States for this programme. Weare convinced that the restoration of the historic silk routeand the involvement of other countries and regions in thisproject would provide a strong impetus to the process ofrapprochement and reciprocal enrichment of our peoples  astrengthening of their independence and sovereignty  aswell as the successful implementation in those States ofdemocratic and market-oriented reforms.Carrying out plans to deliver carbohydrate resourcesproduced by Azerbaijan and other countries of the Caspianbasin to world markets by means of multiple pipelines is anintegral part of the East-West concept  which is ofinestimable importance for strengthening the independenceand security of sovereign States  as well as for theireconomic and other development. We expect internationalfinancial institutions and other investors to show dueinterest in these projects  which can rightly be called abridge to the third millennium.Unfortunately  however  we are obliged to admit thatthe model of the progressive development of sovereignStates of the region proposed by Azerbaijan is not acceptedby all. The position taken by Armenia in the region stillremains a serious obstacle to this process.The question of a settlement of the conflict betweenArmenia and Azerbaijan  which has lasted for more than 10years now  is a key issue in Azerbaijan?s foreign policy.Relevant resolutions of the Security Council and thedecisions of the OSCE have made it possible to create anecessary normative legal basis for the settlement of thisconflict. In this context  it is necessary in particular tostress the codifying role and universality of the principlescontained in the Lisbon statement made by the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE. These principles  namely recognition of the territorial integrity of Armenia andAzerbaijan  a high level of autonomy for NagornyKarabakh within the Azerbaijan State and the provision ofsecurity and safety for the entire population of NagornyKarabakh  are fully in keeping with the principlesenshrined in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 and arecomprehensive in nature  which makes possible theirapplication with an equal degree of effectiveness not onlyto the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan  but to allother regional conflicts as well.A positive balance has recently been achieved. Aninstitute of mediation has been created  comprising theMinsk Group of the OSCE and its Co-Chairmen. Theparameters for the settlement process have beenestablished  providing for the elimination of theconsequences of the armed conflict and  on this basis  aresolution of the political problems. As a result ofAzerbaijan?s persistence  it was possible in October 1997to find points of contiguity with Armenia?s position  andreal opportunities for progress have emerged. Thesubsequent internal political events in Armenia  however and the resulting drastic revision of its attitudes led to adecline in the dynamism of the Minsk process.A just and lasting settlement cannot be achieved byArmenia?s military pressure on Azerbaijan  by itscontinuing occupation of parts of the territory of theRepublic of Azerbaijan and by increasing its militarypotential there  by putting forward preconditions for theresumption of negotiations on the basis of the results ofArmenia?s aggression  or by imposing new proceduralframeworks on the negotiations process  in order toperpetuate the situation resulting from the conflict.Illegal transfers of arms from Russia to Armenia worth more than $1 billion  and regular joint militaryexercises of those countries designed to increase theoffensive potential of the Armenia?s armed forces notonly prevent a facilitation of the settlement  but also havea direct destabilizing impact on the situation in the region.Azerbaijan once again states its commitment to apeaceful resolution of the conflict and the strict15implementation of the ceasefire regime  until an agreementon the settlement of the armed conflict is reached  in thehopes that the same approach will be taken by theArmenian side. Azerbaijan calls on Armenia to accept theproposals of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference asa basis for negotiations within the format of the MinskGroup. Today  as never before  it is important for theinternational community to preserve its consistency determination and persistence in upholding its declaredposition on the settlement of the conflict between Armeniaand Azerbaijan.Nobody should be in any doubt that progressivedevelopment of the States of the region can only beachieved through the establishment of just and lasting peaceand stability in the southern Caucasian region on the basisof respect for sovereignty and the territorial integrity of itsStates. Azerbaijan believes that international organizations as well as the entire international community  should moreactively utilize their potential to further promote thepeaceful negotiation process and the achievement of apolitical settlement to the conflict.During its last session  in response to therecommendations of the Secretary-General  the GeneralAssembly adopted important decisions aimed at reformingthe Organization. Azerbaijan regards the work already doneto this end as a solid basis for further adaptation of theOrganization to the quickly changing needs and imperativesof today?s world. We stand ready to further contribute tothe implementation of these decisions intended to preparethe world Organization better to meet the challenges of thetwenty-first century.Undoubtedly  in this regard  the reform of the SecurityCouncil is of special importance. In our view  it isexpedient to adopt relevant decisions on this extremelysensitive issue on the basis of the broadest support ofMember States and in accordance Article 108 of theCharter. Asia  Africa and Latin America should berepresented in both categories of membership of theSecurity Council in a manner appropriate to current politicalrealities. Given the fact that the number of countries in theEastern European Group has doubled  we once again pointout the need to allocate to that Group an additional non-permanent seat on the Security Council.Addressing the question of the reform of the SecurityCouncil and the enhancement of the efficiency of its work we cannot fail to draw attention to the fact that the fourSecurity Council resolutions on the conflict betweenArmenia and Azerbaijan have still not been implemented.We have repeatedly stressed that a review of thepersonnel policy of the United Nations should be anintegral part of the Organization?s reform. We remainextremely concerned by the fact that the Republic ofAzerbaijan is still not represented in the Secretariat.It is unfortunate that emergencies arising frommilitary conflicts and acts of military aggression are stilla pressing issue today. Millions of people continue to losetheir homes  health and property  and are becominginternally displaced persons.The people of my country have experienced the painand misfortune of such a loss  having fallen victim to theArmenian aggression of which I have spoken. Everyseventh citizen of Azerbaijan bears the burdens of therefugee?s life  deprived of his home in his native land suffering from heat in summer and cold in winter intemporary tent camps. In occupied Azerbaijani territory hundreds of towns and villages have been destroyed practically all of the houses  schools  hospitals andindustrial facilities have been burned down or plunderedand ancient cultural monuments have been razed. Copingwith the refugee emergency and the restoration of whathas been lost are two of the main concerns of theAzerbaijan State. These problems cannot be resolved untilthe occupying forces are withdrawn from Azerbaijaniterritory and all the refugees and displaced persons havebeen returned to the places from which they wereexpelled by force.The Azerbaijan Government is doing a great deal toalleviate the situation. The role of the United Nations andits agencies in this process can scarcely be overestimated.In addition to providing direct humanitarian assistance torefugees and internally displaced persons  at the presenttime a project is under way to restore a part of the Fisulidistrict  which was freed from the occupying Armenianunits. This project is being carried out by the Governmentof Azerbaijan  the World Bank  the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees andother agencies and organizations. However  the emergingtrend of reduction in the volume of humanitarianassistance to Azerbaijan cannot fail to disturb us. Whileexpressing our most sincere gratitude to the UnitedNations  its specialized agencies and donor countries fortheir support and concrete assistance  we call on them notto decrease in the future the volume of their humanitarianaid to the people in Azerbaijan who are suffering fromaggression and who live in the most unbearableconditions.16I should like to advantage of this opportunity to brieflyrefer to our cooperation with UNDP  which is playing avery positive role in the social  political and economicdevelopment of our country. Assistance from UNDP  themajor source of subsidies necessary for carrying outdevelopment activities  is vital to resolve a number ofserious problems in Azerbaijan that were mentioned earlier.We welcome the system of Resident Coordinators andhighly commend the activity of the Resident Coordinator inAzerbaijan  designated by the Secretary-General  who isacting as the leader of the United Nations team in thecountry. At the same time  given the difficult financialconstraints facing UNDP  I should like to call upon allMember States to increase their voluntary contributions tothe budget of the Programme so that the recipient countries including Azerbaijan  can more effectively use its potentialto their advantage.The consolidation of efforts of Member States with aview to launching a decisive attack against crime  drugs andterrorism continues to be a priority. Combating thesephenomena can be successful only if all countries truly joinforces. Azerbaijan  which has had to confront these realthreats to its sovereignty and territorial integrity  inparticular from Armenian terrorism  considers itself anactive participant in the fight against these evils.Azerbaijan welcomes the results of the RomeDiplomatic Conference to establish an InternationalCriminal Court. We are convinced that an efficient  capable independent and authoritative court will contribute tostrengthening international cooperation for the effectiveprosecution and suppression of aggression  genocide andmilitary crimes  which are the most heinous crimesconstituting a threat to international peace and security. Asa State that is experiencing all the sufferings and tragedy ofaggression by Armenia  Azerbaijan is deeply interested inthe establishment and effective functioning of internationallegal mechanisms for the prosecution of those responsiblefor the aforementioned crimes.There are fewer than 500 days remaining until the endof this century  and we have no time to relax  no right torest on our laurels. Approaching the end of the historicnineties  the United Nations  bringing together both theprosperous States and those who have overcome numerouscalamities but have gained their independence and stability must take all necessary measures to justify the effortsalready made and to achieve the objectives that have beenset. Fulfilment of the tasks at hand and finding solutions tothe problems we face constitute the baggage that thisrespected Organization and its Member States will takewith them into the twenty-first century."
"12",452,"BDI",53,1998,"Thefifty-third session of the General Assembly provides usonce again with an opportunity to look at the overallsituation in the world and to reflect together on the futureof the peoples and the nations that we represent.But first of all  may I extend to Mr. Didier Opertti ourwarm and sincere congratulations on his well-deservedelection  which is but recognition of his intellectual andpersonal qualities and which  I am certain  will ensure thesuccess of the work of this session. We would like also topay a warm tribute to his predecessor  who presided sobrilliantly over the work of the previous session.My delegation is pleased to express appreciation forthe courageous and ongoing work being carried out byMr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  in support ofpeace in the world and particularly on the Africancontinent.When on 25 July 1996 we had to carry out a veryradical change of government in Burundi  the politicalsituation was an explosive one. Every day Burundianswere dying without really knowing why  and the threat ofgenocide and widespread chaos was a very real danger.I shall not go into the details of that situation  as theSecurity Council  the Secretary-General and hisrepresentative in Bujumbura have followed on a dailybasis the evolution of the crisis which has in recent yearsdisrupted my country.Since that change on 25 July 1996  we have statedclearly that restoration of security and the beginning of apeace process are our basic concerns.This fifty-third session provides me with anopportunity to tell you about the efforts made by thepeople of Burundi  its leaders and the internationalcommunity to attain our goals of restoring a lasting peacein the country. Despite some acts of terrorism  I can sayto this Assembly that security has now been fully restoredin Burundi. The threat of genocide so feared by its peopleis gone today. Two years ago the peace process wasinitiated; it is now under way and proceeding in a mannersatisfactory to all those concerned. I should like to focusmy statement today on this peace project.The idea of a peace-process project in Burundi isbased on the realization that despite the ethnic turn taken byviolence which brought such tragedy to my country overthe last five years  the underlying cause of the Burundicrisis is essentially a political one. That is why we arefocusing our efforts on seeking a political solution to thecrisis.Two years ago we set in motion a peace processwhich was divided into two aspects: the internal aspect andthe external aspect. At the internal level  the dynamicprovided by the peace process led to a domestic agreementon political partnership. Two years ago  the Governmentwhich emerged from the change of 25 July 1996 and theNational Assembly elected in 1993 began a dialogue gearedtowards a political rapprochement. This initiative led to anagreement on political partnership.Today  we have a provisional constitution which cameout of that partnership and which governs the institutions ofour Republic  primarily the Government and the NationalAssembly. In Burundi  the political partnership is a realitynot only between Government and the National Assemblybut also with the majority of the registered political partiesand the representatives of civil society who have joined thepartnership for peace. It is within this framework that anegotiated Government  bringing together the main politicalforces in the country  is now in place and has beenfunctioning for three months. The National Assemblyelected in 1993 has been expanded to includerepresentatives of other registered political parties andrepresentatives of civil society.I can say to this Assembly — and those who havevisited Burundi recently have been able to note thisthemselves — that this partnership has transformed  andcontinues to transform  the political landscape in Burundiin a positive way. Today  the political class within ourcountry is organizing a wide-ranging discussion on thepartnership to enable the people of Burundi to absorb theidea of peace  the ultimate objective being stabilization ofthe country through the restoration of peace.The Government  for its part  is preparing itsprogramme based on the political agreement which emergedfrom the partnership. The major issues  such as democracy justice  security and development  are in the forefront ofthis programme which the Government will be submittingto the parliament at its next session in October. MyGovernment is determined to continue consolidating thepartnership within the country. We deeply believe that thisapproach can establish the bases for an overall agreementassociating our compatriots living abroad with our peaceproject.It was the existence of this political partnership atthe domestic level which made possible the beginning ofa process of global negotiations involving Burundiansabroad in the peace process. The negotiations  bringingtogether people of Burundi living at home and abroad began on 15 June 1998 in Arusha  in the United Republicof Tanzania. The second negotiating session took place on20 July  and the third meeting is scheduled for 12October. These negotiations are proceeding in a mannersatisfactory to all the participants: the Burundians  thefacilitator and the representatives of the internationalcommunity.I should like to declare that the Government ofBurundi is resolved to do its utmost to assure the successof these negotiations. We divided the peace process intotwo aspects  domestic and external  because it is simplya question of methodology. The peace process is one andindivisible. First of all  we wanted to get the people ofBurundi involved in the peace process before the Arushanegotiations  so that we could take into consideration therecent experience of our subregion. Peace negotiationswhich do not involve the people often take a tragic turn.I should like to declare from this rostrum that thepeace process is now under way to the satisfaction of thepeople of Burundi. We are determined to resolve throughdialogue the dispute pitting Burundians one against theother. Unfortunately  there are obstacles along our pathtowards lasting peace  the main one being the economicsanctions imposed on Burundi on 31 July 1996. Theseeconomic sanctions affect in particular the mostvulnerable sectors of our society. They are destroying theeconomic and social fabric of the country and over thelong term are jeopardizing stabilization over the long termin our country. In fact  the impact of the embargo on thepeople of Burundi is devastating. Let me give you a fewfigures: grade school attendance has dropped from 70 to43 per cent; the vaccination rate has plummeted from 80to 40 per cent and malnutrition among children under theage of 5 is now 43 per cent.Moreover  the embargo imposed on Burundi is nowenriching a few individuals in the country in a scandalousmanner and is tragically impoverishing millions of peoplethere. This embargo is eroding trust between themediators and the parties to the conflict  particularly theGovernment of Burundi. Even though all the conditionsimposed by those who initiated the embargo have nowbeen met  the economic sanctions are still being2maintained. Today there is absolutely no justification  moralor political  for continuing the embargo against Burundi.I would appeal to the countries of our subregion andto the mediator organizing the negotiations in Arusha to liftthe embargo before it definitively torpedoes our peaceproject. Our appeal is also directed to the internationalcommunity for support in our effort at peace-building inBurundi.We must act now to concert our peace efforts.Tomorrow will be too late. Those who have sinned byomission will bear an important responsibility.The other significant obstacle to peace in Burundi isthe continuing violence perpetrated by armed factions basedin the territories of certain neighbouring countries. I call onthose countries to assume their share of the responsibility.One cannot both call for negotiations and tolerate terroristactions by armed groups without jeopardizing the entirepeace process. For negotiations to begin  there must be acessation of hostilities.Burundi  a landlocked country under economicsanctions  needs international solidarity. Humanitarianassistance must be stepped up in order to help thoseafflicted by this crisis. We would wish to see internationalcooperation with our country resumed without further delay.Security conditions are no worse in Burundi than in theother countries of the Great Lakes region. Burundianssimply ask to be treated fairly. Our commitment andresolve to achieve peace in Burundi through dialogue mustno longer be called into question. The facts today speak forthemselves. We are negotiating with all Burundians whohave political demands.My country?s domestic concerns will not allow me toforget the other problems afflicting Africa and the world.Far from it.At this time of globalization  a sustained effort mustbe made by the international community to promotebalanced development throughout the world. Africadeserves special attention. If one advocates developmentthrough trade  then one must also increase officialdevelopment assistance to stimulate the growth ofeconomies that remain fragile. Africa is being crushed bythe weight of its debt. The burden must be eased andeliminated for the poorest countries. Globalization withoutsolidarity with the poorest nations will not lead to apeaceful world.In order to adapt to inevitable changes  thedeveloping countries must organize themselves. Here  Ienvision the creation of regional areas of integration thatwill make our economies viable. We are in favour ofregional integration  but one that respects the identity andsovereignty of each country. We are opposed to regionalintegration that includes the domination and hegemony ofthe most powerful.Regional economic integration can be achieved however  only in secure regions. Our region of the GreatLakes remains subject to extreme instability. This cyclicalinsecurity has endured for decades and has unleashedfloods of refugees. Entire defeated armies move throughthe region  which has already experienced anunprecedented genocide.We continue to follow very carefully the evolutionof the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.I wish to reaffirm that our country  Burundi  is in no wayinvolved in that conflict. However  we remain concerned on the one hand  by a certain tenor of statement that pitspeoples against peoples on the basis of ethnic identity;and  on the other  by militias and certain rebels  whom wein the region remember only too well. I would urge allparticipants in this conflict not to allow themselves to beentrapped and led down that road  because it leads onlyto danger that could engulf the entire region in flames.Burundi will continue to ensure that its security isnot destabilized. To that end  we shall take all appropriatemeasures. We continue to advocate peaceful means anddialogue to resolve this conflict. If the Government ofBurundi is asked to contribute to a political solution  itwill be very happy to do so.In Burundi  we believe that the Organization ofAfrican Unity and the United Nations should coordinatetheir efforts more effectively in seeking a solution to thecrisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo particularly when we consider the limitations ofsubregional organizations.At the global level  every region of our planet facesvarying degrees of environmental degradation  terrorism endemic disease  drug abuse and hunger  to mention onlythe most widespread threats. To cope with this situation the United Nations will have to play a decisive role. OurOrganization has  in the past  demonstrated its strengthsand its weaknesses.To take up these many challenges  the UnitedNations must open itself up and become more democratic3if it is to become more effective in addressing the realitiesof the modern world. In order better to resolve theproblems of peace  the Security Council should bejudiciously expanded to include other Members of theOrganization.Within the United Nations  Burundi will continue toraise its modest voice against terrorism and the proliferationof weapons of mass destruction  and in favour of allocatinggreater resources to combat poverty and encourageeducation and health  particularly in developingcountries — in short  to build a more balanced and fairerworld. In our view  this is the challenge facing ourOrganization as we approach the new millennium."
"13",499,"BEL",53,1998,"I would first like to congratulate our colleague the Uruguayan Minister Didier Opertti  on his election tothe presidency of our General Assembly.I would also like to associate myself with thestatement made by our colleague  Mr. Wolfgang SchÃ¼ssel who spoke on behalf of the European Union. My countryshares and supports entirely the concerns and objectiveshe outlined.Unprecedented crises over the last few months haveshaken our economies and the economies of the entireregion. To varying degrees  the economies of the worldhave all sustained the social and political consequences ofinterdependence and the information systems that linkthem. It therefore seems to me that the time has come torethink seriously the way in which internationalinstitutions and national Governments deal with thetensions and constraints which result from globalization.This means specifically that we must reflect uponthe quality of life humankind will have in the nextcentury. Despite worrisome forecasts  we seem unable tocome up with a list of priorities which reflects the globalpublic interest. We must establish a common frame ofreference that ensures the peaceful coexistence of Statesand their citizens while at the same time respecting theirdiversity. This task is the indispensable corollary ofglobalization  which has numerous ramifications forcurrent problems. The international communityâsresponses have therefore been flawed and partial andsubject to corporate logic and a narrow view of theissues.The limitations of these responses are well known tous. Countless children died last year from diseases whichcould have been eradicated. Tropical forests covering anarea equivalent to three times the size of Belgium21disappeared. The developing worldâs debt remainsuntenably large  while expenditures for weapons continuesto grow. Incalculable numbers of people have beendetained  tortured  killed or forced to flee their countries.Hundreds of innocent victims have lost their lives interrorist attacks.Global information networks and new technologiesreduce distances. Thanks to television  more than onebillion people can today discover both manâs incredibleinventions and the worst abuses he is capable of. This is ascenario which touches our conscience.Todayâs crises affect the entire global system and callfor solutions on the same level. The only way to respondeffectively is to give a greater role to international solidarityand social justice. Those are the two pillars of the newinternational ethic that I would like to call for today. Thisis not a simple task. No Government likes to limit its roomto manoeuvre  even for just causes  if it is the only onepaying the price for its commitments.I am nevertheless convinced that the United Nationsis the best forum to have a debate on this matter ofinternational public interest. It is here  and nowhere else that we can draw up universally accepted norms that havethe approval of the largest possible number of States. TheOrganization can help us strengthen international consensusand the acceptance of codes of conduct designed to set theboundaries of human dignity and peaceful coexistence.Economic and financial power dominates the world but the last few months have shown that it is not capable ofrunning it. The globalization of political life and civilsociety leads us to attempt to reach beyond nationallimitations to confront our problems. Liberalization hasgenerated significant growth in trade and investments. It hasalso led to increased transparency between our differentsocial systems. This transparency obliges us more than inthe past to reflect upon our concepts of the rights of theindividual and the need to defend them.However  access to the global economic village hasnot led to a concomitant strengthening of solidarity. Thecapacity of men and women to adapt has been severely putto the test. The grip of the logic of the marketplace on theindividual seems to relegate him to a secondary role in theinternational system. Our societies should henceforthreconcile the often very divergent effects that globalizationhas on the individual and on the State â€” namely unemployment  competition and financial speculation. Thebalance between the freedom of some and the rights ofothers is all too often disturbed. Marginalization andabject poverty are reappearing  thereby threatening theexercise of the most fundamental of rights. After the1980s â€” a lost decade  from the point of view ofdevelopment â€” the decade of structural adjustments hasbeen unable to put economies back on the road tosustainable development. Differences in income  both atthe level of society and at the global level  have beenaccentuated. What can we do? What must we do?The Internet and the financial markets by themselvescannot hold the international community together. Weknow that Governments alone are incapable of dealingwith the problems with which they are confronted. Thisis why new forms of solidarity and new ways of dealingwith these issues are indispensable. Only a strong politicalinternational organization can counterbalance the forces ofthe financial markets. The loss of power of nation-Statesover financial and economic decisions is glaring; thesocial consequences are even more so. This does not callinto question the existing consensus on the validity ofcontrolled liberalization of trade  but it does put allGovernments up against the wall. Has the time not comefor some sort of regulation that benefits everyone?Indeed  liberalization cannot be an end in itself. Ithas no purpose if it does not contribute to social progressfor the largest possible number of people. We shouldtherefore strive together to find concerted responses to theuncontrolled and painful effects of this evolution bystrengthening public control throughout the world. In thisregard some have proposed an economic security council.This is obviously an ambitious idea  but it does serve toshow how serious the threat of financial instability andeconomic uncertainty is to our societies. In any case  anintensified dialogue between the United Nations and theBretton Woods institutions must be instituted as a firststep.Of course  regional strategies have been developedto strengthen economic convergence in certain regionsand to integrate them into zones. Nevertheless  theseregional strategies should respect the rules ofmultilateralism. Efficient partnerships based on mutualtrade have to be developed with other regions withoutmarginalizing third States. Developing countries must beintegrated in commerce and enjoy the fruits of marketliberalization. In this respect  my country supports theefforts placed on record by the European Union in thespirit referred to as â€œfair tradeâ€.22I would now like to say a few words about the UnitedNations  which is at the centre of all these interactions. Isay to you  the representatives of the 185 nations committedto the pursuit of the objectives of the United Nations  thatwe have all too often forgotten our obligations under theCharter. Now that we are free of the shackles of the coldwar and its ideological deadlocks  the obligation tostrengthen cohesion between States and to promote socialjustice is more than ever the real order of business.In this respect  I support the proposal to devote theMillennium Assembly to the issue of the fight againstpoverty. The gaze of much of the world will be turnedtowards the United Nations at that time. It would be aterrible failure if on that occasion we were only able torefer poverty to various committees  soothing ourconscience with meetings of fleeting significance. As theSecretary-General stresses in his report  the fight againstpoverty starts with good governance. Politicaldemocratization and mechanisms for revenue sharing areindispensable elements.The question of Central Africa is currently ofparticular importance for Africa. After hopes were raisedfor what some wanted to call an African renaissance  thecontinent has again become prey to violence that isbecoming dangerously ethnic in character. Once again  theprincipal victims are among the most vulnerable people inthe world.The crisis in the Great Lakes region is a moralchallenge for the United Nations. It imposes on us the dutyof solidarity. We must help Africa to find solutions and toimplement them without interfering or trying to imposesolutions. The United Nations  together with the relevantregional and subregional organizations  should involve itselfin an initiative to restore dialogue to the region and to putconfidence-building measures in place. I believe that aconference on regional security and cooperation in theGreat Lakes region â€” if it is viewed as a process ratherthan as a single event â€” could serve as the vehicle forstabilizing the region. My country is willing to support suchan initiative.Political instability  uninterrupted violence andchallenges to the nation State have led to large-scalepopulation movements. In Central Africa  Kosovo andelsewhere  hundreds of thousands of families have beenforced to flee their homes and their land. It is our sharedduty to continue to assist humanitarian organizations intheir efforts to come to the aid of these refugees and toenable them to return home. However  sometimes  when theroads or the family land are littered with landmines andchildren cannot go to school without being exposed tophysical danger  returning can be a problem. We must ridourselves of these landmines; their production must stop.These devices of death must be for ever banished fromthe Earth.I welcome the entry into force of the Convention onthe total prohibition of anti-personnel landmines andappeal to donor and victim countries to support theintegrated activities undertaken by the United Nations inthis field  including through voluntary financialcontributions.But that is not enough. Conflict prevention should bea priority  and within our Organization we must also payattention to the less spectacular aspects of conflictprevention  such as early warning and the establishmentof an appropriate United Nations presence on the ground.Conflict prevention will make no sense if we do notat the same time put an end to the acquisition of arms bythose who attempt to resolve their problems throughviolence. Belgium has responded positively to theEuropean Union initiative to formulate a code of conductfor arms transactions. My country is also a strongadvocate of giving the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms effective universal application. It isalso behind several initiatives designed to block the illegaltransfer of small arms. The Brussels conference  whichwill take place in October  and our participation on thePanel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms  providefurther examples of our commitment  which extends to allsectors of disarmament. How could it be otherwise  whensome countries consider it useful to put on an alarmingshow of their nuclear expertise?A significant contribution to ethical renewal ininternational relations was the adoption  after much work of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. It isindeed shocking that those responsible for the mostreprehensible crimes  in particular genocide  can gounpunished. Belgium has recently signed the Statute ofthe International Criminal Court and intends to work forits effective establishment. My country will also continueto support the two existing United Nations ad hoccriminal tribunals. Some countries still harbour doubtsabout that important undertaking. However  a balance hasbeen found between international security and justice. Theonly remaining question is whether we  so-called civilizednations  are prepared to adopt binding rules so as toensure respect for the most elementary and universally23accepted principles of respect for the human being andinternational coexistence. Adopting voluntary restrictions tostrengthen an international ethical code can only benefitStates and their citizens. That is truly the role of the State:to ensure that its citizens are protected â€” if necessary through international law.I do not consider it realistic to develop a global ethicalcode without working for the protection and education ofour children. Working together with other countries  theUnited Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF) and otherUnited Nations organizations  Belgium has played animportant role in a number of initiatives. I propose that theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session build upon itsachievements with respect to the definition of standards forthe protection of children. Child labour is a waste of humanbeings â€” for the girls and boys who are subjected to it andfor future generations. Market forces must yield in thisarea. Like the enlistment of child soldiers  child labour is amoral scandal that must be remedied through thedevelopment of alternatives adapted to the socioculturalcontext at the local level.One of my Governmentâs priorities is the fight againstthe most repugnant forms of exploitation. We are alarmedby the use of the Internet by those who traffic in childrenand by networks of prostitutes and all the new forms ofcrime that make a mockery of traditional methods ofdefending the rule of law. Here  too  internationalcooperation is the only solution.I am also ready to take the initiative  on the occasionof the tenth anniversary of the Convention of the Rights ofthe Child in 1999  to organize  together with UNICEF andall interested countries  a meeting in Belgium at which wecan all share our experiences with regard to our respectivelegislation.The ideas that I have outlined will be not bear fruit ifMember States do not cooperate fully with theOrganization. Denying the Secretary-General the resourcesneeded to turn the United Nations into an efficientinstrument will only make matters worse. The Secretary-General deserves our full support in his reform efforts.The Security Council is crucial for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Its reform is of concern tous all. I hope that in the not-too-distant future  a balancedenlargement of the Council can be agreed upon. The workundertaken during the past year has sometimes beendisappointing because of the stubborn resistance of severalcountries. Belgium belongs to the majority of MemberStates arguing for a strengthening of the authority of theCouncil. My country clearly laid out its position: wewould like an equal increase in the number of permanentand non-permanent members  better representation of thevarious regions and self-imposed limits on the use of theright of veto under certain conditions provided for inadvance. The privilege of veto is excessive when it isused to the detriment of the interests of the internationalcommunity as whole.The consensus proposal put forward by the group of10 has numerous advantages and offers material forfurther reflection. It is quite disturbing to see that aminority of Member States are ignoring the evolution ofinternational relations over the last 50 years while at thesame time claiming for themselves a preponderant role inthe maintenance of international peace and security.Postponing reform of the Security Council is tantamountto an assault on its credibility.The financial health of the Organization has notimproved much over the course of the last year. Belgiumbelieves that countries that accumulate arrears harm theentire international community. The damage goes beyondthe resulting debt  because the Organization is denied themeans fully to discharge its mandate. Furthermore  thereform process is jeopardized. Nothing can make up forthe damage this does to international cooperation andsocial progress. The political and moral responsibility ofthose Governments is at stake. None who speak from thisrostrum can claim their attachment to United Nationsideals without accepting the financial obligations involvedin being a Member  that is  payment in full  on time andwithout conditions of their financial contributions.In face of the excesses of the international system the international community must be on guard. Here aswell our Organization can be the worldâs conscience. Itsweighty role is to help Member States formulate adequateresponses to the globalization with which we areconfronted. It is therefore in a serious yet hopeful frameof mind that I look at the agenda of this session of theGeneral Assembly and pledge my countryâs full supportfor the work ahead of us."
"14",544,"BEN",53,1998,"Onbehalf of the delegation of the Republic of Benin  allowme to express to Mr. Didier Opertti my warmcongratulations upon his brilliant and unanimous electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession. His human skills and vast experience ininternational affairs  as well as his dedication to the maincauses of our Organization  augur well for the success ofthe important deliberations of this session. My delegationwould like to assure him of its full cooperation.I would like to take this opportunity to thankMr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine  who so skilfully anddevotedly presided over the last session of the GeneralAssembly. Allow me to associate to this tribute Mr. KofiAnnan  our Secretary-General  whose dedication and greatdiplomatic skills have given greater nobility to ourOrganization and new reasons for hope to our world. Ishould like to welcome here the efforts of this greatAfrican for the international community.My country  the Republic of Benin  could beperceived as just a dot on the world map and perhaps justas a jot on the map of Africa. In fact  the Republic ofBenin is not manufacturing any atomic bombs  nor has itany intention of building or possessing them. But it iswithout any hesitation that I am speaking before therepresentatives of the international community and all themajor Powers gathered here to express the profoundconcerns we have over the state of the world today  andto voice our hopes.Benin may be only a small point on the world map but it wants to be a point of convergence — not only inAfrica  but also for the entire international community.We want to commit ourselves to building peace rather17than bombs  and to promote international cooperation —and to promote it first at home.The Government of Benin is committed to buildingpeace by consistently cultivating tolerance and a spirit ofsharing. There is no other explanation for the ever growingconsolidation of democracy in Benin. Eschewing the wordsand customs of others  the people of Benin have boldlychosen a multi-party system after many years of curtailedpolitical freedoms. In other words  they have chosen apolitics of peace and tolerance. Today more than 100political parties vie against each other  unite or clash  butthey do so in peace and with respect for the Constitutionand the law.My delegation believes that there is no more urgenttask today than replacing the culture of violence and warwhich has marked humanity since the dawn of history andwhich has so overwhelmed and gravely afflicted Africa andother regions of the world. That culture must be replacedby the culture of peace. We believe that the foremost dutyof our Organization continues to be the promotion of peaceand all its values and the behaviour that underpins andstrengthens it.We believe that the first of these values is the spirit ofsharing. There can be no peace in the world if a smallportion of humanity can surf the Internet and exploreinterstellar space while others flounder in quagmire  seekinga mere pittance or safe shelter in their flight from warswhose root cause is a desire to retain power — the powerto control land  gold  oil  diamonds and other naturalresources solely for the benefit of arms dealers.This apocalyptic picture is unfortunately typical of thesad situation in Africa. It is therefore important to unite allour efforts to halt all conflicts  not only in Africa  but alsoin Europe  the Balkans — indeed  wherever they arise.The spirit of tolerance and sharing has prompted myGovernment to develop the concept of a common socialminimum. This means that all citizens of Benin  whereverthey reside  must be able to feed  house  clothe  care forand educate themselves. It would be desirable for acommon social minimum to be proclaimed as an essentialobjective on the global scale.I should like to pause here to commend the efforts andgreat sacrifices made by various Governments andinternational organizations — particularly the Organizationof African Unity (OAU)  the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS)  through its MonitoringGroup (ECOMOG) and the United Nations itself — torestore peace to Liberia  Sierra Leone  Angola  Ethiopia Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Whether in Africa or the Balkans  what lastingsolution can possibly be imposed by force of arms today?Why do Mr. Savimbi and those who support him  eithercovertly or overtly  refuse to see that the time for peacehas come for the martyred people of Angola?With respect to all those conflicts in Africa  theRepublic of Benin welcomes the report (A/52/871)presented by the Secretary-General at the request of theSecurity Council on the causes of conflict in Africa. TheSecretary-General?s appeal deserves to be heard andsupported  not only by Africans but also by all thosewhose political  economic or financial decisions willinfluence the future of the continent.If the spirit of peace  sharing and tolerance prevailedin the Middle East  the long-delayed peace wouldundoubtedly be established there. We have learned inrecent days of the efforts which have been resumed somany times by the United States of America to end thestagnation of the peace process  for whichMr. Netanyahu?s Government is principally responsible.Let us hope that peace will have a better chance this time.One of the main items on our agenda is thestrengthening of the non-proliferation regime and thebanning of nuclear tests. In this connection  the Republicof Benin welcomes the decision by India and Pakistan tosign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT). We have no particular lesson for thosetwo great countries  which are our friends. But it is clearto us that the possession of atomic bombs cannot offereither of them a lasting victory; only a prosperous countryand people can confer that.Humanity will continue to be under threat until thecurrent stockpile of nuclear weapons is destroyed. Themajor nuclear Powers must today admit this self-evidenttruth.While nuclear weapons pose a permanent danger tous all  small arms in my country sow permanentinsecurity and hamper our economic development efforts.Last May a group of heavily armed gangsters attacked abank in broad daylight right in the middle of Cotonou killing security guards and making off with tens ofmillions of francs. If small arms were not available  suchincidents and armed conflicts would certainly be less18common  and outlaws would not be as terrifyingly effectiveas they are today in numerous countries where ill-equippedpolice and militias cannot resist them. The massacre mustbe stopped  first and foremost by dealing with those whoare primarily responsible — the producers and exporters ofsmall arms.That is why Benin supports the conclusions of theInternational Conference on the Proposed Moratorium forSmall Arms Transfers in West Africa  which was held inOslo  Norway  from 1 to 2 April 1998.It has been said that a hungry man is not a free man.I have spoken at length about arms  conflicts and warsbecause  basically  my delegation is hopeful that by banningthe former we can more easily end or at least diminish thelatter.On the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  it is important to emphasizethat the affirmation of human rights must go hand in handwith the eradication of poverty. We cannot speak seriouslyabout human rights  liberty or democracy in a countrywhere the people have neither bread nor schools.My country hopes that bold and vigorous measureswill be taken  particularly by the richest countries  so thatthose whom globalization leaves inexorably by the waysidecan be given a chance to enter the twenty-first century witha little more hope. The bold measures must relate inparticular to the issues of debt and the allocation ofadditional resources for development.Like many other countries in Africa  Asia andAmerica  the Republic of Benin has taken control of itsdestiny by carrying out reforms that have often proved verydifficult. Even if our development partners are standingbeside us  these reforms and efforts express first andforemost the desire of our States and our peoples to takecharge and to emerge from underdevelopment and poverty.And we have begun to obtain results. In my country  forexample  economic growth has now surpassed demographicgrowth.We must carry our burden even if we have to do soon our knees; we must not let it fall. I therefore call uponall those responsible for making economic decisions at theglobal level to support more vigorously the efforts ofcountries whose burden has brought them to their knees.In this context  I should like to reaffirm theimportance that the Government of Benin attaches to theoperational development activities of the United Nationssystem  which  we are pleased to say  are aimed atenabling the recipient countries to take control of theirown development. We believe that the decline incontributions to core resources for funds and programmessuch as the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  the United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF)and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is adangerous handicap. The Government of Benin hopes thatthe donor countries will demonstrate greater solidarity byincreasing the resources that they allocate to thoseinstitutions.Nevertheless  I should like to thank all of the funds programmes and specialized agencies of the UnitedNations whose technical and financial support in the pastfive years has been decisive in enabling us to pursueprogrammes aimed at constructing a State based on therule of law and building a prosperous nation in which allthe citizens of Benin can have a minimum of theircommon social requirements met. I should also like towelcome all the initiatives of the United Nations system which have long been working for the development ofAfrica  as well as the actions of all our developmentpartners  in particular Japan  which have ranked thedevelopment and economic recovery of the continentamong their priorities.Although they may be positive and praiseworthy initiatives to benefit Africa must henceforth meet thefundamental needs and priorities of the African countries.It is in this spirit that in several days? time Benin will beparticipating in the second Tokyo InternationalConference on African Development (TICAD II). Ourhope  which many others share  is that that Conferencewill go beyond the declaration that will no doubt beadopted and lead to a programme of concrete actionaimed at finding solutions to the problems of thecontinent at the close of the twentieth century.At the beginning of my statement I referred to thespirit of tolerance and sharing. I believe that ourOrganization is the pre-eminent forum in which we canlearn and refine this spirit. Despite all the criticism  theUnited Nations has  to date  proved irreplaceable. Wemust continue to try to refine it and to carry out reforms.In conclusion  therefore  I would like to reaffirm thatthe reform of the United Nations  which was begun underthe bold initiative of Mr. Kofi Annan  deserves to be19supported and developed so as to guarantee the necessaryconditions for the harmonious pursuit of the process ofdemocratizing international relations at the dawn of the nextmillennium. If we want to begin the twenty-first centurywith self-confidence  and if we want the efforts andsacrifices that have been made thus far on the tortuous andrugged path to development not to have been in vain  wemust do our utmost to focus greater attention on theprinciple of world partnership and the duty of solidarity which is what the new international order necessarilyimplies.The twenty-first century may become one in which ablind global economy using the most sophisticated scienceand technology at the same time enslaves three quarters ofhumanity. This must not happen. Let us act now so that thenext century can become the century of civilization parexcellence  the century of sharing and of solidarity  thecentury of culture and the century of peace. The Republicof Benin is ready to play its part in this necessary struggle."
"15",590,"BFA",53,1998,"It is not without some emotion that I appear before thisAssembly both as Head of State of Burkina Faso andcurrent Chairman of the Organization of African Unity(OAU)  to extol  here in this sanctuary of nations  peaceand harmony between human beings.To promote peace and security for our era and forfuture generations is the objective of the nations of theworld gathered here. It is also the message which I bringon behalf of Africa  being convinced that  armed with thisimmense hope  the Organization for African Unity andthe United Nations  intimately linked  can make a realityof humanity’s legitimate aspiration to a better destiny.But first  I should like to congratulate you  Sir  aswell as the other members of the Bureau  upon yourelection and the confidence placed in you to bring thework of this fifty-third session to a successful conclusion.I also congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Udovenko  onthe energy with which he discharged his duties.Mr. Secretary-General  I would like to address mycongratulations to you and your staff on the work youhave done in so little time and offer my encouragement16for the battles still to be won. It is entirely to the credit ofthe whole United Nations system that it carries the torch ofpeace higher every day.The century which is drawing to its close will beremembered as one of great challenges. Seriously shaken bythe two world conflicts  it also mustered the necessaryresources to sound the death knell of colonialism andapartheid.The liberation of colonized peoples and territories washistorically necessary to ensure greater justice  tranquillityand well-being for our civilization  a civilization whichfinally understood that its survival lay in the organizationof a genuine collective security. But the cold war  whichled to bipolar confrontation exacerbated by ideologicalantagonism  made this security illusory. International peaceand security have not been consolidated with the end of thecold war. Conflicts and disturbances which no authoritycould contain quickly followed. The resurgence of thesecrises and the inadequacy of the solutions proposed toresolve them bring to mind the plight of the Danaïdes those mythological beings who were condemned to fill upa bottomless barrel.The international community’s failure to restore peaceto Somalia and to prevent genocide in Rwanda will standout in the history of the African continent. This failure hasundoubtedly greatly contributed to awakening our somewhatlethargic consciences and forcing us to confront ourselves.It has revealed to Africa  which may still have had itsdoubts  the limitations of the United Nations.The twentieth century thus ends with thisacknowledgement  which  though shocking for more thanone reason to those still lulled by the illusions of an age-oldhumanism  is at least realistic and belongs to the new erathat is beginning. It is an acknowledgment that the UnitedNations  to which Africa has given so much  cannot doeverything for the continent in its struggle to quell thenumerous hotbeds of tension and ensure its development.The conclusion to be drawn from this fact is self-evident:Africa must recognize this reality and come to terms withit.The thirty-fourth Assembly of Heads of State andGovernment of the Organization of African Unity  held inOuagadougou on 8-10 June 1998  devoted the thrust of itsdeliberations to this new reality  which challenges andcommands Africa to take control of its own destiny.Assessing the scope and importance of theresponsibilities this entails  and which are theirs toassume  the heads of States took the decision to affirmtheir common will to focus fully — more than in thepast — on the prevention  management and resolution ofAfrican conflicts. This commitment will certainly ensuregreater visibility both for the Organization of AfricanUnity and for the continent’s various regionalorganizations in their search for peaceful solutions tothese conflicts.Though Africa’s experience in taking control of itsown affairs is still quite recent  encouraging results havebeen recorded in the management and resolution ofcertain conflicts  results which deserve to be saluted here.The task  therefore  is not beyond the capacity ofAfricans.It is my ardent wish that this experience be extendedto the whole continent  to the most ancient crises as wellas the most recent. From north to south  from east towest  Africa must henceforth more systematically involveitself in the management and settlement of conflictswherever prevention was not enough  where it did notsucceed in guaranteeing peace.To this end  initiatives to strengthen the continent’scapacity to respond quickly to crises have been generatedby Africans themselves. The advantage they have over allother initiatives is that they are African. In order to bedeveloped and implemented  they need the unequivocalsupport of the international community. Subregion bysubregion  they need to be developed  without exceptionand in harmony.Preventing  managing and resolving the conflicts inAfrica  whose number and complexity are increasinglydisturbing  requires solid and reliable mechanisms appropriate to local conditions  mechanisms dedicated tothe cause of peace  without which Africa cannotundertake sustainable development.Clearly  the world’s problems are immense  complexand alarming. The extreme difficulty of dealing with theestablishment of peace in isolation gives multilateraldiplomacy an ever-growing role in the resolution ofconflicts.The United Nations and regional organizations suchas the Organization of African Unity can bring a greatdeal to this task. The OAU  for example  possesses aMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management and17Resolution. Created in Cairo in 1993  this Mechanism whose effectiveness and practicality we are working toensure  should to be the crucible in which a genuinepreventive diplomacy can be forged.That is all the more imperative since the consequencesof conflicts  whether internal or international  are alwaysdevastating.At the institutional level  therefore  we are equipped torespond to conflicts  and we also have the will to do so for  as I emphasized during the thirty-fourth OAU summit “the issue of security and peace in Africa is primarilyof concern to Africans. No mechanism has any chanceof succeeding effectively over time if it is imposedfrom outside.”Of course  external solidarity  if it is sincere  willalways be welcome  given that in such a complex andchanging field concerted and resolute action can only bebeneficial. I have already emphasized that the managementof conflict situations often requires the deployment of alevel of human  material and financial resources beyond thecapacities of our countries. Thus  international organizationsshould continue to show solidarity and partnership withAfrica.I therefore call upon the United Nations  with itswealth of experience  to contribute not only tostrengthening structurally the Mechanism for ConflictPrevention  Management and Resolution in Africa  but alsoto provide technical and logistical support  since in the endwe share the same ideal: assuring for our world the securityand peace essential to its development and flourishing.In this test of international solidarity  one thing iscertain: Africa must definitively and first of all rely uponitself. We Africans are aware that in order to be masters ofour destiny we must forge it ourselves. In response to thisimperative no sacrifice has been spared by any State of ourcontinent to establish an internal climate that is conduciveto growth and sustainable development. After the years ofuncertainty and stagnation  Africa has entered a new era marked by clear economic recovery in the wake of boldreforms and characterized by greater austerity andrationality in the management of public and State affairs.This movement towards transparency in management andgood governance has been accompanied by theestablishment of homogeneous subregions in which thecommon destiny of Africans is daily forged  thanks to thesustained harmony of our principles and policies ofintegration  the ultimate objective of which is theestablishment of an African economic community in thefirst half of the twenty-first century.At present Africa faces two challenges: peace andpolitical stability on the one hand  and sustainabledevelopment on the other. In their struggle and dailyefforts to emerge from underdevelopment  AfricanGovernments and peoples are not alone. They know howto rely on the sincere support of their friends. Thisincludes the operational development system of theUnited Nations  which I should like to commend for itsdedication to the uplifting struggle against poverty andother forms of deprivation that afflict African peoples.It is therefore regrettable that the United Nationsagencies that are at the heart of the struggle for humansecurity in Africa — such as the United NationsDevelopment Programme and the United NationsChildren’s Fund  to cite only two examples — are seeingtheir financial resources slowly dwindle while the missionentrusted to them calls for a redoubling of efforts andresources. That is why I call upon all to demonstrate theirgoodwill by contributing to the operational developmentsystem of the United Nations the resources it needs inorder to assist Africa in confronting the challenges ofpeace and development.The same goes for the question of debt. It would bedesirable for the eligible countries to have their debtrescheduled at the same time as they are initiatingreforms. It hardly needs recalling that debt is anunbearable burden for our still fragile economies.Globalization offers us the means and advantagesrequired to succeed in the boldest undertakings  providedthat we clearly define our objectives and involve ourpeoples in the challenge of propelling Africa along thepath of progress. It is incontrovertible that globalization which implies a spirit of partnership  limits theindependence and initiatives of States. But can humanitycontinue to flourish if the gap between rich and poornations  between the affluent and the destitute within thesame nation  grows inexorably?The time has therefore come to rethink seriously theresponsibility of international institutions in the regulationof the globalized economy in order to ensure a balancebetween economic growth and social prosperity. To do18that  it is more than indispensable and more than timely toengage in a restructuring of the United Nations  andespecially of the Security Council  in order to make it atrue instrument for the application of the principles ofjustice  equity and democracy.Africa accounts for one third of the Members of theUnited Nations. That is why it is unacceptable that  aftermore than 50 years of our Organization’s existence  anentire continent — Africa — should be absent from thepermanent membership of the Security Council  which paradoxically  debates problems that are for the most partAfrican.If the United Nations were to apply the principle ofequity  would the sanctions against the Libyan ArabJamahiriya continue despite the opinion of the InternationalCourt of Justice and  above all  despite the decisions andresolutions of heads of State in the Organization of AfricanUnity  the League of Arab States  the Organization of theIslamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement callingfor those sanctions to be lifted? Today Security Councilresolution 1192 (1998) has underscored the primacy of lawfor resolving this dispute  and the majority of nations withinour world Organization hope that conditions of transparencywill be met so that the trial can be concluded  in theinterest of the victims and the Libyan people.Moreover  Africa hopes that the Security Council willdispatch a mission of inquiry to the Sudan in the wake ofthe bombing of the pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum.Africa forcefully condemns terrorism in all its formsand manifestations and calls upon our world Organizationto create the necessary conditions for a frank debate of thisissue and for strong and concerted action against thisphenomenon  while keeping in mind that unresolved angersand frustrations born of economic or historical conditionsrestrict our capability to act.In the same vein  can the United Nations continue todeny the legal and international reality of a State such asthe Republic of China on Taiwan  whose 22 million womenand men are excluded from making any contribution to theactivities of our Organization?I am among those who believe that Africa is on thepath of hope. I remain convinced that the economic political  cultural and social obstacles that confront Africacall forcefully for its children to rediscover the road tounity that will allow them to take effective control oftheir destiny. Without union  Africa will remain on theperiphery of history. Common sense tells us that weAfricans must once and for all rid ourselves of that imageof the outstretched hand that bedevils us and build thecovenants of friendship  dignity and pride that will conferso much solidarity and generosity. This quest forindependence does not deny the importance of solidarityamong peoples. It means reaching a new understanding ofhuman rights and the rights of peoples; it means taking onthe responsibility of knowing how to remain ourselves."
"16",633,"BGD",53,1998,"May I convey to you  Sir on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  ourfelicitations on your unanimous election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. With a personof your eminence and experience in the Chair  our sessionis assured of a successful outcome.To your predecessor  Hennadiy Udovenko  I expressour deep appreciation for a job well done. We truly had areform Assembly. It was a matter of great satisfaction forBangladesh to support his brilliant work on United Nationsreform  especially through our role as the Chairman of theAdministrative and Budgetary Committee. We areparticularly grateful that  at the concluding meeting of thefifty-second session  he appealed to the internationalcommunity for solidarity with the people of Bangladesh ata time when our country was inundated by the worst floodsin our history.In this yearâs unprecedented floods  two thirds of ourcountry was completely inundated and nearly 31 millionpeople were affected. Over 20 million were renderedhomeless. Immense damage was done to crops  roads bridges  clinics  schools and industrial plants. With thereceding of the flood waters  we are bracing ourselves forthe even greater problems of water-borne diseases andscarcity of food and safe drinking water  compounded byhomelessness and unemployment. Under the directsupervision of Prime Minster Sheikh Hasina  we arereaching out to the affected people with assistance. Theenormous scale of damage challenges us with a task ofcolossal magnitude. The cost of relief  rehabilitation andreconstruction has been estimated at approximately $900million.The United Nations system  I am happy to say  hasresponded to our needs and requirements  as have ourdevelopment partners and many friendly countries. Onbehalf of the Government and the people of Bangladesh  wewould like to express our sincere thanks to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his support for and solidarity withBangladesh at this hour of need. We are also thankful tothe diplomatic missions stationed in Dhaka  theinternational organizations  non-governmental organizationsand Bangladesh nationals abroad for their continuedsupport  understanding and sympathy towards Bangladeshand its efforts to face the challenges. I reiterate here theappeal made by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for thegenerous and continuing support of the internationalcommunity to Bangladesh in the coming days.Floods are not unknown in Bangladesh. Flooding aswe have been experiencing this year is unprecedentedboth in magnitude and duration. The Secretary-General inhis annual report has referred to threats to humansecurity  including natural disasters. Indeed  of all naturaldisasters floods cause the most widespread havoc andmisery.Bangladesh  of course  is not the only country tohave suffered severe flooding this monsoon season. Thecause of this yearâs floods may well be complex. Wecannot help but be perturbed  however  by the observationin the Human Development Report of this year that globalwarming could permanently flood large areas and playhavoc with harvests. The report cautions that the humanconsequences of global warming can be devastating formany poor countries like Bangladesh  which could see itsland area shrunk by as much as 17 per cent with a onemetre rise in sea level.Elements and factors that affect the global ecosystemand the environment are interlinked. They transcendnational frontiers and can be addressed meaningfully onlyby nations acting in concert. It is a matter of survival formany peoples  and the highest priority should be given tothis issue. We have come a long way since Rio  and yet very few tangible benefits have been achieved in theabsence of promised new and additional resources.Since assuming office following elections in June1996  our Government has been trying to put in place andstrengthen institutions and laws that will reinforcedemocracy and promote good governance. In Decemberlast year  we negotiated an end to the long-standingproblem in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The ChittagongHill Tracts Agreement was concluded within theframework of our Constitution  and it fully meets thelegitimate concerns of the tribal population. We are nowputting into place the necessary laws and institutionalmachinery pertaining to the Agreement and wideningdevelopmental activities in the area. My Governmentwelcomes cooperation in this effort from all ourdevelopment partners.Our commitment to democracy and the rule of lawhas prompted us to accord priority to human rights. Weare in the process of setting up an independent national28human rights commission. Our objective is to take thehuman rights issue to the grass-roots level  to increaseawareness among our people of their rights that have beenguaranteed by our Constitution and to make the process ofjustice accessible and affordable to all. A lot remains to bedone  and we have made a good beginning.Bangladesh believes in the centrality of the right todevelopment within the human rights regime. Theimplementation of the right to development will be furtherenhanced through a binding international treaty on thisright. We are therefore very pleased that at the recentsummit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban  theheads of State and Government endorsed our PrimeMinsterâs proposal that consideration be given to thepreparation of a convention on the right to development.At home we have also embarked on a comprehensiveprogramme of reform and deregulation. Social developmenthas remained the main focus of our development strategy.Education  health care  employment generation andwomenâs empowerment within the broad framework ofhuman development continue to receive priority attention.We are focusing on the rights of women and children. Therole and involvement of civil society in our developmentefforts  particularly in the social sector  have beenremarkable.The process of globalization and liberalization bringsrisks  grave challenges and opportunities  but in unequalways. The external economic shocks associated with thisprocess are too powerful for the vulnerable economies toabsorb. This is now being recognized even by thebeneficiaries of globalization. As has been said  theglobalization process must reflect a more inclusive visionof shared interests and shared values. We would support theviews of the Secretary-General of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that aglobal economy should mean that no one will be leftbehind.We need to ensure that the process of globalizationand liberalization meets our development needs. We needto formulate a positive and workable agenda for ensuringthat globalization promotes equity and benefit for all. Anintegral component of the globalization process is unfetteredmovement of the factors of production  including capitaland labour. We need to encourage migration of labour inorder to ensure balance in globalization.Official development assistance in real terms hasdeclined by more than 15 per cent from 1992 to 1996. Thisdecline must be halted and reversed. For the poorest andmore vulnerable economies  official developmentassistance remains indispensable. We call on alldeveloped countries to reach the agreed target of 0.7 percent for the developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per centfor the least developed countries as soon as possible preferably by 2000.The least developed countries represent the mostvulnerable economies and peoples of the world. Theministerial communiquÃ© issued after the 1998 substantivesession of the Economic and Social Council underscoredcertain timely issues. In particular  I would mention thecall for working together for enhanced market access forthe least developed countries and to support their effortsat capacity-building. We also welcome the call for furtherprogress towards zero tariff on exports from leastdeveloped countries.Preferential treatment accorded to least developedcountries should not be time-bound. The restrictive traderegimes of labour and environmental standards should bemade flexible. We need to adequately prepare to addressthese and other relevant issues in the forthcoming ThirdUnited Nations Conference on the Least DevelopedCountries  to be held in 2001.The situation in the least developed countries inparticular makes it clear that the eradication of povertycontinues to be our overriding concern. It is essential toensure long-term global security  as well as to achievesustainable  economic and social development. We believethat the goal of the Microcredit Summit held last year  toreach 100 million of the worldâs poorest families especially the women of those families  will become areality by the year 2005. Effective microcreditprogrammes provide access to small capital to peopleliving in poverty in many countries of the world. Inaddition to the eradication of poverty  the microcreditprogrammes have also been contributing to the social andhuman development process  particularly theempowerment of women.As the Secretary-General has noted in his annualreport  the world has been free from large-scale regionalconflict over the past year. Peace on a global scale and ina meaningful sense  however  still remains a distant goal.The post-cold-war reality underscores that we need tobuild a culture of peace based on the principles enshrinedin the United Nations Charter and on respect for humanrights  democracy  tolerance and wider and equalparticipation of people in all spheres of human activity.We welcome the proclamation of the year 2000 as theInternational Year for the Culture of Peace and the29proposed proclamation of the period 2001 to 2010 as theinternational decade for the culture of peace and non-violence for the children of the world. The Secretary-General has been requested to submit a draft declarationand programme of action on the culture of peace to thissession. We hope it will be possible for the GeneralAssembly to adopt these documents at the earliestopportunity.We are particularly concerned that hopes for a just lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East are yetto be fulfilled. The framework for such a peace exists in therelevant Security Council resolutions  the principles of theMadrid Conference and the Oslo accords. The principle ofland for peace has been accepted by all  and yet ourPalestinian brethren continue to be frustrated in their hopesand aspirations. New settlements  expansion of theJerusalem municipal area and large-scale internment ofPalestinians without fair trial cannot promote the cause ofpeace. Bangladesh strongly believes that nothing should beallowed to thwart the peace process. We would urge thatevery moral pressure and persuasion be brought to bearupon the Israeli authorities so that the peace process canprogress to its logical culmination. We look forward to theearly establishment of an independent  sovereign State ofPalestine  with Jerusalem as its capital  and to its fullmembership of the United Nations.The cause of the sufferings of our brothers and sistersin many African countries  particularly in the Great Lakesregion  needs to be addressed more comprehensively. Therecent plight of the people of Kosovo is a stark reminder ofthe not-so-distant events of Bosnia. Peace initiatives inAfghanistan have yet to make any headway. Peace in thatcountry has to be built from within. The problem ofAfghanistan can only be resolved by the Afghan peoplethemselves  without outside interference. In such cases  webelieve in the significant role that the United Nations canplay as a peace-builder.In the area of arms control and disarmament  somenoteworthy progress has been made. The OttawaConvention on anti-personnel landmines will soon comeinto force. We welcome the decision of the Conference onDisarmament to set up committees on security assurancesto non-nuclear-weapon States and also on fissile materials.For Bangladesh  the pursuit of general and completedisarmament is a constitutional commitment  and we areready to support any and every move that contributes to thisobjective. The nuclear tests in South Asia have been thesubject of much debate  discussion and concern. In thisconnection  the initiative of Bangladeshâs Prime MinisterSheikh Hasina Wajed to minimize tensions in the regionthrough personal visits and by urging all concerned tocontribute towards strengthening peace in South Asia andthe world has been widely appreciated. We attach greatimportance and priority to our relations with ourneighbouring countries. We are happy at theannouncement of moratoriums on further nuclear testing and we remain committed to the goal of a nuclear-weapons-free world. We believe that the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  towhich Bangladesh is a party  provide useful frameworksfor establishing a nuclear-weapons-free world. It was apity to observe that consensus could not be reached in theConference on Disarmament to set up an ad hoccommittee for nuclear disarmament.Last year  our Secretary-General submitted to theGeneral Assembly a package of reform proposals to makethe United Nations more streamlined and attuned topresent-day problems and realities. Some major decisionswere  in fact  adopted by the fifty-second session on thebasis of these proposals. This session of the Assembly we believe  will continue the reform process  resolving inparticular the issues relating to the development account results-based budgeting and the so-called sunset clause.Reforms have  by definition  to be a continualprocess. The United Nations has to be adapted to newconditions and problems. On this there can be no twoopinions. For the past five years we have been discussingthe issue of Security Council reform and expansion. Wehave articulated our particular concerns in differentworking groups and forums. At the recent Non-AlignedMovement summit in Durban  the Movementâs collectiveposition was reaffirmed. I would also stress that it is theweaker and more vulnerable group of countries that hasthe most vital stake in a dynamic and effective UnitedNations and its Security Council. These countriesconstitute a clear majority among the 185 Member States and their concerns should not be overlooked or glossedover in any reform or restructuring exercise. Whilestalemate continues in this area  we are pleased that anInternational Criminal Court has seen the light of the dayafter so many years of efforts. Despite shortcomings  theCourt is a milestone in United Nations history.Bangladesh attaches great importance to thecoordinated and integrated follow-up to the decisionstaken at the major United Nations conferences of the1990s  as an area which contributes effectively to thereform process. We believe that the outcomes of theseconferences provide the international community with the30most important opportunity to ensure a better life for thepeoples of the world at the outset of the twenty-firstcentury. In particular  we call for concerted efforts toensure the success of the special session of the GeneralAssembly next June for the follow-up to the Cairopopulation conference. We also welcome the proposedmillennium Assembly session and hope that it will look intothe issues that will challenge us in the coming decades.This Assembly session should be our outreach into thefuture.The end of all political efforts  as a former UnitedNations Secretary-General once observed  must be the well-being of the individual in a life of safety and freedom. Thisis a goal to which no one is averse. It is also somethingthat no nation can achieve on its own in a world that isincreasingly interdependent. Peace and security anddevelopment in a real sense are indivisible.Despite the increasing complexities it faces every day the United Nations is functioning today more effectivelyand efficiently than before. In recent times it has played afar more constructive and positive role. The United Nations of course  has its critics and  indeed  may even benefit fromconstructive criticism. There is always scope for change andimprovement. The United Nations has had its share offailures  which so often seem much more glaring than itsquiet successes. There can be no doubt that it remains thesole universal platform for humanity to chart its future inthe new millennium."
"17",679,"BGR",53,1998,"Allow me  on behalf ofthe Bulgarian delegation  to congratulate Mr. Opertti on hiselection to the presidency of the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly and to wish him every success inguiding this important session to tangible results.I would like also to express our appreciation toMr. Udovenko for the proficiency and insight with whichhe presided over the fifty-second session.The Republic of Bulgaria  as an associated country has aligned itself with the statement on behalf of theEuropean Union  delivered by Mr. Wolfgang Schüssel Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs ofAustria.While the search for new approaches and responsesto the processes of globalization confronts humanity withnew challenges  existing cases of conflict  unrest andunderdevelopment bear the mark of the divisions andconfrontations of past decades. The question we have toaddress now is whether the next millennium will be oneof continued unrest and confrontation or one of peace andprosperity for all United Nations Member States  big orsmall.Globalization and interdependence are bringingprofound changes to the world we live in. An increasingnumber of issues  such as the economic and financialcrisis  organized crime  terrorism and regional conflicts cannot be effectively resolved by individual countries.Therefore  international cooperation is more necessarythan ever.Today we are combining our efforts against the newglobal threat  terrorism. But we must not forget thatterrorism appears mainly in unstable regions or weakcountries  and from there spreads to the rest of the world.That is why the problems of such unstable countries canneither remain their own responsibility  nor evenproblems of their regions. The problems seem to be muchmore global. The question today is how to combat thecriminal world  how to manage crisis and regionalconflicts  how to feed and shelter refugees. Tomorrow thequestion will be how to guarantee democratic stabilitythrough long-term engagements. The other approach isonly to react to the consequences  thus adding newproblems. Such an approach does not solve the problem but becomes part of it; moreover the problem ismultiplied through its negative influence on neighbouringcountries.We also believe that economic security is anessential part of the framework in which our efforts tomake a better world are made. We are convinced thatsecurity can be guaranteed not by “hot money”  but onlythrough real  long-term investments  which are crucial fora successful economic restructuring.27Bulgaria has managed to gain some knowledge andexperience in handling the problems of the reform process.In the past year and a half the Government has managed toachieve: first  economic stability as a basis for movingforward with structural reform and sustainable economicgrowth; secondly  modernization of the publicadministration; and  thirdly  efficient enforcement of therule of law in civil society.Resolute steps have been taken  in compliance withthe Government programme “Bulgaria — 2001”  totranslate into practice the new foreign policy priorities. Atits core are the integration of Bulgaria into the Europeanand transatlantic political  economic and defence structures and the creation of a climate of confidence  stability andcooperation in South-Eastern Europe.We are now engaged in active diplomatic effortsaimed at promoting the principles of democracy andstability in the region of South-Eastern Europe in order tocontribute to the peaceful settlement of conflicts. I wouldalso like to stress that my country has already achievedsignificant progress in another important area  combatingorganized crime and corruption and promoting regionalcooperation in this field.Let me now address the complex situation in theBalkans. I would like to note the progress made in theimplementation of the Dayton Agreement. We consider thatthe extended presence of the Stabilization Force (SFOR)would contribute to the consolidation of peace and stabilityin this region.Bulgaria is particularly concerned about the continuingtension in Kosovo. The crisis has reached a point wherethere is no more room for general statements and palliativesolutions. The conflict in Kosovo has resulted inthousands of civilian casualties. There is a serious threat ofdeepening the crisis and a substantial risk of spillover toother parts of South-Eastern Europe. We are convinced thatthe only credible instrument for solving the problem isnegotiations between the parties involved  which have toexamine in a responsible manner all proposals for apeaceful settlement. We support Security Council resolution1199 (1998) adopted yesterday.It is worth pointing out that as early as last FebruaryBulgaria proposed that the countries generating stability inthe region should unite their efforts in search of a peacefulsolution to this problem. The joint declarations of theForeign Ministers of countries of South-Eastern Europe adopted on the initiative of Bulgaria  reflect the will ofthese countries to make their contribution to the efforts ofthe Contact Group. They also illustrate the new spirit inrelations between the States in the region and theirresponsible approach to security and stability. For the firsttime in many years our countries managed to put asidetheir differences so as to elaborate and express a commonposition on a problem of immediate concern. Thisapproach sets the groundwork for the establishment of apolitico-diplomatic mechanism for crisis management andprevention.In our view  those States which would like tocontribute to stability and security in the region have totake into consideration the interests and positions of thecountries situated there. A common understanding hasbeen expressed that any measures aimed at settling theproblems of the region  sanctions included  should takeinto account the political and economic stability of South-Eastern Europe. They should not infringe upon theinterests of the countries involved. Therefore  we believethat efficient measures should be of a political  and not ofan economic  character.28An issue of special relevance for Bulgaria and also  Ibelieve  for other countries of the region  is the negativeimpact on the national economy of the strict implementationof the economic sanctions imposed until recently by theSecurity Council on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Asis well known  Bulgaria strictly abided by the Council?sdecisions  suffering as a result economic losses which havealmost been equal to Bulgaria?s foreign debt for three years.Given the continued relevance of that issue internationally Bulgaria supports the view that since all provisions of theCharter are of equal importance  assistance to third Statesaffected by sanctions has to be taken into considerationtogether with the imposition of sanctions. The elaborationof a concrete United Nations mechanism for this purpose istherefore of the utmost importance.It is incumbent upon the United Nations to find waysand means of alleviating the negative consequences ofsanctions with regard to third States. It is our view thatcloser and more direct participation in the whole process byall third States which could be adversely affected by theimposition of sanctions is necessary. We are confident thatdiscussion of this issue at the present session will yieldmore concrete results in accordance with the decisionsalready adopted and the report of the Secretary-General tobe submitted under resolution 52/162.We are convinced that lasting stability in South-Eastern Europe is possible only through multilateral securitycooperation coupled with effective economic infrastructural  cultural  information and other integratedlinks to other parts of Europe. In this regard  the expansionof the European and transatlantic organizations to South-Eastern Europe will create a belt of security in the area andprevent possible regional crises in the future.As an integral part of Europe  Bulgaria regards ouraccelerated accession to the European Union and fullmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) as an expression of our political choice based onbroad public support. These priorities are embedded in thenational security concept approved by the Bulgarianparliament last April. Since Bulgaria is determined topromote and enhance the values of democracy  we arecertainly interested in ensuring that these values becomewidely accepted throughout South-Eastern Europe.The Republic of Bulgaria welcomes its inclusion in theprocess of enlargement of the European Union  togetherwith other associated countries of Central and EasternEurope and Cyprus. The Bulgarian Government is fullyaware that our accession aspirations are contingent on thesuccess of the domestic  economic and legislative reforms.It is against this background that a national strategy foraccession to the European Union  outlining the mainactivities of the country from a long-term perspective was adopted last March.The Bulgarian Government has developed a clear-cutnational strategy to meet the criteria for NATOmembership  based on a comprehensive nationalprogramme of preparation which is being constantlyupdated and optimized. Bulgaria has the political will andis undertaking concrete steps to fulfil in regional termsthe objectives of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Counciland the enhanced Partnership for Peace. Our positiveattitude is reflected in the ongoing regional politicaldialogue and the practical follow-up measures to enhanceregional security and defence cooperation in South-Eastern Europe.We consider multilateral confidence and security-building measures to be an important aspect of politicalcooperation in the region. An important example of thiscooperation is the initiative to create a multinational peaceforce in South-Eastern Europe. In the course of thenegotiations on this project  Bulgaria proposed hosting thejoint headquarters of the force in the Bulgarian city ofPlovdiv. The establishment of the force will strengthenthe spirit of confidence and cooperation in the region.Another key aspect of regional cooperation is theprocess of good-neighbourly relations  stability  securityand cooperation in South-Eastern Europe initiated at theMeeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of theCountries of South-Eastern Europe in Sofia in 1996.Annual ministerial meetings have been held since then  aswell as a number of specialized expert meetings devotedto issues of common interest in various fields  includingtransport  energy  transborder cooperation  combatingorganized crime and drug-trafficking.Closely linked to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security is the fight against terrorism andinternational crime. We condemn all terrorist acts andlament the loss of life and the destruction inflicted bythem. The most recent deplorable examples of such actswere the horrible bomb attacks in some African countries.We share the view that the threat of terrorism requires adecisive and joint response by the whole internationalcommunity. Bulgaria supports the activities of the UnitedNations aimed at setting norms and standards for the fightagainst terrorism and international crime through29negotiating various legal instruments and creating theappropriate institutions for this purpose.We consider that successfully combating terrorism andorganized crime in some countries cannot be achievedthrough the efforts of their Governments alone. It requiresthe effective involvement of other States  which have themeans and the experience in this field. Bulgaria fullysupports the recent initiative by France and Great Britain toconvene a high-level conference in London this autumnaimed at depriving terrorists of their support. We note withappreciation that on 18 July this year  the DiplomaticConference in Rome adopted the Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court. I would like to reiterate my country?sconfidence that the establishment in the foreseeable futureof the International Criminal Court will be an efficient steptowards deterring possible perpetrators from committingterrorist acts.The broadening of the human aspect of developmentthrough democracy and participation has been widelyaccepted and has become one of the priorities of UnitedNations activities. This year we celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsand the fifth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration andProgramme of Action. The principle of the indivisibility ofuniversally recognized civil  political  economic  social andcultural rights continues to be a key element of today?ssystem for the promotion and protection of human rightsand freedoms. The designation of 1998 as the InternationalYear for Human Rights could stimulate a furtherrestructuring of United Nations human rights activities strengthening the staff of and securing adequate financialresources for the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights. In this respect we wouldlike to commend the relevant measures taken by the HighCommissioner  Mrs. Mary Robinson  and to reiterate oursupport for her efforts to this end.Better implementation of international standards couldbe achieved by improving the existing mechanisms and byopen dialogue on most sensitive issues  including thoserelated to human rights in individual States. Accordingly the Bulgarian Government attaches great importance to theenjoyment of all human rights by Bulgarians living abroadand considers respect for their rights to be an essentialelement for the enhancement of bilateral relations.Bulgaria supports the ongoing process of reformpursued consistently by the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan and aimed at the streamlining and strengthening of theOrganization and at making it more efficient and responsiveto the new realities. One of the substantial issues ofoverall United Nations reform is the question ofrepresentation on and increase in the membership of theSecurity Council. Bulgaria reiterates its willingness tosupport such an enlargement of the Council  which couldguarantee its effectiveness and enhance its capacity tomaintain international peace and security. In our view theenlargement should envisage the preservation of thebalance between the permanent and non-permanentmembers  as well as among regional groups. As themembership of the Group of Eastern European States hasdoubled in the last decade  an additional non-permanentseat for this group should be secured. A decision on theenlargement of the Council and on its working methodsshould be supported by the broadest possible consensus including all the Council?s permanent members.Bulgaria attaches great importance to the activitiesof the United Nations in the field of sustainabledevelopment and is closely following the United Nationsdialogue and the activities of United Nations bodies andagencies on the issues of demography  socialdevelopment  women and narcotic drugs. The specialsession of the General Assembly on narcotic drugs  heldin June of this year  merits particular mention in thisregard. That session reflected the determination ofMember States to combine their efforts in the fightagainst drugs  and its results contributed to the commoneffort to achieve sustainable development.As a country with an economy in transition  Bulgariacooperates actively with the United Nations system ofspecialized agencies and programmes. Our interest is todevelop this cooperation further. We are looking forwardto more streamlined activities thanks to the potential ofthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) forcapacity-building and assistance in the development andexecution of joint projects. At the same time  the basicprinciples of universality and primary responsibility ofGovernments for the process should be preserved. In thisregard the system of resident coordinators and the effortto make this more operational will play an important role.Here I would like to express our satisfaction with theperformance of the UNDP office in Sofia.For Bulgaria  development and economic growth willbe impossible without full participation in worldeconomic and financial exchanges. In our opinion  theUnited Nations and its institutions could be more stronglyinvolved in the solution of the specific problems ofeconomic transition and reforms.Disarmament issues continue to have an importantplace in overall efforts to secure a better world for futuregenerations. We agree with the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  that disarmament is at the centre of our mission ofpeace and development  and we welcome his decision to re-establish the Department for Disarmament Affairs. TheBulgarian Government attaches high priority to internationalefforts to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime.We call for an early entry into force of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) as an important step inthat direction  and support the decision of the Conferenceon Disarmament to establish an ad hoc committee toconduct negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. Inthis context  we were deeply concerned by the nuclear testsconducted by India and by Pakistan earlier this year.Bulgaria has associated itself with statements by thepresidency of the European Union calling on India andPakistan to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) and to sign the CTBT  as well asto participate in negotiations on a fissile material cut-offtreaty with the aim of maintaining a strong global non-proliferation regime.We favour the strengthening of the Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production and Stockpilingof Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and onTheir Destruction  and believe that further acceleration ofthe negotiations and an early conclusion of the protocol tothe Convention is required.As a State party to the Convention on the Prohibitionof the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use ofChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction  Bulgariawould like to contribute to enlarging the number ofaccessions to the Convention in order to achieve recognitionof the prohibition of chemical weapons as a universal normof international law. As a concrete effort to this end Bulgaria will host a regional seminar on the issue later thismonth.With regard to conventional arms  anti-personnellandmines are widely recognized as a pernicious weaponwhich indiscriminately kills and maims hundreds ofthousands of people worldwide. Convinced of the needfor a total prohibition of anti-personnel mines  on 29 Julythis year the Bulgarian Parliament ratified the Conventionon the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction  thus contributing to its early entry into force.We are also ready to contribute to the efforts of theinternational community to reduce conventional weapons including small arms  and especially their excessive anddestabilizing accumulation in areas of conflict. We regarduniversal participation in the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms as an important step towards effectivetransparency  both on a regional and a global scale.In the context of the new challenges in the field ofinternational peace and security  United Nationspeacekeeping operations continue to be an essentialelement in the Organization?s activities. My countryappreciates the efforts of the Secretary-General to ensurewide support for these and to put in place the necessaryarrangements that will enable the United Nations todeploy peacekeeping forces rapidly and effectively inareas of conflict. We are convinced that the newgeneration of peacekeeping operations should include intheir mandates a proportional combination of political military  humanitarian  reconstruction and other relevantactivities. In this regard  we believe that there are stillunused opportunities to strengthen United Nationscooperation with regional organizations in the field ofpreventive diplomacy  crisis management andpeacekeeping.In conclusion  I would like once again to declare mycountry?s readiness to cooperate actively with all otherMember States in the successful implementation of thelofty goals of the present session of the GeneralAssembly. We are confident that our discussions on theimportant agenda items before us will be translated intopractical measures."
"18",724,"BHR",53,1998,"At the outset  I am pleased to extend toMr. Opertti my sincere congratulations on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession. I am confident that his experience and skill willhelp ensure that we achieve the best results possible inour proceedings this session.I should also like to take this opportunity to expressmy appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his5notable success in guiding the proceedings of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-second session. It am also pleased toexpress thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his unceasing efforts to reform theUnited Nations and to enhance its credibility whilestrengthening its role in maintaining world peace andsecurity.The aspirations of the world?s peoples and States toachieve stability based on security  peace  prosperity andadvancement  which are basic objectives of the internationalcommunity  impose upon us the duty  year after year  totake a realistic account  in this international forum  of theconfigurations of international realities for which the UnitedNations serves as the most credible gauge and the mostcomprehensive reference point for changes in various fields.This would enable us to assess together how close we areto  or how far we are from  our basic human objectives.Developments in recent months and weeks in variousparts of the world  and their implications and effects atdifferent international levels  have demonstrated that despite all the efforts made  this world is a long way fromachieving the stability desired. They also demonstrate thatno single Power  nation or bloc  however powerful orinfluential  can distance or protect itself from instability which is rampant in the world  unless situations in thenorth  south  east and west are approached in a unified consensual and fair manner and with balance andinterdependence. This must be done in order to radicallysolve problems and issues  addressing their root causes andavoiding double standards and partial or temporarysolutions  and without deferring seemingly chronicproblems that are bound to rear their heads again in oneform or another.The failure of the international community to takeproper advantage of the end of the cold war has been mademanifest by the nuclear arms race erupting in Asia obstacles in the Middle East peace process  the rise ofterrorism and other acts of violence committedindiscriminately in various parts of the world  as well as theworsening of economic crises in several regions.The international situation is once again precarious and it is incumbent upon all of us to treat these matterscomprehensively  and with greater firmness anddetermination. The increased gravity of the phenomenon ofterrorism on the one hand  and the divergence of viewsregarding that phenomenon on the other  underline the needfor greater international understanding and more effectivejoint coordination. This calls for the need to convene aninternational conference at the highest possible level tocombat terrorism  for it is illogical to condemn terrorismat one level  while giving haven to persons involved in itat another level. Such an enormous task cannot beundertaken by any single State or bloc alone  whateverresources it may have. Thus we are once again faced withan enormous and renewed responsibility placed on theshoulders of our international Organization  which hasnow been required  in the light of the new conditions andthe profound changes in the international environment  toadopt effective and unconventional working methods soas to confront these new and unprecedented situations inthe history of humankind.This bestows a renewed importance and should alsogive new impetus to both the United Nations reformprogramme put forward by the Secretary-General last yearand to approaches to reactivating the performance of theSecurity Council in line with more effective formulas forits restructuring and functioning which may be acceptableto the international community within the United Nations.These formulas should take into account equitablegeographical distribution and an appropriate increase inthe Council?s membership  commensurate with theincrease in the Organization?s membership. Bahrain takespride in the fact that at present it is the representative ofthe Asian Group in the Security Council.Experience has shown that the end of an era  orvictory in a confrontation  does not mean the end ofcrises or confrontations in the world  and that continuousinternational vigilance and permanent joint action areindispensable if we are to avoid inertia and prevent therecurrence of such crises. Creative visions and innovativemethods to deal with new challenges are required. Thatdoes not mean that we have reached the end of history  assome have imagined. Rather  it means that we havereached an unprecedented phase of history on thepractical and political plane of the international situation.Insofar as the theoretical and intellectual aspects areconcerned  it is a fact that — however numerous may bethe views and interpretations in research and discussionsin the world?s different cultures and civilizations that havecaptured the attention of the world in an unprecedentedmanner in respect of the “globalization” phenomenon andits dimensions and possible impacts  both positive andnegative — the United Nations  established over half acentury ago  remains the indisputable mother institutionfor this phenomenon. The United Nations represents anearly concretization of globalization in world history 6despite the fact that globalization was not then as mature orcomprehensive as it is today.If there is to be a global focal point qualified to carryout balanced and objective research on the dimensions ofthis phenomenon whose impact is yet to be agreed upon this international Organization should be the commonmelting pot for the various visions and diverginginterpretations concerning the globalization of theinternational scene  irrespective of the cultural  intellectualand spiritual directions of their proponents. This should alsobe achieved in a manner whereby the fashionable phrase“clash of civilizations” can be transcended and replaced byharmony and dialogue.Should the United Nations  with its institutions andintellect  be unable to absorb this international phenomenonand its consequences for human and international reality this may lead to a different global reality that isincompatible with the spirit and philosophy of theOrganization. The result of such a situation might in thelong run become difficult to contain and control within thebounds of international legitimacy and existing internationalcooperation  as attested to by the increase in acts ofterrorism and the breaches of established norms in morethan one field.It goes without saying that the United Nations will beunable to meet historical and future obligations of thismagnitude  without adequate support from all its MemberStates  whether at the level of financial obligations practical facilities or  more importantly  political support forits programmes and plans. In the final analysis  the UnitedNations is merely the sum total of the joint political will ofMember States. This sum total  be it positive or negative is but an expression of the capacity of that political will toundertake joint international action.In spite of the apprehensions and risks that loom overthe international horizon  the future for the third millenniumis laden with promises  hopes and potentials that are worthyof sacrifice and hard work for the sake of a better future.Accruing scientific and technological advancement  theincreasing speed of communications and the informationrevolution  the spread of free trade and the deepeninginteraction among nations  cultures and civilizations are allharbingers of a better world for all mankind.As it witnesses these positive new developments onthe world scene  Bahrain  with its deep-rooted civilization is hardly a stranger to this.Five thousand years ago  Bahrain was one of themost important commercial ports in the world. By virtueof its openness  based as it was on freedom of commerce it constituted a meeting place for cultures and humanthought. Since that early time  by symbolizing theheritage of the old world regarding coexistence andinteraction between human contributions  it becamequalified to be an island for peace and to be a civic andspiritual centre in its natural and human environment inthe Arabian Gulf. The existing legacy of its oldcivilization bears witness to that.Consequently  and since the beginning of its currentrenaissance  Bahrain has sought to meet the requirementsof modern advancement in the areas of administration andmanagement  educational and cultural enlightenment andthe creation of an open and civilized society that iscapable of evolution based primarily on the Bahrainiindividual?s innovation  capabilities and basic rights to afree and honourable life. It has thus become a model forbalanced modernization that preserves the traditions ofour region of the world.By virtue of this distinctive role  the State ofBahrain  small in size as it is  today bears a hefty regionaland international responsibility on three levelssimultaneously: first  in its capacity as the financial andbanking centre of one of the world?s most importanteconomic areas; secondly  in its capacity as a fundamentallink at the forefront of the joint defence strategy of thatvital region of the world — as has been the casecontinuously over the last half-century  coinciding withthe history of the United Nations; and thirdly  in itscapacity as a social  cultural and civic model that has since the beginning of this century  been open to modernthought and reforms and to progressive humandevelopment for both men and women equally in variousfields of education and work  and in responsible socialand national partnership. This has been reflected in thisyear?s United Nations Development Programme HumanDevelopment Report. That report placed Bahrain first inthe Arab world for the fourth consecutive year  for itsachievements in human development. Furthermore  theaccomplishments in the field of economic and industrialdevelopment in Bahrain reflect model diversification ofthe means of production  which goes beyond an exclusivedependence on oil.As it takes part in the United Nations celebrationsmarking the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  Bahrain in fact does so asa reflection of its real and historic contribution to the7building of the social  educational and developmentalfoundations for these basic human rights — the very coreof the general structure of society — in a manner thattranscends slogans and efforts to politicize this venerablehuman issue. In addressing this issue  due considerationshould be given to the historical and legislative peculiaritiesand values of every society  religion and culture  so that theoutlook of one system cannot predominate over thelegitimate and unique outlook of another.The United Nations played a positive role in defusingthe crisis between Iraq and the international inspectionteams earlier this year. The State of Bahrain welcomed theMemorandum of Understanding reached between theSecretary-General and the Iraqi Government. In view of ourkeen interest in the preservation of security and peace inthe Gulf region  we applaud the effective role undertakenby the Secretary-General in defusing the crisis and sparingthe region from dangerous ramifications and consequences.We wish to reaffirm the need for Iraq to continue fulfillingits international obligations concerning the elimination ofweapons of mass destruction and the release of Kuwaiti andother prisoners of war and detainees. Any progress in thisrespect should be recognized as a first step towards thealleviation of the suffering of the brotherly Iraqi people.The State of Bahrain has always emphasized the need forensuring the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and therejection of any interference in its internal affairs.The continued occupation by the Islamic Republic ofIran of the three islands of Abu Musa  Greater Tunb andLesser Tunb  which belong to the United Arab Emirates remains a cause of concern to the State of Bahrain and theother sister members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Wehope that ongoing contacts between the sisterly United ArabEmirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran will lead to thesettlement of the question of these islands by means ofserious bilateral negotiations and other available peacefulmeans for the settlement of disputes among States throughreconciliation.As far as the general situation in the Gulf isconcerned  we  of course  welcome the easing of tensionand the progress toward rapprochement and dialoguebetween the States members of the Gulf CooperationCouncil and the Islamic Republic of Iran as being in theinterest of all their peoples and of the preservation of peacein that region.The painful events in the Gulf region during the lasttwo decades explain why the question of regional securityremains one to which the State of Bahrain accords theutmost importance in view of its serious ramifications andrepercussions in relation to the security  stability andsafety of the States and peoples of the region. Theterritorial and boundary claims currently seen in the Gulfregion  which aim at changing established andtraditionally accepted boundaries  upset the security andstability of the region. In our view  the optimal and mostjudicious course for avoiding that scenario is to respectthe status quo  to refrain from all claims  total or partial and to settle any related differences by peaceful meansacceptable to the parties to the dispute. The establishmentof relations among the States of the region on the basis ofgood-neighbourliness  mutual respect  non-interference inthe internal affairs of others and recognition of everyState?s national sovereignty are also fundamental elementsfor the maintenance of security and stability in the region.Regarding the Middle East peace process  this yearhas not witnessed any positive developments or progress despite all the efforts to move the process forward. Webelieve that the lack of progress in the peace process willlead to an escalation of tension  extremism and violencein the region. Having supported the peace process sinceits very beginnings at the Madrid Conference as astrategic option for the achievement of a just comprehensive and lasting peace in the region  Bahrain isdeeply concerned at the stalemate in the peace processresulting from the Israeli Government?s insistence onfollowing policies of procrastination  non-compliance withcommitments previously agreed upon with the PalestinianAuthority  and construction of more settlements both inHoly Jerusalem and in the Syrian Golan. That is inaddition to the continued confiscation of land in theoccupied Palestinian territories. Therefore  we call uponthe international community  and in particular the two co-sponsors of the peace process  to intensify efforts torescue the faltering process  prevent its failure and put itback on the right course on all tracks so that just andcomprehensive peace may be attained on the basis of theprinciple of land for peace  the return to their owners ofthe Palestinian territories  including in the first place HolyJerusalem  recognition of the right of the Palestinianpeople to establish an independent State of its own on itsnational territory  complete withdrawal by Israel from theoccupied Syrian Arab Golan to the borders that existed on4 June 1967  in accordance with Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973)  and the unconditionalwithdrawal from occupied southern Lebanon inaccordance with Council resolution 425 (1978).With regard to the question of disarmament relevantto weapons of mass destruction  it should be recalled that8Israel continues to avoid accession to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and a commitmentto end a nuclear arms race in the region. Such a position isapt to force other States to enter such a race  as hashappened in South Asia  and as could happen anywhere inthe world.This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the world?smultilateral trading system. Since the system wasestablished  numerous rounds of multilateral tradenegotiations contributed to the creation of the World TradeOrganization. We hope that the forthcoming round of tradenegotiations  expected to begin before the end of thecentury  will lead to the creation of an environmentconducive to the development and diversification of worldtrade  and to the enhancement of economic and commercialcooperation among States on the basis of equality andreciprocal benefits.The financial crisis that has afflicted a number ofStates and regions has caused economic tremors and hasvisibly affected the economies of numerous States  thusaffirming the interdependence of the world economicsystem. In view of the consequences of this crisis  theinternational community must pay special attention to thetreatment of economic factors that have a bearing on worldgrowth rates and find effective solutions to them.It is our view that dialogue and cooperation betweenStates of the North and of the South with a view toaddressing world economic conditions would enhance worldeconomic stability  lead to a greater flow of financialresources for development purposes and solve problemsrelated to indebtedness  transfer of technology and thepromotion of international investment.Environmental issues constitute a challenge that willface mankind during the twenty-first century. Concertedinternational efforts will be called for to address andprevent the dangers related to that challenge. Accordingly the State of Bahrain has endorsed the Protocol adopted bythe third session of the Conference of the Parties to theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held last December at Kyoto  Japan. We look forward tothe fulfilment by the developed countries of theirobligations under that Protocol.On the threshold of the twenty-first century  we viewassertion of the importance of one civilization at theexpense of others as incongruous at the dawning of a newera  an era based on peaceful coexistence betweencivilizations  their integration  their mutual enrichment  andtheir interaction with one another on an equal footing.The experience of the United Nations since itsestablishment has shown that variety and diversity ofcultures are means towards fusion and harmony ratherthan towards antagonism and divisiveness. Therefore  it isincumbent upon us  during the forthcoming period  tobuild relations among all nations  peoples  States andcultures on the basis of cooperation  consensus andunderstanding  rather than confrontation  hegemony orcollision. Let us together promote close and enduring tiesamong peoples and cultures in a world of interdependenceand fraternity. Let national and cultural pluralism beelements of fruitful solidarity and mutual understandingin the creation of an era of peace and tranquillity.This Organization  which over the last 50 years hasguided mankind towards better understanding and greatercooperation and coordination  is capable of pursuing itshistoric role and undertaking a positive role in theongoing evolution of the international communitythroughout the next century. It is thus no exaggeration tosay that the world has never before witnessed as historica juncture as this  where it needs a joint internationalvision and concerted international action with a view tocrossing to the shore of safety for which we all yearn."
"19",762,"BHS",53,1998,"I wish to express thepleasure of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas at havingMr. Opertti preside over the deliberations of this fifty-third session of the General Assembly and to convey tohim our warmest congratulations on his election. He maycount on the full support of the Bahamas delegation toensure the success of this session.The Bahamas also wishes to express its appreciationto Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine  whose competentleadership brought the deliberations of the fifty-secondsession to a successful conclusion. He has our gratitude.On 10 July of this year  the Commonwealth of theBahamas celebrated its silver jubilee anniversary as asovereign nation. Our country is a thriving democracy andenjoys one of the highest standards of living in ourhemisphere. Our economy continues its rebound fromnegative growth early in the decade  and increasingly weare creating the jobs necessary to provide productiveemployment for our young population in all sectors of theBahamian economy.Over the past 25 years  the Bahamas hasdemonstrated a consistently strong and exemplary recordin upholding democracy  protecting and promoting humanrights  promoting the advancement of women andpromoting social development and justice.As a member of the community of nations  theBahamas has remained firm in its commitments to theUnited Nations and to other international organizations.Hence  the foreign policy of the Bahamas has beenmarked by peaceful cooperation and respect for thesovereignty of its neighbours.Nevertheless  we  like many others in theinternational community  are constrained to question theadequacy of delivery on commitments to improve thecircumstances of developing countries. I believe it is fairto assert that the United Nations record of achievement indeveloping countries has been  at best  mixed.While it is true that many developing countries havegained a measure of success in their economic and socialsectors as a direct result of United Nations interventionand assistance  too often such successes have beenovershadowed and continue to be overshadowed by8serious deficiencies. Too many countries in the developingworld today suffer from abject poverty  deterioratingenvironments  poor health standards  high unemploymentrates  staggering levels of malnutrition and hunger spiralling inflation  growing criminal activity and masses ofhomeless persons displaced by political and economicconditions. Such problems and challenges defy the meagreresources  both human and financial  of these nations  andmany assistance programmes mounted to redress them arelimited by their decreasing resources.These are some of the critical areas where theOrganization can make a difference in the lives ofindividuals  especially in developing countries. Another areawhere the Organization could make a difference would bein the adoption of measures to eradicate the abhorrentpractice of trafficking in women and children. We call uponthe international community to make every effort to addressthis problem in a comprehensive manner.The Bahamas continues to be challenged by theuncontrolled entry of economic migrants to its territory  astruggle which receives scant international recognition orassistance  notwithstanding the considerable financialburden foisted upon our small developing State. Indeed undue pressure is frequently brought to bear upon our smallsociety to absorb such economic refugees without regardfor the serious social and political consequences of suchrequests. It is clear that the important United Nationsconventions crafted to address the problems of politicalrefugees following the Second World War do notadequately address the problem of today?s undocumentedeconomic migrants. We call on this Assembly  therefore  tobegin to address the need for a review of the mandate ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.The Bahamas is an archipelago of some 700 islandsstretched over some 80 000 square miles of ocean. We arehome to one of the most important coral reef systems in theworld and of important species of flora  fauna and animallife  both terrestrial and marine. Our responsibility toconserve and protect our environment for the welfare offuture generations is clear. Equally clear is the fact that werequire continued international assistance if we are tosucceed. In this regard  I wish to acknowledge and thankthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNDP) for itscontinuing assistance to the Bahamas as we seek to enhanceour capacity to catalogue  manage and protect our richbiodiversity; and to thank also the Secretariat of the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change for itsassistance in improving our response to the challengescreated by climate change and sea level rise.It is important that we begin to deal forthrightly withthe obstacles which impede the United Nations fromplaying as effective a role as it ought  or might  in theglobal economy. We must be vigilant against slippage inour commitment to the goals of the Organization soeloquently embodied in our fiftieth anniversary pledge tobe a people “united for a better world“ in which thehuman condition remained our highest priority. We mustall accept that the United Nations can only be  and willonly be  as successful and responsive as we the MemberStates allow it to be. The United Nations success is oursuccess.The reform measures adopted last session provide auseful platform from which to refocus and improve ourOrganization. In this regard  the Bahamas welcomes theproposals for both a Millennium Assembly and aMillennium Forum  so as to forge a closer partnershipwith civil society.The Bahamas also recognizes and accepts theappropriateness of adopting sunset clauses  establishingtime limits for United Nations mandates. Given thesensitivity of the matter  however  we stronglyrecommend that final decisions be arrived at on the basisof consensus among the Organization?s membership.The Bahamas believes that the Security Council ascurrently composed reflects some inequities andimbalances of this Organization. A living organizationmust adapt to changing circumstances if it is to remainrelevant. A Security Council reflecting the eminence ofpost-Second World War Powers cannot be expected toadequately address concerns of our post-colonial world.As we approach a new millennium  it would be in ourinterest for this central organ of our Organization to bemore reflective of our present reality.As a peace-loving nation  and one in which respectfor human dignity has historically been upheld  theBahamas condemns terrorism in all its forms. Suchwanton acts are inhumane and wreak havoc on entirecommunities. It is for these reasons that the Bahamas willcontinue to lend its support to all legitimate national andinternational efforts to stem the spread of terrorism and towork towards its elimination.To this end  we will continue to cooperate with theinternational community to bring the perpetrators ofterrorism to justice  as well as to address comprehensivelythe root causes of terrorism. We call on all Members toact similarly.9We wish to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan forhis untiring efforts in the promotion of international peaceand security. Unfortunately  his recent reports on troublespots around the world continue to reveal a disturbingpicture. In a world shrunken by globalization  every troublespot has the potential to affect us all. Our energies  exertedin search of real solutions to these global crises  musttherefore match those expended in pursuit of responses toour national challenges. Let us seek to mark the fiftiethanniversary of United Nations peacekeeping with anenlightened breakthrough in this area.The continued production and use of land minesinternationally continues to maim and kill thousands ofinnocent men  women and children in developing countries.The Bahamas abhors these actions. We were pleased to jointhe more than 100 countries which have signed theConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction  which we have also now ratified. Wecall upon all Member States that have not done so  to dothe same.The Bahamas is seriously concerned by theproliferation of handguns and other weapons whichcontinue to infiltrate small island developing States. Theuse of these conventional weapons by perpetrators of crimeconsiderably raises the level of violence in our societies andthreatens our social  economic and political fibre.We call on countries manufacturing handgun and otherweapons to assume greater responsibility over the sale andexport of such weapons  and to strengthen theirinternational collaborative efforts to combat this problem.For our part  we have joined Member States of thishemisphere in acceding to and ratifying the Inter-AmericanConvention against the Illicit Manufacturing of andTrafficking in Firearms  Ammunition  Explosives and OtherRelated Materials. We commend similar action to allMember States of this body.The Bahamas  after experiencing an abatement in theillicit transit and traffic in narcotic drugs through itsterritory  regrets to inform the Assembly that it is againconfronted with this scourge. Drug seizure quantity andfrequency have increased  and the numbers of personsarrested and charged with drug offences are similarlyincreasing. Past experience has taught us that this is not aproblem which can be resolved by any single State.International cooperation is critical if this menace is to becontrolled.Notably  we welcomed the recent twentieth specialsession of the General Assembly on the world?s drugproblem. That session adopted important decisionsdesigned to chart the future course in the internationalfight to combat the supply  traffic and consumption ofillicit drugs. It is now imperative that Member Statescommit themselves to the implementation of thosedecisions.The past 12 months have been a period of turmoilfor the world?s economy  marked in particular by thecrippling financial crisis in South-East Asia. The falloutfrom that crisis is now being felt  in varying degrees globally.We have  from time to time  in this forumunderscored the importance of establishing a sustainableand equitable international framework for highlyintegrated global markets. This need remains critical particularly in the light of the quickening pace of theglobalization of production and of capital flows  and theliberalization of trade since early in this decade. Clearly these developments have not provided equal opportunitiesfor all countries to share in the benefits of globalization.Countries — developing countries  least developedcountries and countries with economies in transition —ought to be assisted in their efforts to become integratedinto the mainstream global economy  without incurringdisruptive and punitive economic  social and culturalcosts. These are matters of survival for small economieslike that of the Bahamas.Questions are now being raised concerning theadequacy of the international financial system to meet thegrowing demands of the world?s diverse economies. MyGovernment is acutely aware that  while private capitalflows have played an indispensable role in theadvancement of developing economies  they should not berelied upon as the single source of financing for capitaldevelopment. In this connection  the Bahamas notes therecent call for a high-level international intergovernmentalforum on financing for development aimed at furtheringthe global partnership for development.My Government supports this call and applauds theAssembly?s efforts to explore the matter further bysoliciting input from Member States. We call on this bodyto address the issue in as comprehensive and integrated amanner as possible.10My Government was also pleased to note theconvening  in December last  of the expert group meetingon vulnerability indices here at the United Nations. It is myGovernment?s fervent hope that work will continue in thisimportant area. As the Assembly is aware  the Bahamas hason many occasions repeated its objection to the use of percapita income as the sole  or principal  measuring tool forthe economies of developing countries. This yardstick doesnot  and cannot  take into account the special circumstancesof countries like the Bahamas  with our archipelagic make-up  our ecological fragility and our economic vulnerability.Yet these are all integral measures of our state ofdevelopment.My Government looks forward to the upcomingreview in 1999 of the Barbados Programme of Action  andhopes that all issues of concern to small island developingStates will be addressed in line with the chapters of theProgramme of Action.The vision of our United Nations to meet the needs ofour people is achievable  but only if our purposes andprinciples are designed for the common good rather thanfor narrow nationalistic objectives. Otherwise  such motiveswill inevitably produce inadequate programmes andadversely affect relationships.The lessons of history no longer take centuries to bededuced. They present themselves starkly before us  oftenin our own lifetime. Will we choose to learn from them?The answer lies with each of us."
"20",787,"BIH",53,1998,"It is myprivilege and honour to address the fifty-third session ofthe General Assembly on behalf of Bosnia andHerzegovina.12At the outset I would like to congratulate Mr. DidierOpertti on his election as President. His well-known skillsand experience in international affairs guarantee the wiseconduct of this session. Our gratitude goes to the outgoingPresident  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine.Just a few days ago the outcome of the recent generalelections in Bosnia and Herzegovina was made public. Weare satisfied with the fact that those important elections conducted under the auspices of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  passedpractically without incident or disruption. According to thegeneral assessment by the international and local monitors we had free and fair elections.A new chapter in the political life of Bosnia andHerzegovina is about to begin. The new Parliament and thenew Council of Ministers will have to address withoutdelay a number of issues of vital importance for ourcountry. Indeed  at stake is the destiny of a country with aparticular internal structure: three constitutive peoples  twoentities and one internationally recognized State. Onlythrough scrupulous respect for equal rights and adequateparticipation in power by the parties in Bosnia andHerzegovina can we achieve the goal  which has nocredible alternative: a modern State based on the rule oflaw  parliamentary democracy  respect for human rights anda market economy. This will also open the door forintegration into European and transatlantic institutions. Themost encouraging sign in this direction was the recentDeclaration of support by the European Union and theestablishment of its Joint Task Force with Bosnia andHerzegovina.It is obvious that we in Bosnia and Herzegovinacannot do this alone. We must prove to our friends andsupporters from around the world that we can be a reliable responsible partner in this joint project  which in the endshould place Bosnia and Herzegovina in the family ofdemocratic States. But it also must be remembered that inevitably  those in Bosnia and Herzegovina who behavedifferently or against the rules will not be allowed toparticipate in this endeavour of crucial importance.The question about the future of my country is beingasked in many quarters of the world. The same question but certainly with an additional existential and emotionalcharge  is in the air in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself.There are no easy answers in Bosnia and Herzegovina.However  since we are talking here about the future of avery specific country  the possible answer is at the sametime both simple and complicated. It is simple because ofthe fact that whoever holds public office in Bosnia andHerzegovina is obliged to implement the provisions of theDayton Agreement fully and unconditionally. On the otherhand  it is complicated because it will  to a large extent depend on good political will  a sense of historicalresponsibility and the determination of each player in thecomplex State structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina to doso.Almost three years after the signing of the PeaceAgreement  the consolidation of peace and thereconstruction process in Bosnia and Herzegovina isentering a new stage. From the very beginning  themilitary component was implemented well and anenvironment of overall security was created. Thus  wewere able to focus our energy on the civilian aspects ofthe Agreement  which proved to be extremely complex.We went through the rough waters of various obstacles mistrust  misunderstanding and obstruction. But it wasalso a time of the first signs of confidence-building andthe establishment of the necessary foundation for ahealthy partnership.In spite of the often justified criticism regarding thepace of progress  one must recall some of the importantpositive steps that have been made: one flag  a commoncurrency  common license plates  common passports generally improved freedom of movement and significantreconstruction results. On the other hand  the return ofrefugees and displaced persons to their homes of origin the proper functioning of State institutions  anindependent judicial system  and the uniform protectionof human rights still represent major problems in Bosniaand Herzegovina.Therefore  with the elections behind us  the renewedpolitical resolve and energy must be applied to finding asolution to all the aforementioned issues. A multi-ethnic multicultural Bosnia and Herzegovina within both itsentities  in which mutual respect  equality and cooperationamong the constitutive peoples and different ethnic groupsare shared assets  will be the best answer to superficialtheories on the inevitable clashes between differentcultures and civilizations.The continued presence of the internationalcommunity in Bosnia and Herzegovina is certainlyneeded. Without the generous help and support it has13extended so far  little would have been achieved. TheUnited Nations and its specialized agencies stand highamong those that are doing their best to help Bosnia andHerzegovina overcome its problems. But the time has cometo consider that one future path may lie in changing thedonor-recipient relationship into a concrete  project-orientedjoint venture  in which local companies and infrastructurecould have a more substantial participation.This would no doubt contribute to the faster economicrehabilitation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to reachingthe level of self-sustainable growth. Better economicprospects will certainly enhance our ability to overcomemany existing obstacles and to achieve the overall stabilityof the country; and the ultimate goal of handing over thebusiness of running the country to the citizens of Bosniaand Herzegovina would be better served.At a more global level  this is the way for Bosnia andHerzegovina to become a factor for stability in the regionand an active partner in building security architecture on thecontinent. As has already been mentioned  we in Bosniaand Herzegovina cannot do this alone. But  hand in handwith the international community  we can all continue ourjourney into the next millennium with more hope and betterprospects.In less than two years  the century — full ofachievements and unbelievable technological progress  butalso a period of two world wars and a number of smallerbut no less tragic conflicts — will be over. We are steppinginto a new millennium with a lot of expectations  but alsowith heavy baggage.Here  I would be morally and politically reckless if Idid not highlight the tragic and increasingly alarmingsituation in the Kosovo region of the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia. Events there certainly have a contaminatingeffect on Bosnia and Herzegovina  at least psychologically.However  the situation is in itself worthy of our greatconsideration and engagement  regardless of its impact onBosnia and Herzegovina or beyond.Lessons must have been learned from the internationaltreatment Bosnia and Herzegovina received during ourrecent crisis. Decisiveness  urgency and the propercombination of tools and remedies available to the keyfactors must all be there in order for us to achieve a speedyand proper solution. The human  national and democraticrights of all the parties must be taken into consideration  asmust the territorial integrity of all States in the region. Nomatter how we get there  all lasting solutions end with apolitical settlement — one which all the parties need toabide by  if not always enthusiastically support. We arethere to help in any way we can and the active support ofus all will be necessary.Bosnia and Herzegovina  on the other hand  has triedto learn from its recent past. When you have to pay ahigh price for a lesson  you also learn well. Among othersteps  Bosnia and Herzegovina has ratified the Conventionon the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction. We now need to continue our efforts todecontaminate the ground  and the assistance of theinternational community is also essential in thisendeavour.Bosnia and Herzegovina’s experience was alsocritical to the recent adoption of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court in Rome. We played a vitaland active role in Rome  since we are convinced thatjustice and reconciliation  legality and peace  areintertwined. The new Court should take into considerationthe experiences of the International Tribunal for theformer Yugoslavia  whose impact on lasting peace inBosnia and Herzegovina is critical.We in Bosnia and Herzegovina are convinced thatthose responsible for serious violations of internationalhumanitarian law should be brought to justice  regardlessof the ethnicity of the victims or perpetrators. We have adirect and decisive interest in securing compliance by allsignatories  and all others who are obligated  with all theircommitments under the peace Agreement  including fullcompliance with the International Tribunal.One thing we can be proud of is our universalOrganization  the United Nations  which  throughout thistime  has been the main vehicle for promoting peace cooperation and development on our planet. In the face ofnew challenges  we would like to see the United Nationseven more efficient and instrumental in dealing with anumber of global issues.The struggle against terrorism  illegal arms and drug-trafficking and violations of human rights is in theforefront of our common agenda for a better future. Therole of a dynamic  effective  well-focused United Nationsis indispensable in that respect.This year  we are also celebrating the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. Thanks to that document and to the tireless14activities of people around the world  human rights havebecome a genuine global issue  and ensuring their respectand protection is one of the most important ongoing tasksof the international community.The end of this millennium in human history haswitnessed a growing number of massive humanitarianemergencies. We need to draw conclusions from thembecause the flagrant violation of human rights andhumanitarian law and the barbaric acts of savagery that wehave witnessed in various parts of the globe in recent yearsare an affront to our common humanity.Based on our own experience in Bosnia andHerzegovina  we have learned lessons that we must sharewith the international community as a part of ourhumanitarian duty. We owe it to ourselves and to ourchildren. That is why my Government intends to proposefor the favourable consideration of this Assembly a set ofbasic tenets of humanitarian action in emergency situations.The purpose is neither to duplicate nor to downgrade theongoing efforts  but rather to supplement what exists and toenhance awareness of the need to adjust international normsand practices to new realities. We trust that all MemberStates will join us in this effort so that  together  we areable to contribute to the development of a new internationalhumanitarian order."
"21",834,"BLR",53,1998,"Please accept our sincerecongratulations  Sir  on the occasion of your election topreside over the fifty-third session  as well as our wishesfor success in realizing the goals and principles of theUnited Nations.We welcome all the efforts of the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for the benefit of the Organization andits Member States  and sincerely wish him further successon his way  which is strewn not with roses alone.With appropriate respect and great appreciation forthe activities of the President of the General Assembly atits fifty-second session  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko ofUkraine  we wish him important achievements in hisactivities as a Member of Parliament in his nativecountry.Today  on the very threshold of the thirdmillennium  it becomes clear for the majority of MemberStates that the time has come to take comprehensivemeasures for everyone to turn the determination of thepeoples of the United Nations  declared in its Charter into reality “to save succeeding generations from thescourge of war ... to practice tolerance and live togetherin peace with one another as good neighbours”. In fact that was the ultimate goal behind all the diverse activitiesof the United Nations in the years after its Charter cameinto force in 1945.The world goes through non-stop change. Today theglobal environment in which Member States cooperate toachieve the goals of the Charter is different from that ofhalf a century ago. United Nations activities should reflectmore adequately those sweeping changes of the secondhalf of the twentieth century  many of which shattered theworld.The Government of the Republic of Belarus hasbeen persistent and consistent in its efforts to promotepeace  friendship  good-neighbourly relations andmutually beneficial cooperation. This policy is enshrinedin the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus  chapter 18of which  in particular  declares:“In its foreign policy the Republic of Belarusproceeds from the principles of the equality ofStates  non-use of force or the threat to use force inviolability of frontiers  peaceful settlement ofdisputes  non-interference in internal affairs of Statesand other universally acknowledged principles andstandards of international law.“The Republic of Belarus pledges itself tomake its territory a neutral  nuclear-weapon-freeState.”30Thus the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus isconsistent with all our obligations under the United NationsCharter and other instruments of international law to whichBelarus is a party.The United Nations is to define far-reaching goals andguidelines for international cooperation into the twenty-firstcentury. Everybody wants to be better off  to have theopportunity to work and live in peace and freedom. Thereis a need for the United Nations to elaborate an effectivelegislative  economic  social and political framework to givehumankind an opportunity to realize these legitimateaspirations in an environment much more favourable thanthe one we have had in the century that draws to its close.Most global problems are persistent  hard to resolveand resist old approaches. We should seek new solutionsand reach agreements to do away with the problems inunconventional  innovative ways. I believe that theproposed reform of the United Nations will give us a goodopportunity to achieve this. Our attitude to the reform wasdefined in the letter of the President of the Republic ofBelarus  His Excellency Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka  to theSecretary-General. We must ensure that reforming theactivities of the United Nations does not disrupt theattainment of its goals and the implementation of itsprinciples or derogate the interests of Member States andregional groups. Reforms should not mean disorganization.Reforms should mean the synergy of the best UnitedNations achievements in all areas of its activities  whichhave been developed for more than half a century. Webelieve in the ability of the Secretary-General and his staffto lead our Organization exactly in the required direction.On its part  the Republic of Belarus will do its utmostto contribute in all ways possible to the enhancement of theefficiency of the United Nations and its specializedagencies  and will seek generally acceptable agreements onall the issues of the global agenda. Strengthening the UnitedNations system and reforming the Security Council on thebasis of just and balanced representation of the regionalgroups would be most instrumental in this respect. Togetherwith other East European States  in particular members ofthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  Belarushas been an active initial proponent of the demand toallocate an additional non-permanent seat to that groupin the expanded Security Council.People all over the world and the internationalcommunity as a whole can no longer tolerate the killing ofhuman beings in inter-State and intra-State armed conflicts.During the years after the Second World War thousandsupon thousands  if not millions of people  have beenkilled. Nevertheless  hostilities continue in differentregions of the globe. Conflicts in Africa  the Middle Eastand the Balkans stay unresolved; still unsettled aresituations in Cyprus and other regions. In thesetremendously difficult circumstances the United Nationsis continuing to fulfil its responsibility with dignity. Yetthere is ample room for further improvement.We consider that the principles of the peacefulsettlement of disputes and non-interference in internalaffairs should be strictly observed while bringing aboutreconciliation in regional and domestic conflicts. Anyenforcement measures should only be applied followingthe adoption of a Security Council resolution.Accordingly  the use of force by individual States orregional organizations at their own discretion should notbe permissible. One of the objectives stipulated in theUnited Nations Charter  in the preamble  is “to ensure  bythe acceptance of principles and the institution ofmethods  that armed force shall not be used  save in thecommon interest”.It is difficult for the Government and people of theRepublic of Belarus to comprehend why in certainquarters the idea of a military attack on the sovereignState of Yugoslavia is being publicly discussed justbecause the latter decided to solve its domestic problems though really complicated  in its own way and would notrubber-stamp recipes enforced from outside. It is alsotime that Yugoslavia?s full membership of the UnitedNations be resumed. The mere threat of the use of forcecould seriously disrupt peace and stability in Europe revive old fears and animosities and generate moredistrust.The very serious problems that humanity faces todaycan be solved by reason and joint actions  rather than byforce. Paradoxically  despite the ever growing industrialand economic output in the world  the number of peopleliving below the poverty line is not diminishing. Moreand more people are becoming refugees or displacedpersons. Humanism  justice  fairness and respect forhuman rights have not become universal. Terrorism organized crime and illegal drug trafficking have not beenovercome  and even tend to grow. We share theSecretary-General?s view that the forces of globalization“pose extraordinary opportunities  as well as enormouschallenges”. (A/53/1  para. 229) The recent financialcrisis in many parts of the world is one of the latest andclearest manifestations of that.31Ecological interdependence has not yet become amatter of common awareness  as evidenced  in particular by the attitude to efforts to mitigate the after-effects of theChernobyl disaster. Belarus  which absorbed 70 per cent ofall the radioactive Chernobyl fallout  spends one fifth of itsbudget annually to eliminate the consequences of theChernobyl catastrophe. We are grateful for all internationalassistance  particularly in the rehabilitation of children. Atthe same time  the United Nations has prepared the inter-agency programme of international assistance to areasaffected by the Chernobyl disaster  in order to reviveinternational interaction for Chernobyl programmes andmake it more purposeful and effective. Furthermore  theUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of HumanitarianAffairs has organized two international special donormeetings to raise funds for the implementation of thisprogramme  estimated at $74 million. Yet the results ofthose meetings appear modest so far and demonstrate adisappointing deficit of international solidarity with theaffected countries in solving their problems.Given the global dimensions and implications of thedisaster  I would like to take this opportunity to again callon the donor countries  international organizations and non-governmental organizations to consider every possibility oftheir participation in financing the implementation of theprogramme.It is common knowledge that Belarus took anunprecedented step in post-world-war history by voluntarilyand unconditionally renouncing the nuclear arsenal in itspossession. Ukraine and Kazakhstan undertook similarmeasures  but at a later stage. These initiatives receivedunanimous high international appreciation  as confirmed byrelevant United Nations resolutions  and were also endorsedby North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) memberStates  which explicitly welcomed the step. The latterspecifically voiced  through NATO?s Secretary-General  itssupport of the goal shared by Belarus to “establish acommon security system that would meet the interests of allStates”. At first  it seemed that there was a will to legallyconsolidate a newly emerging international security systemand to promote disarmament  non-proliferation and the non-use of nuclear weapons. Those aspirations  however  haveyet to be realized.According to the United Nations DisarmamentCommission  nuclear-weapon-free zones at present covermore than half of the Earth?s surface  with an aggregatemembership of 144 countries. Yet there is still resistance tothe creation of new nuclear-weapon-free zones  in thesouthern hemisphere as well as the northern hemisphere.Therefore  the Belarus initiative of retaining a nuclear-weapon-free status quo in Central and Eastern Europe isalso stalled. The emergence of new nuclear-capablecountries also affected the situation with regard to theexisting nuclear-weapon-free zones  whose members haveyet to win the acknowledgement of their nuclear-weapon-free status by the nuclear States. Moreover  there are noguarantees that other “threshold” States will not expressin the future their intention to join the “nuclear club”. Weurge those Member States which have not yet done so toaccede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT). We would also welcome progress in therespective activities of the Conference on Disarmamentand the United Nations Disarmament Commission.In view of the above  a more constructive approachto the issue of disarmament and arms limitation  interalia  in the nuclear field  is called for. The reduction ofnuclear stockpiles currently under way in the UnitedStates and Russia is to be complemented by similarefforts by other holders of nuclear weapons  so as tojointly facilitate the complete disbanding of nuclear andother means of mass destruction. It is the ultimateobjective. To attain it  a number of specific prerequisitesmust be created.I would like to refer in particular to the statement ofthe NATO ministerial meeting on 10 December 1996 confirmed by the NATO heads of State or Government inthe Founding Act on Mutual Relations  Cooperation andSecurity between the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationand the Russian Federation of 27 May 1997  whichmaintains that “the NATO States have no intention  planor reason to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory ofthe new members.” We believe that that statement byNATO deserves approval by a General Assemblyresolution.I should also mention the 1996 StockholmDeclaration of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly which contains a reference to the decision of the 1995NPT Review and Extension Conference that “theestablishment of additional nuclear-weapon-free zones bythe time of the Review Conference in the year 2000would be welcome.” (NPT/Conf.1995/32  Part I  Decision2  para. 6)With due regard to that  we cannot accept theargument that it is premature to discuss and implementthe initiative to create a nuclear-weapon-free space in32Central and Eastern Europe at this juncture  and that itmight only be addressed in the distant future. Inspired bynew partnerships  we cannot possibly let the existing defacto nuclear-weapon-free status of Central and EasternEurope evaporate. We are convinced that the establishmentof a nuclear-weapon-free space in Europe wouldconstructively contribute to the shaping of a new Europeansecurity architecture aspired to by all the OSCE MemberStates.The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights is widely celebrated this year throughoutthe world. The provisions of the Declaration and otherinternational instruments on human rights  to which Belarusis a dutiful party  are reflected in the Constitution and otherlegislation of my country and are strictly implemented atthe State level  proceeding from the indivisibility andinterdependency of civil rights and obligations.Much has been done in Belarus to highlight the UnitedNations efforts to promote and protect human rights. TheUniversal Declaration of Human Rights was reprinted andwidely circulated. The National Assembly heldparliamentary hearings devoted to human rights. It shouldbe noted here that the hearings were broadcast live onBelorussian radio in their entirety. Other undertakings areenvisaged  including preparations to introduce the institutionof Ombudsman in Belarus. All these efforts are aimed  tocite the United Nations Charter  at promoting “socialprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom”. Therepresentatives of Belarus will give a detailed account ofthese matters during the discussion of relevant issues on theagenda.At the same time  we share the position of otherMember States that there is an ever pressing need toobserve the United Nations Charter and declarations basedthereon concerning non-interference in the internal affairsof States and the protection of their independence andsovereignty. The same is true of the principles ofinternational law referring to friendly relations andcooperation between States.I would like to pay special tribute to the positiveexperience Belarus has gained in cooperating with UnitedNations bodies. We greatly appreciate the role andimportance of the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) in our country regarding human resourcesdevelopment  strengthening the potential of Statemanagement  restructuring industries and creating civilsociety.We hope for a broadening of the United Nationsprogramme activities related to solving the problemsfaced by the Republic of Belarus and other countries witheconomies in transition.Our people live in a non-violent environment andwork very hard to overcome current economic difficultiesand achieve substantial output in the State-owned andprivate sectors. In that context  in 1997 gross domesticproduct increased by 10 per cent and industrial output by17 per cent  and the production of consumer goods alsorose. This all came about as a result of the efforts madeby the Belorussian people  as well as through thepromotion of subregional integration and cooperation withother countries.Belarus  like other CIS States  is painstakinglystriving to overcome the tremendous difficulties thatemerged in the country after the breakup of the SovietUnion. Now that we are in a period of transition  mycountry would be justified in expecting encouragement solidarity and support from the international community.We would appreciate such support from all countries andfrom every people of the world.The Republic of Belarus is committed to theconscientious fulfilment of all its international obligationsunder the United Nations Charter in their integrity  andwe wish success to the family of nations in this work."
"22",869,"BLZ",53,1998,"The election of the ForeignMinister of Uruguay as President of this GeneralAssembly is very gratifying to our delegation and we aresure that his enormous talents and experience will guideus effectively through this critical session.We also wish to acknowledge the contribution of hispredecessor for the admirable guidance he provided theAssembly over the past year.The inspired work of the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  has brought new life and meaning to theUnited Nations  and we are grateful to him for hisdedication to the task of modernizing the Organization.The commitment to ongoing reform and renewal in thisOrganization and the new vision and energy injected bythe Secretary-General have resulted in a revitalizedinstitution that offers new hope.In like fashion  the Belizean people demonstratedtheir political maturity when they turned out in recordnumbers a month ago to elect a Government committedto setting a new and higher standard of governance totake them through to the next millennium. We regard theoverwhelming mandate given to our new Administrationas a directive to transform our institutions and politicalculture into more democratic  open and just instrumentsfor the welfare of all our people.The work of reform and renewal is never-ending.With regard to the reform of the Security Council  while16we agree that this is urgently needed  we wish to urge allMembers to make every effort to ensure that the WorkingGroup produces a final package for the consideration of thisAssembly.It is to the credit of the United Nations that manymore people in today’s world benefit from a culture ofdemocracy and the rule of law. The United Nations has setthe pace in providing the support necessary to build andconsolidate the institutions of democracy. Central to thisachievement has been the fact that the economic  culturaland social aspects which underpin democracy have not beenignored.Perhaps the most powerful instrument for promotingdemocracy has been the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  whose fiftieth anniversary we celebrate this year.This basic document has been fortified over the years byother commitments relating to second-  third- and fourth-generation rights and to the rights of children  women andindigenous people. Taken together  these commitmentsconstitute a challenge which we are all called upon to liveup to.Belize is committed to pursue policies that lead to aneconomic and social climate which nurtures thedevelopment of our children and offers real opportunities toour young people to be creative and productive and todevelop self-respect  self-reliance and a sense of belongingto a community.Our Government recognizes the value of education inpromoting gender awareness and improving the economicsituation of women  upon whom poverty casts adisproportionate burden. Our policies for greateremployment  education in non-traditional areas andmicrocredit facilities will all be driven by gender awarenessto foster greater access and opportunity for Belizeanwomen.The International Decade of the World’s IndigenousPeople has served to raise public consciousness of theplight of peoples who for centuries have beendisadvantaged  exploited and marginalized. Our Governmenttakes seriously its duty to tangibly improve the quality ofdaily life for indigenous people and will engage inrespectful negotiations with them in regard to their concernsabout land  natural resources and other matters.The United Nations decolonization programme hasbeen hailed as one of the most successful of theOrganization’s undertakings over the past decades.However  enjoyment of the fundamental right to self-determination is still denied to the people of WesternSahara and East Timor. Belize will continue to supportthe work of the Special Committee on Decolonization toensure that these people are afforded opportunities for thefull expression of their will.This year presents us with a telling irony: even aswe celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration ofHuman Rights  we are painfully reminded that it is alsothe fiftieth anniversary of the dispossession of thePalestinian people. We continue to press for the fullrecognition of the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establish an independent State respecting the independence and security of all the Statesin that region.We are likewise concerned about the fact that asister Caribbean nation continues to suffer from a policydesigned to isolate it  even as it continues to be the targetof terrorist attacks. The most fundamental human rightsof the Cuban people are thus being violated  and we urgeall concerned to work together with us in CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) and in the Association ofCaribbean States to bring an end to this situation.Belize supports the efforts of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan to participate fully in the work of thisOrganization and its organs  as well as in internationalfinancial and developmental institutions. The time hascome for us to respect the sovereign will of thatpopulation  in conformity with the universalist principlesof our Charter.We all know that it is meaningless to talk abouthuman rights without addressing the fact that millions ofpeople are falling into poverty even as incredibleadvances in science and technology make possible theeradication of poverty. This tells us that something isterribly wrong about the way the world economy ismanaged. If some resisted this conclusion before  theinstability of the present world financial markets is surelyproof enough that unbridled globalization can haveserious negative effects on developing and developedcountries alike.We must move resolutely to create a new and fairmanagement regime for the world economy. We supportthe proposed United Nations conference on financing fordevelopment  which should include consideration of socialfactors and should seek to bring about comprehensivereform of the international financial system.17I speak for a country which has seen its prospectivebase of prosperity whittled away over the past few years bymisguided economic policies  predatory politics andfinancial mismanagement. Our Administration has inheriteda country where some 40 per cent of the people live inpoverty  where almost half of its children do not completeprimary school and where preventable diseases and infantmortality are on the rise. We have committed ourselves toan intensive integrated programme aimed at the eliminationof poverty  based on growth economics that will restoreinvestor confidence  stimulate economic activity andemployment and bring about more revenue fordevelopment.But the stark reality is that no matter how hard we try we cannot do it alone. We are  therefore  especiallyencouraged by the words of the British Prime Minister Tony Blair  spoken to this Assembly a week ago  at the 7thmeeting:“If we want to eradicate poverty  we also need toensure that the least developed countries benefit fromthis global economy ... [by] letting them sell theirgoods without imposing tariffs on them ... activelyhelping them benefit from globalization ... [and]rejecting any false allure of protectionism ... We alsohave to ease the debt burden on the poorest countries.”In this connection  we emphatically endorse the call ofthe Durban Summit of Non-Aligned Countries for newconcessional financial flows to debtor developing countries in addition to debt cancellation and other debt reliefmeasures.We are also witnessing progressive decreases in theamount of aid flowing to the developing countries. And toooften we are victims of a trend in international agencies ofspending millions on endless studies and consultancies when what we need are concrete actions to solve theproblems we long ago identified.We certainly welcome the work being done by theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for theprotection of our environment. Our population depends onits forests and clean seas to survive. The pristine conditionof our natural resources affords us a competitive advantageas a prime destination for eco-tourism  and their rationalmanagement and use is the only guarantee for oursustainable development.Yet we have witnessed the wanton destruction offorests by transnational corporations and the depletion ofmarine life by galloping consumption that is heedless ofthe fragility of our ecosystems and of the socialconsequences. The 1998 Human Development Reportconcludes that gross inequalities in consumption haveprevented over 1 billion people from meeting their basicconsumption requirements  a conclusion which led thereport’s coordinator  Richard Jolly  to call for patterns ofconsumption that are socially responsible  are notdestructive of the well-being of others  are sustainable anddo not degrade the natural resource base and environmentfor present and future generations.As if the uneven effects of the globalization of theworld economy were not enough to try us  we are facedwith the even more destructive phenomenon of theglobalization of crime and mindless violence  especiallyas manifested through the increased use of and traffickingin drugs and money-laundering. My country is in theunfortunate position of being along the way of the transittrade to the country of greatest demand  and we dailysuffer the consequences in the ruined lives of our youthand the increased incidence of crime. We are doingeverything possible to fight this scourge of mankind andwill cooperate fully with all regional and internationalefforts aimed at the effective curbing of the drug tradeand its insidiously corrupting effects on our institutionsand way of life.A world free of the curse of drugs  liberated fromthe affliction of poverty  blessed with freedom anddemocracy where people’s human right to a full anddignified life can be pursued in peace: this  surely  iswhat we are all striving for. Belize pledges to play itspart in that glorious struggle  even as we ask the UnitedNations to continue to support the independence andterritorial integrity of our nation  whose people  likehuman beings everywhere  seek only to assert theirabsolute and inalienable right to human dignity.In this search  we all need a vital and effectiveUnited Nations — this unique expression of our commonhumanity."
"23",916,"BOL",53,1998,"The election of the Foreign Minister ofUruguay as President of this session of the GeneralAssembly is a source of great pride to Latin America. It isalso a fitting tribute to Mr. Opertti  whose diplomaticexperience and skills augur well for the success of thisfifty-third session.Just when it seemed that we had secured stability signs of a severe crisis reappeared in the horizon. Indeed commodity prices have declined on average by 30 per cent reaching their lowest levels in the last three decades in realterms. Consequently  exports from Latin America todeveloped countries  consisting primarily of raw materials have begun to shrink  and trade balance deficits in theregion have increased proportionately.There has been a decline in growth of output in LatinAmerica. Businesses are reducing production volume paying less tax and going further into debt with the banks.There is a proportionate decline in domestic savings andinvestment in infrastructure  in the training of humanresources and in the production of goods and services.Visible unemployment is on the rise  and shadow economicactivities are gaining ground.This brief account — no less grim for its brevity —of the current situation points to a dangerous recession inAsia and Latin America.Of course  the fact that this turbulence began about ayear ago in Asia  halfway round the world  before reachingthe Andes  reveals the extent to which the world economicsystem has become interdependent. Both the scale and theconsequences of this interdependence would have beeninconceivable until recently. The planet has indeed becomethe global village which was to be the sign of the future  aswe had all heard.But there is an ugly and unfair side to globalizationthat I wish to stress. Countries — and when I use theword  I do not just mean abstract entities  but actualpeople with spiritual and material needs — are not payingonly for their own mistakes but also for the economicpolicy errors and negligence of others.Let me take my own country as an example. A smallcountry  with enormous structural limitations  it made agigantic effort  at enormous cost and at the price ofenormous sacrifices  to put its accounts and institutionalstructure in order. Bolivia overcame hyper-inflation restored its macroeconomic balance and made progress infirst- and second-generation structural reforms. Weestablished a democratic system which  while not perfect is being studied in our region as a model of politicalcooperation and social dialogue. We are prepared tocommit all our energies to casting off the historic chainsof corruption and poverty.This entire effort  just now beginning to beproductive  may be thwarted by causes that are beyondour control and for which we bear no responsibility. It istrue that our progress may not have been sufficientlyrapid and that our economic and social structures are stillweak  but the crisis we face today does not stem fromthese deficiencies.Bolivia and other countries will have to foot the billfor the mistakes of others  for far distant trivialities. Weare suffering  the analysts tell us  from the contagion ofthe Asian crisis  and we would do well to pray harder toprevent anything happening in our own country oranywhere in the broad region surrounding us.My country did what it had to do and did it well. Noone wants to go back to the past. No right-thinkingBolivian wants for a moment to return to the days ofauthoritarianism  hyper-inflation or the bureaucratic state.No  this is not what it is all about. But nor is it aboutacting as if nothing had happened — as if all that wasnecessary to overcome this crisis was to take a strongerdose of the same medicine. That would be anunforgivable mistake.The current situation has revealed such shortcomingsin the international system  particularly with regard tointernational financial flows  that it would not make senseto keep things as they are. Next month there will be ameeting of the Ministers of Finance of the Group ofSeven — the nexus of world economic power — todecide our fate. I do not know if our voice will be heard 16but I do believe that this Assembly of the peoples of theworld is itself a message that can at least remind them ofa few things.There is a need for prompt and concerted action onthe part of the advanced and developing countries todiminish the volatility of financial markets and to providesome discipline and procedures for incentives and penaltiesaimed at remedying the major shortcomings in thesemarkets. There must be an increase in the availability ofpublic financial resources in the International MonetaryFund and other institutions to compensate promptly andefficiently for damage caused by unduly heightened risk inany given country or by the wanton recklessness ofspeculators on the world’s stock markets.There must be a discussion very soon about the natureand the new role of the International Monetary Fund andthe World Bank and of the necessary adjustments thereto because these bodies were created in a context quitedifferent from that of today and clearly have beenoverwhelmed by the events of recent years  which could notbe prevented. Their structure  their resources  theirphilosophy and their modus operandi were severelycriticized since the 1980s in Latin America and in theAssembly  and today they have shown themselves to beunable to contain the impact of the current crisis. We haveglobalized the crises of poverty and unemployment. Let usalso globalize the commitment to solve them.By virtue of the universal nature of this body  byvirtue of the terms of the Charter of San Francisco andbecause it is here that the concerns and problems of theStates Members of this supreme world Organization shouldbe set forth  I must once again raise what is well known asBolivia’s maritime problem.Almost 120 years ago  in a military confrontation notof its own making  Bolivia lost a long strip of coastline onthe Pacific Ocean. Our country thus lost  temporarily  itsmaritime status  its sovereign access to the sea — anessential condition of its existence — as well as itsgeopolitical role and status as a bridge between the greatbasins of South America.The economic damage wrought by this loss wasimmense. I will not take time here today to mention thevalue of the minerals and fishing resources of this territory as it is incalculable. Suffice it to recall that recent studieshave shown that the cost of the landlocked condition of mycountry is estimated at $4 billion every 10 years  an amountequal to that of our foreign debt.However  perhaps the most serious consequence ofthis ill-fated event was that my country was condemnedto be penned in behind the Andes  far removed from themainstream of the passage of goods  peoples and cultures which are the very lifelines of the development ofnations. Therefore  ever mindful of the magnitude of thedamage  my country never accepted this status ofisolation imposed upon us. We have unceasingly calledfor this injustice to be redressed  but in doing so we haveabided by our tradition as peaceful people that rejectsconflicts. However  our voices never fell silent.We sought bilateral negotiations with Chile andbrought our case to international forums.On various occasions  the bilateral negotiationsconcluded with agreements or concrete proposals for asolution whose main objective was the return to Boliviaof its sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean  with acoastline  a port of its own and an overland link. Forreasons that I shall not go into now  these dealings werenever concluded and were added to the long list of lostopportunities on the record of relations between ourcountries.Bolivia’s cause has always been met with thesympathy and understanding of the internationalcommunity. There have been numerous expressions ofsuch solidarity. I would just like to refer to two  one inthe framework of the Non-Aligned Movement and theother in that of the Organization of American States(OAS). I will state only the relevant portion of theresolution adopted by the ninth General Assembly of theOrganization of American States  which was held in LaPaz in 1979. That resolution states  in its operative partthat “it is in the inherent interest of our hemisphere tofind an equitable solution whereby Bolivia canobtain sovereign and effective access to the PacificOcean”as part of a proposal aimed at “securing  in a spirit of fraternity and integration ofthe Americas  the objective referred to in theprevious paragraph and to consolidate a stable peacewhich would stimulate economic and social progressin the region of the Americas directly affected bythe consequences of Bolivia’s landlocked condition.”17In spite of everything  the problem still awaits asolution. It is a kind of throwback to another time  anotherlogic  another way of seeing relations between neighbouringnations. This has left an indelible mark on the memory ofmy country. I must therefore state emphatically before theAssembly that Bolivia will never back down from itsdemand and that it will not be discouraged by how long itsefforts may take. Bolivia has the staying power andlimitless patience of an ancient people and knows that thetime is sure to come when this long-standing issue will bedefinitively resolved. Our hope becomes conviction whenwe see how other nations find ways of unravelling theGordian knot of conflicts at least as complex as our own.The case made by President Hugo Banzer last year inthe Assembly is still valid. He recently put it again to thetwelfth presidential summit of the Rio Group in thefollowing terms:“There is no subject which cannot be discussed  if itis approached in good faith  without preconceptions orprejudices. The subjects of peace  security anddemocracy are not items reserved for diplomats andspecialists. All the institutions of society have anopinion to voice and ideas to contribute. These arevoices which must be heard and heeded. I wouldtherefore like to propose that wherever there is openconflict between our nations or where the embers ofancient conflicts still smoulder  let us call upon ourcitizens to help us find the path to solutions. Let usthrow open the windows of Latin American diplomacyand let in the fresh air of new opinions and the soundof new voices. Only recently I made the same pointby suggesting that Bolivians and Chileans meettogether and talk about the vast potential of ourrelationship and find a way of removing the obstacleswhich block its path. I am repeating this here today because I am convinced that we must find a way ofbreaking with the status quo. We cannot bindourselves to the inheritance of other times and otherproblems.”It could not be clearer that now is the time foreconomic integration and a political solution for access tothe ocean  not for confrontations. The nature of the globalsystem requires the formation of large-scale spaces inwhich ideas and goods can move freely  where commoninstitutions can be built and where new cultures can benurtured  the fruit of the mingling of diverse peoples. If thisis true anywhere  it is true in Latin America.In order to clear the path along these majorhighways  we must remove the obstacles that are blockingor hindering the march towards integration. In the case ofrelations between Bolivia and Chile  this means resolvingthe age-old disputes which led to the breaking off ofdiplomatic relations at the end of the 1970s. Theliberalization of trade  agreements on economiccomplementarity and arrangements for free transit are allessential parts of this picture  but not the whole picture.For this to happen  what is needed is vision andcourage on both sides. If we want to find new  differentsolutions in keeping with the times  we can no longerremain mired in the juridical  diplomatic and militarylogic of the past. If we want to find answers  we mayhave to move outside those circles that have traditionallyhandled these matters up to now. This is the sense of theproposal of President Banzer: to bring businessmen workers  churches  professionals and the peoples ofBolivia and Chile into the dialogue.Of course  the international community has a crucialrole to play in the search for agreement. The counsel guidance and help of friendly countries within theframework of the subregional integration processes inwhich they are engaged may just be the missing factorneeded to get dialogue going  to bring diplomats to thenegotiating table  to make leaders shoulder their historicalresponsibilities and to reach a solution bringing ourpeoples together. My country is convinced that theunderlying problems must be dealt with because we knowthat integration will be consolidated only when economicagreements guarantee that it will be sustained by thepolitical will and confidence of our nations.There are many initiatives that should not be leftonly on paper. Last June  during the special sessiondevoted to the drug problem  important proposals weremade. Bolivia put forth the idea of creating a body similar to a consultative group  made up of countries thatwould help finance the high cost of the fight against drug-trafficking. We would like to know what steps have beentaken to implement this  as well as the other initiativesthat were proposed in that highly important specializedforum.The phenomenon of corruption  which is no strangerto most countries represented here  is a disease thatspreads and damages our institutional structures  saps thelegitimacy of democracy  distorts the economy  createsbad habits in public administration and erodes morality.18In compliance with a presidential order  last 21September we had the honour of celebrating at a solemnceremony the signing of an accord among the principalinstitutions of the State representing the three branches ofpower  whereby the National Integrity Plan came intoeffect. This Plan establishes a comprehensive strategy tocombat corruption. The judicial basis for the Plan is takenfrom the Inter-American Convention against Corruption which was signed by the member States of the OAS in1996 and which Bolivia was the first nation to ratify as thelaw of the land.After careful thought  we have made this policy oneof the highest priorities of the Government of Bolivia. Wehave begun to put into effect the first concrete measures tocombat this evil and to make this proposal State policy. Wenow invite the international community to follow ourendeavour closely and to support our initiative.Bolivia vigorously adheres to all the statements thathave repudiated terrorism  a despicable practice that has nojustification whatsoever. It will support any initiative oraction that may be put forth to fight it.In another area  we wish to underline the Secretary-General’s task in the process of the reform of the UnitedNations. We believe that there has been progress in theefforts to reduce bureaucracy  rationalize expenses andavoid duplication in the work of the United Nations. Wealso believe that it would be healthy to enhance theEconomic and Social Council in order to turn it into aneconomic  social  scientific and technological council. Itwould also be worthwhile to create a council forhumanitarian affairs responsible for social problems of ourtime  such as poverty  unemployment  discrimination and allforms of exclusion.We meet every year to express our concerns andthoughts  to share experiences and reaffirm our faith in thepurposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter. Eachyear  we would like to see positive advances in the solutionof problems  in joint responses to crises  in the spread ofpeace on the world map. Thus  the United Nations willcontinue to grow even stronger. Bolivia wishes  as always to contribute to the achievement of those goals."
"24",963,"BRA",53,1998,"Mr. President  your electionto preside over the fifty-third session of the UnitedNations General Assembly is especially gratifying for usBrazilians. Brazil and Uruguay came into being as sisternations  and our bonds are becoming ever stronger. Witheach passing day  our destinies are more and more linkedtogether. The opportunity I have of working closely withmy friend  Didier Opertti  allows me to say withconviction that at this session the Assembly will have aformidable President. In the exercise of this importanttask  you will benefit from the example set by yourpredecessor. At the helm of the fifty-second session Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko was able to guide and motivatedelegations and to provide valuable impulse to theproposals for reform put forward by the Secretary-General.Because of his dedication to the task of modernizingour Organization and  above all  because of his decisiverole in situations that pose a real threat to internationalpeace and security  the Secretary-General deserves ourapplause. The diplomatic talent and serene daring revealedby Mr. Kofi Annan confirm that we have in him a leaderwho is up to the challenges and opportunities before us.It was an honour for us to have welcomed him in Brazilthis past July.The defining trait of this particular moment is thetroubling instability that besets global financial markets.Since the last quarter of 1997  when we first felt theshock waves of what was then called the “Asian crisis” the world economy has been suffering the effects of aphenomenon whose reach  depth and permanence are stillnot clear. But the international community cannot wait with arms crossed  for the course of events to shed lighton our quandary.It is both legitimate and necessary that Governmentsact to try to prevent problems that may arise. In an eramarked by the rapid integration of national economies such action by Governments will increasingly have to bemade through coordination in the international sphere.Although there is still no consensus as to thedimension of the crisis we face  nor on the prognosis forits duration  there seems to be a growing convergence ofpoints of view regarding the impact of the high volatilityof capital movements. The events of the past few months5have revealed a serious lag between growing financialinterdependence and the modest effectiveness of existinginternational mechanisms for dialogue and coordination.Since the beginning of his Administration  PresidentFernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil has been calling theattention of other world leaders to the task of making theglobal financial system more stable and predictable. Inrepeated messages to G-7 members  beginning in 1995  heoffered concrete proposals: to increase cooperation amongmonetary authorities; to expand coordination ofmacroeconomic policies among countries that can haveconsiderable impact on world finance; to upgradeinternational monitoring capacity over domesticmacroeconomic policy; and to expand mechanisms aimedat stabilizing currencies under speculative attack. Therehave been  of course  considerable advances along some ofthese lines  but the measures adopted still fall far short ofwhat is needed. Until now  political will has notcorresponded to the magnitude and gravity of the situation.The crisis will not resolve itself. We must join together toface it.In this  as in other fields of international life  we mustavoid at all costs an attitude that  back in the seventies Brazilian Foreign Minister Azeredo da Silveira described as“the postponement syndrome”.Experience teaches us that inaction can have a highcost. It also teaches that answers given by various countriesto crisis situations  if guided by irrational or spur-of-the-moment reactions  can turn these situations into evengreater problems  prolonging their effects over time andaggravating people’s suffering.One can imagine extreme scenarios of a return toclosed economic models  to the search for elusive self-sufficiency and isolation  to notions of national securitybased on distrust of others and on the insecurity of others.Such scenarios must not become reality. We cannot allowit.Progress in international relations dependsfundamentally on the perception of the international arenanot as a source of potential threat  but as an environment inwhich risks can be reduced and difficulties overcome by apooling of wills and resources.Ours is not a world in which nations should be left totheir own devices. The cost of such a course is invariablyhigher than the energy or resources saved by attempts todistance oneself from the problems of others. Thewillingness to deal collectively with problems willmotivate individual countries to believe in the benefit ofseeking international consideration of matters in theirdirect interest. The world cannot depend only on thewillingness  capacity and interest of a select number ofcountries to mobilize and lead international efforts in thisor that direction.We can no longer accept situations  such as thepresent financial crisis  in which  despite the undeniablyinternational nature of the phenomenon  Governments andsocieties simply do not fully trust any of the existingorganizations or mechanisms as a source of support guidance or even interpretation of the problem at hand.We must give serious consideration to the fact thatgrowing interdependence renders indispensable effectivegovernance at the international level.We have before us an essentially political challenge.This does not mean simply modernizing decision-makingprocedures or administrative structures  but also giving tomultilateral treatment of issues the priority it so oftenreceives in our speeches and statements.A large gap still remains between the recognitionthat the central problems facing humanity must be dealtwith at the international level and the resistance ofGovernments and societies to act in accordance with thatrecognition. This is most evident in the allocation ofresources and in the adoption of policies capable ofgenerating external repercussions.In that same vein  if the link between the nationaland the international is ever greater  peace anddevelopment are also increasingly related. A world rackedby economic instability or despair cannot be a safeenvironment  free of the threat of war  conflict andviolence. But the reverse is also true: material and socialprogress presupposes minimal conditions of security andpeaceful coexistence among and within countries. Wemust advance on both fronts by working to establish aclimate of confidence in the political-strategic realm andin the essential context of the global economy.Brazil’s relative weight and the history of ourinternational behaviour are some of our country’s mostimportant credentials. These credentials are strengthenedtoday by the maturity of our democracy and by thevigorous modernization of the Brazilian economy.Under the leadership of President Cardoso  we haverenewed our permanent willingness to play a more active6role in building a world order conducive to peace anddevelopment. This spirit guides Brazil’s international action particularly within the United Nations.I wish to point out that  in the Security Council andother United Nations bodies  our delegation  led byAmbassador Celso Amorim  has faithfully reflected thiscentral guideline of Brazilian foreign policy.In 1998  we have completed our participation in theinternational non-proliferation regime. We have ratified theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) andacceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT)  which was approved by Brazil’s NationalCongress this past July. Three days ago in Washington  Ihad the satisfaction of personally depositing the instrumentof accession to the NPT  in tandem with our Ambassadorsin London and Moscow.These decisions lend formal and symbolic support tothe commitment to use nuclear energy for exclusivelypeaceful purposes. This commitment is enshrined in theBrazilian Constitution and is strengthened by the bilateraland regional pacts we have signed. The existing agreementsand the cooperation between Brazil and Argentina  as wellas the Treaty of Tlatelolco  are exemplary achievements inthis field.Brazil thus feels particularly motivated to call uponnuclear-armed States  and upon those with the capability ofproducing such weapons  to take decisive steps towardsdisarmament. We also expect that Governments which havestill not become party to the NPT  the CTBT and otherrelevant instruments and mechanisms will do so at an earlydate.As an expression of the determination which motivatesus to work for this cause  Brazil  together with seven otherfriendly countries  signed the “Declaration on a NuclearWeapon Free World: the Need for a New Agenda” on 9June of this year. During the current session of the GeneralAssembly  together with our partners in the Declaration  weintend to present a draft resolution aimed at boosting andguiding efforts towards the complete and definitiveelimination of nuclear weapons.There is no longer room or justification for postponingaction in the nuclear field or in the broader fight toeliminate all weapons of mass destruction. The cost of afailure to do so could be truly catastrophic  and the risksare evident to all.The Brazilian Government  as the coordinator of theguarantor countries of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol  hasbeen making a sustained effort to assist Ecuador and Peruin reaching at the earliest possible date a solid and finalagreement on the border differences that have kept themapart for decades. Our diplomatic services — togetherwith those of Argentina  Chile and the United States —stand ready to continue making the best possiblecontribution.Recent developments confirm the prognosis that thepeace process is on its way to a conclusion and reflect thepolitical will and the high level of engagement withwhich Ecuador and Peru have been working towards thatend.The fact that South America is a region in whichcountries essentially live in a harmonious  peaceful andincreasingly integrated manner is for Brazil a vital anddefining trait that our peoples are determined to preserve.The same applies to the permanence of democraticregimes as a common thread of the nations in ourcontinent. It is a higher value to which we are collectivelycommitted in the Southern Cone Common Market(MERCOSUR)  the Rio Group and the Organization ofAmerican States (OAS).The advent and consolidation of democracy was thedetermining factor in the extraordinary work ofintegration in which South American nations are engaged.This is an accomplishment of our societies that theGovernments of the region must always be prepared todefend as one. This is a basic tenet of Brazilian foreignpolicy.Brazil attaches the utmost importance to theadvancement of human rights. As we celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  we should recognize the persistent gap betweenprinciples and generally accepted rules of internationallaw  on the one hand  and the prevalent realities of theworld  on the other.The Brazilian Government is engaged in the fight toovercome the distance between norms and facts in ourcountry. We are prepared to draw from the internationalenvironment elements that may help us realize anaspiration shared by all Brazilians. This was the mainthrust of President Cardoso’s submission to the NationalCongress of the decision to recognize the mandatoryjurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.7President Cardoso is also committed to the fightagainst the drug trade. His presence at the special sessionof the General Assembly this past June was clear proof ofthis commitment.Our participation in the effort to build a lasting peaceextends beyond the Americas. The Brazilian military andpolice have taken part in United Nations forces in manyparts of the world  particularly in Portuguese-speakingcountries in Africa  to which we are bound by history andculture.Brazil has followed developments in Angola withconcern. The United Nations must firmly insist that UNITAfulfil the commitments undertaken in the Lusaka Protocol.An unravelling of the situation could jeopardize theprogress achieved in the peace process and would be tragicindeed. Angolans have been subjected to untold sufferingfor decades. The international community must doeverything within its reach so that Angola may finallydedicate itself to reconstruction and development.The Brazilian Government  along with the othermembers of the Community of Portuguese-SpeakingCountries  is engaged in seeking a peaceful solution to thegrave internal crisis faced by Guinea-Bissau. TheCommunity  in close coordination with countries in theregion  has contributed to spurring significant progress. Wewill continue to pursue favourable conditions for the urgentand complete normalization of life in that sister nation.As for East Timor — to which we are also bound byhistory and a common language — Brazil welcomes thenew spirit that presides over this delicate and complexissue  especially in the context of the tripartite negotiationsbetween the Portuguese and Indonesian Governments  underthe auspices of the Secretary-General.The Brazilian Government has maintained a positivedialogue with the parties involved and is determined toassist  to the limit of its possibilities  in finding an adequateequation for all concerned  with progressive participation bythe Timorese themselves.Since the advent of economic stability in 1994  Brazilhas shown renewed dynamism with the strengthening of ourdomestic market and the outlook for development withsocial justice.But present-day Brazil does not see its development asisolated or self-contained. We realize that the destiny of oureconomy is increasingly linked to that of the economies ofour neighbours and partners  in the framework of anintegration process that has decidedly contributed toprogress in the region and to the well-being of oursocieties  particularly within MERCOSUR.The fruits of this process serve not only the goal ofeconomic development but also  and most importantly  thecause of social justice  which remains the foremost taskof our region.We welcome the results of the most recent edition ofthe United Nations Human Development Report. Thenumbers show that  in spite of all that remains to be done our country has made extraordinary social progress overthe past two decades in the areas of health  education  thefight against poverty and the reduction of disparitiesamong the various regions of the country. Even thoughwe still face daunting challenges  Brazilians are leadinga better life  as our presence among those nations ofgreater human development indicates.Consistent with its domestic policies and its regionalrole  Brazil will continue to fight for a more balancedallocation of the benefits of economic interdependence without distortions such as those resulting fromprotectionist policies of developed countries.Such policies affect in a particularly cruel mannerthe developing countries and serve to reinforce thearguments of those who preach domestically a return toclosed economic models. In the current context of globaleconomic turbulence  we must demand that the developedcountries establish greater coherence between free-traderhetoric and their unfair trade practices.President Cardoso has stated that we must abandonthe path of globalization with exclusion — in thedecision-making process as well as in the distribution ofbenefits — and seek globalization with solidarity in bothof those dimensions.Reforming and strengthening the United Nations isan essential part of building a world of greater solidarity.The Brazilian Government recognizes the significantprogress that has already been made in terms of structuraland functional modernization of the Organization. Weagree with the Secretary-General when he says thatreform must not be seen as an event  but as a process; butwe cannot but stress that an important part of that processhas yet to be undertaken.8For Brazil  reforming the United Nations necessarilyimplies updating the functioning and composition of theSecurity Council  which still mirrors a period of history thatis now long gone. That does not mean — and I have statedthis before in this forum — that the particular interests ofthis or that country should be taken into account. What itdoes mean is that fundamental deficiencies in terms oflegitimacy  representativeness and effectiveness must beredressed. We will continue to defend expansion in bothcategories of members  with the presence  in both  ofdeveloping countries.It is inconceivable that  on the eve of the newmillennium  reform of the Organization could exclude therestructuring of the Security Council.The basis of global solidarity is the establishment oftrust between societies. There is no other way if we are toestablish a peaceful  stable and constructive internationalenvironment. Our so-called global village is still far frombecoming a truly integrated community  in which peoplecan consider themselves as participants in the samehistorical process.Of the many merits of international organizations  oneof the most important is that they offer a framework ofinteraction that favours the development of a true sense ofuniversal communion. In dealing with common problems Governments learn in practice just how much they need towork more and more closely together. In internationalforums  we are constantly weaving a web of relations basedon a stronger identity and trust between our nations andtheir leaders. Countries must trust one another  but theymust also have a reason to trust in the legitimacy andefficiency of multilateral organizations and procedures inorder to tackle their most important problems.The dynamics of international life demand a constantupdating of the instruments at the disposal of thecommunity of nations to allow it to act collectively in theface of its greatest challenges.We must have the courage to recognize that neverbefore have the risks and the cost of procrastination been sohigh. We must  above all  have the will to make thedecisions that can ultimately restore our faith in ourselves in our capacity to state that history does goes on  and thatwe are pointing it in the direction of a more just and betterworld."
"25",1007,"BRB",53,1998,"It is my special pleasureto congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti  as the honouredrepresentative of the Group of Latin American andCaribbean States  on his election to preside over the fifty-third session of the General Assembly  and to extend tohim the full cooperation of the Barbados delegation. Iwish also to express our deep appreciation to hispredecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for his effectiveleadership and management of the fifty-second session ofthe General Assembly — the reform Assembly.This fifty-third session  which is coming to a closeat the dawn of the twenty-first century  compels us tofocus on the preparedness of the United Nations for thechallenges of the new millennium. It could well be ahistoric session  if it resolves to equip and re-energize theOrganization to seize this great moment.The process of global reform is under way. Barbadosstrongly supports the proposals of the Secretary-General particularly those aimed at improving the Organization?sefficiency and effectiveness. My delegation is pleasedwith the encouraging start to this process. We wouldcaution  however  against reforms that are driven undulyby staff reduction targets or predetermined by budgetaryconstraints. To do so could well jeopardizeimplementation of the very Programmes of Action of theglobal conferences — from Rio to Rome — whichconstitute the global priorities endorsed by MemberStates.Meaningful reform also obliges us to come to termswith the financial crisis which has constrained theOrganization far too long  injuring its integrity andnecessitating the use of creative accounting methods tokeep it afloat. Prolonged non-payment of arrears by thelargest contributor is not a proud legacy to the UnitedNations of the twenty-first century. Let us put thisOrganization on a sound financial footing through prompt29settlement of arrears  without conditions  consistent with ourCharter obligations.Reform of the Security Council is also a keyimperative if the United Nations is to remain relevant in thetwenty-first century. In particular  the Council must betterreflect the Organization?s current membership  and it mustconduct its deliberations with greater transparency.The growing threat to global peace and security hasput the Organization?s capacity to cope under considerablestress  underscoring the urgent need to streamline andmodernize its peacekeeping machinery. We envisaged thatthe end of the cold war would usher in a new era of peaceand stability  but the changed nature of conflict has foundthe Organization?s traditional machinery ill-equipped andthe political will to act severely constrained  even in theface of unthinkable crimes against humanity.That is why my delegation hails the successfuloutcome of the recent Conference of Plenipotentiaries heldin Rome  resulting in the creation of a permanentInternational Criminal Court. This landmark Statute is afitting complement to the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  whose fiftieth anniversary we celebrate this year.We are pleased to recall that it was the delegation ofTrinidad and Tobago that introduced the item on thecreation of an international criminal court at the forty-fourthsession of the Assembly  in 1989.The post-cold-war world has not become a safer place.New eruptions of strife and the intractability of old conflictshave worsened the fragile political situation in manydeveloping countries. Such instability has diverted energiesand resources from the policy priorities of sustainabledevelopment and poverty reduction. Ninety percent oftoday?s conflicts take place within countries  not betweencountries. And the majority of casualties are civilians  notsoldiers; thus the heightened international concern with theloss of life and disability of thousands of innocent victimsevery year. Barbados therefore joined 121 States in Ottawalast December in signing the Convention on the Prohibitionof the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Its entry intoforce by 1 March 1999 will come not a moment too soon.Barbados recognizes the growing danger under whichUnited Nations peacekeepers carry out their duties andlaments the recent loss of life at a number of stations. Weappeal to all parties to conflicts to respect the neutral roleof these brave and dedicated servants of peace  and turn toreconciliation and compromise; only then will they be ableto foster the domestic stability that is so critical forsustained economic growth and for improving the livingstandards of their people.The widening scene of strife and instability threatensglobal peace and security on a number of fronts. Stallednegotiations between Israel and Palestine have renewedour anxiety about the prospects for peace in a regionweary of conflict. The arm of terrorism has now reachedcountries hitherto spared from this scourge. Internationaltrafficking in illegal drugs and arms — in particular small arms — poses the most serious threat to democracyand society in small States.Nuclear tests have created new fears about theproliferation issue. We will continue to support the goalsof non-proliferation  leading to the elimination of allnuclear weapons.Barbados will continue to condemn  in the strongestterms  all acts of terrorism. We will work assiduouslywith regional partners  the United Nations InternationalDrug Control Programme  and the internationalcommunity to implement the Barbados Programme ofAction to fight the scourge of drug-trafficking.The lesson of this security situation is clear.Remedies are beyond the capacity of individual countries even the most developed. The reality of globalinterdependence demands a greater commitment tocollective security goals and better coordination of actionsagainst the global security threat.I now turn briefly to another dimension of the globalsecurity problem — namely  human security. In thisconnection  let me acknowledge the debt of gratitudewhich developing countries owe to the distinguishedPakistani economist  the late Mahbub ul Haq  my friendand colleague. More than any other  he made the humancondition central to modern development thinking especially through his pioneering work in the HumanDevelopment Report series of the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP). His intellectualcontribution to the debate on sustainable development andpoverty reduction was substantial. It focused policyattention on people  and in particular on the plight ofmore than one fifth of the world?s population that lives inconditions of poverty and hopelessness.This concern with the right to development for allpeople should be a central component of the discussionon globalization and liberalization and the impact of these30phenomena on developing countries  especially the poorestcountries. We believe the United Nations must be theconscience of the international community on behalf of thepoor and vulnerable in this global conversation.My delegation therefore welcomed the recent high-level dialogue of the General Assembly on the social andeconomic impact of globalization and interdependence andtheir policy implications. We found the discussionsinstructive. There was broad agreement that the process ofglobalization has opened new possibilities for fastereconomic growth and improved living standards through thefree flow of capital across borders. However  manydeveloping countries have not yet shared in the fruits of thisprocess. And while the benefits are obvious  the associatedrisks  though grave  are less evident. Who would haveenvisaged that the East Asian economies would be engulfedby a financial crisis of such a scale  and to such a degreeof volatility and dislocation as to threaten the very fabric oftheir societies and  indeed  the global economy?While many questions have been raised about the prosand cons of unrestricted capital flows which underlie thiscrisis  and the role of the Bretton Woods institutions in thisglobal order  reassuring answers are few. Clearly  the crisispoints in part to deficiencies in the global architecture andgovernance of finance. We discern a world economy soradically altered from that of even a decade ago that we areobliged to focus on the deficit in our understanding of howit works  and on how to design a new structure for itsorderly governance. Since there is as yet no settledapproach to adjustment policy towards globalization — inparticular  measures to protect the poor and vulnerablegroups — the voice of the United Nations must be raisedin debate on these critical areas of enquiry.Small island developing States  given theirvulnerability to both environmental and economic shocks are following with much anxiety these developments in theglobal economy. We welcome a number of ongoing studieson the vulnerability of small island developing States. InDecember 1997  an Ad Hoc Expert Group Meeting onVulnerability Indices for Small Island Developing States convened by the United Nations Secretariat  concluded thatas a group  small island developing countries are morevulnerable than other groups of developing countries. Morerecently  a high-level committee established by theSecretary-General of the Commonwealth  and chaired byThe Right Honourable Owen Arthur  Prime Minister ofBarbados  held consultations with key internationalagencies  including the World Bank  the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization(WTO)  on the vulnerability of small island developingStates  particularly in the current global situation.As if to reinforce this reality  just a few days agohurricane Georges dealt us a brutal reminder  wiping outin a matter of hours economic growth which took yearsto accumulate. We lament the heavy loss of life and thewidespread destruction of property in a number of oursister islands of the Caribbean  as well as in the southernUnited States. We join in the appeal for urgentinternational assistance.Barbados shares with developing countries thegrowing concern about the impact of globalization andliberalization  given its limited resource base and technicalcapacity. We recognize that adaptation to this irreversibleprocess is an imperative  not an option  and that countrieswill pay a high price for policy of inaction. Barbados istherefore implementing a broad program of social economic and institutional reform to better manage rapidglobal change while deepening its integration into theregional economy  especially the Caribbean Community(CARICOM). The recent conference of heads ofGovernment  held in Saint Lucia from 30 June to 4 July marked the silver jubilee of CARICOM  and gave furtherimpetus to the process towards a single market andeconomy.In response to the increasing policy demands ofglobalization  CARICOM States have establishedtechnical machinery  under high-level political direction to underpin regional negotiations under way within thehemisphere. These negotiations will lead to a Free TradeArea of the Americas (FTAA) in 2005. This will be thelargest and most differentiated of regional trading blocks.We recognize that technical support will be required onan ongoing basis to ensure that small States develop thecapacity to negotiate effectively  share equitably in thebenefits of trade and secure transition arrangements onentry that will minimize economic dislocation.At the wider international level  Barbados waspleased to host in May 1998 the sixty-seventh session ofthe Council of Ministers of the African  Caribbean andPacific (ACP)  as well as the meeting of the twenty-thirdjoint ACP-European Union (EU) Council of Ministers.These consultations focused on future ACP-EU relations in particular  the structure of cooperation following theexpiration of the Lomé Convention in the year 2000.Following those gatherings  Barbados assumed thepresidency of the ACP Council of Ministers  which will31today  29 September  launch formal negotiations forsuccessor arrangements to the Lomé Convention. Hereagain  the participation of CARICOM will be bolstered bythe technical work and direction of the regional negotiatingmechanism. CARICOM States will seek opportunities forfruitful cooperation and information-sharing with other ACPmembers during the course of these critical negotiations.Even a passing reference to ACP-EU relations triggersour concern about the long-standing and still unresolvedissue of banana exports from CARICOM States to theEuropean Union. The WTO decision on this matter  ifimplemented  will have a devastating impact on affectedcountries? economies and on the livelihood of large sectionsof their populations. Moreover  it would create uncertaintyabout investment and the overall prospects for developmentin the region. CARICOM States remain deeply seized ofthis question and hope that a satisfactory solution of thisgrievance can be reached soon.My delegation looks forward to the special session ofthe General Assembly in September 1999  at which theBarbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States will bereviewed. Within the framework of the Alliance of SmallIsland States (AOSIS)  we will participate actively in thepreparatory process  including the planned donors?conference in February 1999. We believe that conferencewill provide a useful opportunity to foster support for aportfolio of priority projects that will boost implementationof this Programme over the next several years.We attach similar importance to the meeting of theCommission on Sustainable Development scheduled forApril 1999  which will help deepen our preparation for thespecial session. That meeting will focus on sustainabletourism and oceans  the virtual lifeline of small islanddeveloping States. It will underline our concern with thepreservation and sustainable management of our marineresources and highlight our anxiety over the use of theCaribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of nuclear and otherhazardous materials through this fragile marine ecosystem.That is why CARICOM States will seek recognition of theCaribbean Sea as a special area in the context ofsustainable development.The special session will be an important landmark inthe implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.Barbados is proud of this international Programme thatbears its name. It remains a sound blueprint for policieswhich support the sustainable development of small islanddeveloping States  taking into account their special needsand vulnerabilities. We believe that with the continuedcooperation and support of our international partners wecan strengthen the implementation of the Programme ofAction and consolidate its long-term viability.Let me conclude by saying that the fifty-thirdsession of the General Assembly has before it manycritical issues for consideration. My delegation believes however  that none has higher priority than renewedcommitment to this indispensable Organization and to thestrengthening of its capacity to meet the challenges of thenew millennium. Small island developing States believedeeply in the United Nations. It has placed theirvulnerability firmly into the consciousness of theinternational community. But more than that  this is theonly institution which embodies the goals of peace andsecurity  sustainable development  democracy and socialjustice  which define our common humanity.Barbados pledges its full commitment and support tothis universal mission."
"26",1039,"BRN",53,1998,"Iextend my congratulations to Mr. Opertti on his electionand my appreciation to the former President for all hiswork over the last year.In looking back over the year  I think we would agreethat it has been extremely disturbing for most developingnations. At best  it has been one of troubling uncertaintyand a deep sense of frustration. At worst  it has seen terrorand despair. It is the uncertainty felt by millions in our ownregion  caught unprepared by the process of globalizationand ending up unemployed. It is the frustration experiencedby those like the current  third adult generation ofPalestinian refugees who declare with understandabledefiance that they have suffered enough. It is the terror ofthe innocent victims of bombings; of those who flee fromcivil war; or of those  such as the people of Kosovo andRwanda  who have experienced savage inhumanity. It is thedespair of our neighbours in China  Bangladesh and PapuaNew Guinea  stricken by devastating natural disasters.For many  many millions of people  the end of thiscentury is not a time for any millennial celebrations. It isa time of enormous human suffering. As many of usremarked at the recent summit of the Non-AlignedMovement  at a time when technology presents greateropportunity for human development than ever before andwhen the power of globalization offers us unique chancesto work together  how can this possibly be?In trying to answer this question  the Non-AlignedMovement recently spoke of a primary need to voice thesuffering of the billions it represents. It also spoke of thisAssembly as the only forum in which that voice can beheard with the strength and insistence it deserves.That is why I would like to thank our Secretary-General  not just for attending the Non-Aligned summit but also for displaying heartfelt concern for the specialproblems faced by developing nations. Above all  I wouldlike to thank him for what I feel is crucial in thedeveloping world today  and that is the call he has madefor leadership: leadership in ending local hostilities;leadership in making peace processes work; and  perhapsmost important of all  leadership in summoning thepolitical will to translate policies made at the national regional or global level into day-to-day real benefits forordinary people. It is leadership  in short  aimed atencouraging two things: first  tolerance in the acceptanceof differences and the need to resolve all disputespeacefully  no matter how hard this may be; and secondly  in placing people at the core of policy-making.As the Secretary-General has stated  the UnitedNations is a place where the connection can be made —one which is so often neglected elsewhere — betweeneconomic and social development on the one hand andinternational peace and security on the other. We entirelyagree with him. His observations reflect the need for us toaddress not policy positions  but ordinary people’sproblems — jobs  education  food and security — and toaddress them from their own perspectives and needs.That is why we very much appreciate the fact that thevarious conferences this body has hosted within the last 12months have been directed towards recognizing people andtheir day-to-day concerns. This is also very much inagreement with the strong appeal we made last year  when in the context of United Nations reform  we stated that whatever we do  we have to be sure that nothing weakenswhat the United Nations does well for ordinary people. Bythis I mean its work in the field. It is this which gives theOrganization meaning to billions. It is the fundamentalreason for the existence of the United Nations today  abody founded in the name of “we the peoples”.So  in commending our Secretary-General’s efforts  Iwould also like to give him our full support in fulfilling thepeoples’ need for economic prosperity and socialdevelopment  and in ensuring that these two concernsremain firmly connected. This will place the emphasis inthe United Nations on work which will reinforce peace andstability  reject violence and confrontation and strengthenthe foundation of social development. In other words nothing in the interests of ordinary people can be solved byviolence and war. If they have to exist  let the violence bedirected against despair and the war be made on suffering."
"27",1081,"BTN",53,1998,"It is with great pleasure thatI congratulate you  Mr. President  on your unanimouselection to preside over the General Assembly at thissession. This session is particularly significant because weare celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. It is also important for aless uplifting reason: during this session the internationalcommunity is confronted with serious challenges and ishard pressed to find collective wisdom to deal withdisturbing developments and trends. As you guide us inour deliberations on these issues  I wish you well andwould like to extend to you the full support of mydelegation. I also wish to join the preceding speakers  allof whom have justly praised the excellent work done byyour predecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko.Our Secretary-General stated in his address to therecent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement that“human rights are not simply a matter of civil andpolitical freedom. Genuine freedom of choicerequires economic  social and cultural emancipationtoo.”From the very beginning of our development process andto ensure such emancipation  Bhutan has been guided bya philosophy of maintaining a harmonious balancebetween material and spiritual prosperity. This we believeis the way forward to attaining our goal of gross nationalhappiness.I have the pleasure to inform the Assembly that thethrone of the Kingdom of Bhutan has always been thefountainhead of the many changes in our country whichhave led to greater empowerment of the people. Just threemonths ago our King introduced  through the NationalAssembly  some profound changes in the governance ofour country. These changes are in addition to the earlierinstitutionalization of participatory decision makingprocesses at the district and grass-roots levels. Upondissolution of the appointed Cabinet  a new Council ofMinisters has been elected for a specific term by theNational Assembly. His Majesty the King has voluntarilyrelinquished his role as the head of Government and wasfurther successful in convincing the National Assembly tointroduce a mechanism for the removal of a reigningmonarch through a periodic vote of confidence. Suchongoing changes have further strengthened the rule of lawand have enhanced even further the direct participation ofthe people in development and governance.7As we stand at the threshold of another millennium ofhuman civilization  our generation of leaders and policymakers must not fail to grasp the unprecedentedopportunities. Ours is the past and ours  too  is the future.Even as we are engaged in the last defining moments of thetwentieth century  we have a decisive role in shaping thebeginning of the next thousand years. We cannot undermineour own role. Narrow interests and differences must not beallowed to deter us from the greater legacy we owe toposterity.I believe that we should look upon all the challengesthat have spiralled in recent years as a last reminder of thegrowing vulnerabilities of human society. There is theAsian crisis  which now threatens to cause global economiccontraction and is already undermining the social andpolitical stability of some nations. The environment iswreaking havoc in many quarters of the world  causing lossof life and property in both the richest and the poorestcountries. And just as trade  technology and the reality ofinterdependence force us to abide with each other in aworld that is shrinking in space and natural resources  wefind ourselves torn apart by bigotry  intolerance and hate.Terrorism is on the rise  our children are lured by drugsand crime  and even the richest nations among us can illafford the rising cost of growing prison populations. Then there is the spectre of a nuclear holocaust  which continuesto haunt us. Unless we look at our future and manage thecompelling forces of globalization with a greater sense ofspirituality and social concern  I fear that the global villagewill fail to provide much of that elusive state of joy andcontentment to which we all aspire.Terrorism in all its manifestations is unjustifiable regardless of the cause it seeks to espouse. It must becondemned in the strongest of terms. Those who use terroror the threat of terror target innocent people. Theirobjectives are clear: to foster an environment of fear if theirgoals are not met. Such heinous crimes against humanitymust not go unpunished. The voices of those who live inconstant fear of having the most fundamental of humanrights — the right to live without fear and the right to lifeitself — abused and violated can no longer be ignored. Theconclusion and effective implementation of acomprehensive international convention on terrorismtherefore assumes great significance.The recent nuclear tests in South Asia have arousedmuch concern. However  we are heartened by the positivesteps being taken by the concerned parties to calm the fearsof the international community. As a small  peace-lovingcountry  Bhutan has always condemned nuclear armamentand advocated full and comprehensive elimination of allnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Ourdelegation urges all participants in the disarmamentprocesses to undertake a more realistic assessment of theprevailing global security arrangement  which  we believe has the inherent weakness of enticing States to join anexclusive club. Unless there is an accelerated processtowards complete and comprehensive denuclearizationbeyond the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) and beyond the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  the world must be prepared toface the eventuality of a nuclear club that will lose itsexclusivity.Active and not passive interdependence is theprimary condition for all human progress in the future. Itis clear that prosperity in one part of the global villagecannot be sustained when poverty prevails in the other.Yet unconscionable levels of disparity continue to growbetween the rich and the poor countries. While onesection of human society is burying itself in the waste ofconspicuous and excessive consumption  the other isplagued by hunger and exposure. Against this backdrop it is sad to note that shrinkage of official developmentassistance remains a serious concern. Political will mustbe generated to reverse this trend and to inject newvitality into international cooperation for development inthe interest of shared and sustainable prosperity.Revitalization and reform of our Organization hasbeen the singular underlying theme of recent sessions ofthe General Assembly. We are all agreed on the need formajor changes if the United Nations is to effectively meetthe current and emerging challenges of the twenty-firstcentury. As we continue to assess the long-termimplications of the Secretary-General’s proposal containedin his report  we should bear in mind the needs andaspirations of small and developing countries  whichcomprise the overwhelming majority of the UnitedNations membership.Efforts should also focus on further strengthening ofthe role and capacity of the Organization in the promotionof development. In this regard  we welcome the inter-agency collaborative arrangements  which we feel havealready led to improved coordination and cost-effectiveness of the United Nations development agencies.In so saying  I should like to place on record the deepgratitude of the people of Bhutan for the vital role and8contributions of the various United Nations agencies in ourcountry’s development efforts. These agencies often play alead and coordinating role in such sectors of our nationaldevelopment programmes as health  education andinfrastructure. Indeed  it is the face of the United Nationsas a prime mover of development that the masses in manyof our countries most appreciate and cherish.Differences in perspective have prevented us fromarriving at a meaningful agreement on substantive issuesconcerning the reform of the Security Council. Sixty-fivelengthy meetings held by the Open-ended Working Groupon the question of Security Council expansion and reformhave yielded few results  and tangible proposals remainelusive.My country firmly supports the position of the Non-Aligned Movement on this matter  as reiterated in the FinalDocument of its twelfth Summit meeting  which wasconvened in South Africa earlier this month. Bhutan is ofthe view that the current permanent members have anobligation to be more responsive to calls for multifacetedreforms of the Council. It must be rendered more effectiveand transparent through democratization and theenlargement of its membership  both in the permanent andnon-permanent categories. New permanent members mustinclude countries that have the capacity to share greaterinternational responsibilities and reflect equitablegeographical representation. We believe that Japan  whoseapportionment of the United Nations regular budget willexceed 20 per cent by the year 2000  and India as adeveloping country which represents one sixth of humanity are two countries that deserve permanent membership in theSecurity Council. We remain convinced that the presenceof developing countries is all the more essential for thereason that they form the object of most actions of theCouncil.Before I conclude  my delegation wishes to express itsdeep sadness over the loss of human life and destruction ofproperty and infrastructure in the aftermath of the worstever floods in Bangladesh. While the people of Bangladeshbattle against this cruel act of nature  the people of Bhutanare one with them and have extended to them someassistance. As a least developed country  Bangladesh doesnot have the resources to alleviate the suffering of itspeople and to put itself on the road to recovery andnormalization. We are hopeful that the internationalcommunity will respond promptly and generously to theappeal of the Prime Minister and the Government ofBangladesh."
"28",1122,"BWA",53,1998,"Mr. President  allow me at theoutset to express great pleasure at seeing you preside overthe work of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.We are confident that under your able leadership the workof this session will be an unmitigated success. I can assureyou of the cooperation and support of my country’sdelegation throughout your stewardship of this session.Allow me also to pay a well-deserved tribute to ourindefatigable Secretary-General and his staff for the effortsthey are making  often under very trying conditions  to givemeaning and concrete expression to the lofty idealsenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Theydeserve the full support and cooperation of all MemberStates and their peoples.As we approach the next millennium  we are fullyconscious of the omnipresence of war and of the havoc itcontinues to wreak upon peoples in literally everycontinent of the world. It is true that local wars have sofar not posed a serious threat to international peace andsecurity  but by some accounts they have already killedand maimed more people than both world wars combined.And judging by the number of those who are killed inthem and other attendant consequences  these wars whatever their cause  are a living reality for those whofight in them and for the innocent people who are caughtin the cross-fire. The conclusion we can draw is that notall succeeding generations of humankind have beenspared the scourge of war in accordance with the promisemade over 50 years ago by the founding fathers of thisOrganization. In terms of human history  50 years is arelatively short time. It is  however  long enough to makethe judgement that present-day human beings  like theirpredecessors in history  have failed to unlearn the ways ofwar — or rather to acquire the skills to live with oneanother like good neighbours.The presence of war and conflict among and withinnations has often drawn a great deal of criticism to theUnited Nations  as if it had a magic wand to resolveevery problem brought to its doorstep. True  there is roomfor improvement in the performance and efficacy of theUnited Nations. Certainly  the genocide in Rwanda in1994 could have been avoided with more determinationand foresight.Unfortunately  in awarding themselves certainextraordinary powers  the framers of the Charter builtcertain imperfections into the Organization which haveproven to be serious encumbrances to its efficiency andeffectiveness on conflict resolution. So long as thisOrganization remains the creation of the nation-Statesystem with its in-built self-interest  it cannot be expectedto perform differently. But we can certainly improve itsdelivery system to acceptable levels. Notwithstanding theimperfections of the United Nations  its continued existenceis in the national interest of all Member States  whatevertheir claims to the contrary. Otherwise  Member Stateswhich felt they benefitted the least would long since havewithdrawn their membership. Member States shouldtherefore commit themselves to the payment of theircontributions to the budget of the United Nations when theyfall due  without any conditions.Ideally  the United Nations should have developedmachinery to address and avert conflict situations beforethey actually occur. However  in the world in which welive  the ideal and the real do not often dovetail. Preventivediplomacy should quickly be succeeded by robustpeacekeeping as soon as it is determined that a conflictsituation is not amenable to resolution through dialogue.Preventive deployment has been put to use successfully inthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  and theseparation of belligerent forces has also been put tosuccessful use to contain the otherwise explosive situationsin Cyprus and Lebanon.The African experience in peacekeeping has beenslightly different. In most cases  conflicts have smoulderedand festered to calamitous proportions on our continent asa result of international inertia — or should we call it“Africa fatigue”? Liberia  Sierra Leone  the Great Lakesregion and other cases are illustrative in this regard. AfricanStates are ready and willing to bear their fair share ofpeacekeeping operations on the continent  but they arecertainly lacking in logistic and financial wherewithal.While there is ample scope for improvement in Africanpeacekeeping capacity  Africa has over the years acquiredpractical experience both in the field and throughcooperation with other countries. Thus  Africa has arelatively sophisticated capacity to carry out peacekeepingresponsibilities.I must admit that it hurts my pride as an African tohear that African conflict situations dominate the agenda ofthe Security Council. This is a dubious honour  if indeed itis an honour at all. It must  however  be acknowledged thatAfrican problems are problems of the internationalcommunity. They are problems of the United Nations whose Charter is categorical in allocating primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of international peaceand security. That responsibility was bestowed in trust. Itcannot be shirked for political expediency in any part ofthe world. African conflicts deserve equal attention bythis Organization  to which all African States belong andpay their dues  however modest. They cannot be left tothe Africans alone to resolve.If I have devoted a great part of my address to therole of the United Nations in crisis management and inthe defusing of tensions  it is not because I am obliviousto other equally pressing issues of our times. Crises andtensions  by their very nature  presuppose a lack ofsecurity  movement of people and  very often  deep-rootedintolerance. Evidently  when people raise swords againsttheir neighbours  the humanness that is innate in allpeople is replaced by the bestiality that lies latent in everyperson. It is incomprehensible how the perpetrators ofacts of genocide and other serious crimes againsthumanity manage to live with their consciences or to leadnormal lives after such heinous criminal activities.The establishment last summer of the InternationalCriminal Court will  we hope  help to ensure thatperpetrators of acts of genocide  crimes against humanityand other inhuman acts will not go unpunished. TheInternational Criminal Court will also  we hope  act as adeterrent for those intending to commit such seriouscrimes. The conviction by the Rwanda Tribunal of twoleading personalities involved in acts of genocide inRwanda in 1994 has also served notice to would-beperpetrators of similar acts that the internationalcommunity can no longer tolerate their diabolical acts.Human rights abuse is equally intolerable andimmoral. Institutions dealing with human rights should beempowered to deal with the perpetrators of human rightsabuses with the full force of the law. Human rights abusehas been responsible for the bulk of the horrendousconflicts that have ravaged societies in all continentsthroughout this violent century. We therefore could notagree more with the Secretary-General when he says inhis annual report on the work of the Organization “If individual rights are not protected  the whole ofsociety suffers. Personal freedoms are howeverrendered largely meaningless by civil wars  or byeconomic  social or cultural deprivation — often indeed  by a combination of all these”. (A/53/1 para. 171)2Therefore  in this  the year of the fiftieth anniversaryof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  thecommunity of civilized nations to which we all belong mustreaffirm its commitment to the human rights idealsenshrined in the Declaration and to their determination tolive up to those ideals.Globalization and economic liberalization have broughtabout unprecedented expansion in world trade andcommerce  but they have also accentuated the imbalancesin international economic relations. The vast majority ofcountries  particularly in Africa  continue to facemarginalization in the world economy. The problem isfurther compounded by the fact that official developmentassistance has fallen to unprecedentedly low levels.In Africa  armed conflicts have impacted negatively ondevelopment prospects. Corruption has also been one of thebiggest obstacles to development. There is  however  reasonfor optimism. The majority of African countries haveinstituted reforms to achieve economic growth anddevelopment  including the application of soundmacroeconomic policies  good governance  the rule of lawand respect for human rights. They have taken seriousmeasures to introduce budgetary reforms  removerestrictions on current payments and restrain credit andmonetary expansion. Over the past few years Africa’seconomic performance has been on an upward trend. In1997 close to 60 per cent of the African countriesregistered growth rates in excess of their population growthrates  and about half of this number posted annualeconomic growth rates of more than 5 per cent.Africa  however  still needs active support andassistance from the international community. We clearlyrecognize that it is the primary responsibility of theAfricans themselves to reduce the marginalization of theircontinent from the world economy. But for Africa toachieve any tangible success and emerge from theconditions of poverty and underdevelopment a new type ofpartnership with the developed world is required to increasetrade and the continent’s share of global prosperity. Africancountries need improved access to world markets  greaterflow of foreign direct investment  technology transfer andan increase in official development assistance.The decline in official development assistance needsto be reversed. Similarly  external debt is a problemrequiring urgent attention. In fact  the debt burden continuesto be one of the main obstacles to economic growth anddevelopment. The new initiative adopted by the BrettonWoods institutions to reduce the multilateral debt of theheavily indebted poor countries is a welcomedevelopment  though its implementation has been verydisappointing and painfully slow. Botswana believes thatthe only viable solution to the debt problem faced by thepoorest countries is outright cancellation of the debt.The main objectives of Botswana’s developmentstrategy are employment creation and poverty alleviation.Lack of income is the most immediate cause of povertyamong our people. Employment opportunities haveincreased significantly in the last few years  but the rateof unemployment is still unacceptably high. To improvethe situation  Botswana has over the past few yearsundertaken measures to create a favourable environmentfor investment  including the encouragement of small andmedium-scale enterprises. I am confident that with thesupport of our development partners our efforts will bearfruit.Before I conclude my statement  let me say a fewwords about recent events in southern Africa. On 16September 1998 there was an attempt to put an end to theconstitutional order in the Kingdom of Lesotho byoverthrowing a democratically elected Government. Juniorofficers in the Lesotho Defence Force mutinied andarrested their senior officers  including the armycommander. Government employees  including CabinetMinisters  were stopped from going to work  whichresulted in a complete collapse of the administrative orderin the country. Criminal activity and lawlessness becamethe order of the day. There was no doubt that Lesothowas on the brink of widespread violence and total chaos.The crisis was most alarming because of its widerimplications for peace and stability in the wholesubregion of southern Africa. No effort was made bythose involved to heed the calls for peaceful dialogue.Under the circumstances  the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) could not remainindifferent. Therefore  on 21 September 1998 members ofthe Botswana Defence Force and the South AfricanDefence Forces entered the Kingdom of Lesotho inresponse to an appeal for such intervention by thedemocratically elected Government of Lesotho. Theintervention is aimed at assisting the people of Lesotho tocreate conditions conducive for them to address theirdifferences in a peaceful manner. Our action conformsstrictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter ofthe United Nations  as well as the resolution of the 1997Harare summit of the Organization of African Unitywhich condemns the overthrow of legitimate Governmentsby the military.3I wish to assure the Assembly that the militaryintervention by Botswana and South Africa in Lesotho ismotivated solely by a sincere will to establish conditions ofpeace and security in our sister country. We are dealingwith a difficult  complex and rapidly changing situation. Assuch  our forces shall remain in Lesotho for as long asnecessary to restore public order and the rule of law.With regard to Angola  it has become increasinglyclear that the leader of UNITA has no intention that it shallmeet its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol. Given therenewed upsurge in violence caused by UNITA  SADC hascome to the conclusion  regretfully  that Mr. Savimbi mustbe held personally responsible for war crimes that hismovement has committed  and continues to commit evenafter it has signed a peace agreement. The people of Angolahave suffered for far too long and it is time that thisfratricidal war  which has devastated the country  wasbrought to an end.Across the border from war-weary Angola  anotherSADC country is going through a painful process ofnational rebirth  rudely interrupted two months ago by arebellion which  even as we meet here  is ineluctablysapping the residual energy of a devastated country. Thepeople of the Democratic Republic of the Congo deserve abreak. Through the timely assistance rendered by threeSADC countries at a time of great peril  it is our ferventhope that the Democratic Republic of the Congo will soonresume its process of rebirth and do so in peace andtranquillity.Let me conclude by assuring you  Mr. President  andthe nations gathered here that Botswana’s faith in theUnited Nations as the universal repository of the hopes andaspirations of all mankind remains as strong as ever. Wewill continue to work assiduously for the enhancement ofthe efficacy of the Organization  to help equip it for thearduous tasks that lie ahead."
"29",1165,"CAF",53,1998,"I takepleasure in congratulating Mr. Opertti on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession  and I pledge my delegation’s full cooperation. Icommend his predecessor  Mr. Udovenko  for bringing thefifty-second session of the General Assembly to asuccessful conclusion. I take great pleasure in expressingmy pride in our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. Hisleadership and many achievements during the short periodof his tenure are highly commendable.Just as this session of the General Assemblycoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  it also coincides providentially  with the fiftieth anniversary of thecommencement of peacekeeping operations by the UnitedNations. These coincidences are striking because  whileone was envisaged in the Charter of our Organization andwas the subject of painstaking negotiations  the other wasa chance development  not having been envisaged in theCharter. Yet both have had a profound effect on theinfluence of the United Nations in global affairs and onthe perception of the Organization by those whom it wasestablished to serve and who were identified in theopening words of the Charter as “We the peoples of theUnited Nations”.The double celebration this year should also enableus to appreciate better the interrelationship betweenhuman rights and peacekeeping. There can be no questionof human rights being enjoyed in a situation of conflict.Put another way  conflicts create conditions for the mostoutrageous violations of human rights  since  contrary toall international law and rationality  the most vulnerablein society — children  women and the aged — are oftentargeted and deprived of the most basic of human rights the right to life. As we define and refine ourOrganization’s responsibilities in peacekeeping  which  bycommon consent  is now taken in its broadest sense tomean the prevention  management and resolution ofconflicts  let us always be conscious that the universalenjoyment of human rights  one of the major aspirationsof humanity  cannot and will not be achieved unless wedevote as much effort to the elimination of the conditionsthat provoke the violation of those rights.I believe that it is with this fact in mind thatinternational organizations  whether global  regional orsubregional  have been devoting considerable time todevising effective means of preventing  managing andresolving conflicts in their various area of competence. Ofcourse  the United Nations  with its unique role as theonly global Organization invested with authority for themaintenance of international peace and security  is appropriately  taking the lead in these efforts. Following“An Agenda for Peace” (A/47/277) and its supplement(A/50/60)  and at the request of the Security Council  the4Secretary-General presented to us at this session his reportentitled “The causes of conflict and the promotion ofdurable peace and sustainable development in Africa” document A/52/871. The report represents a verycomprehensive and incisive study of the causes of conflictin Africa. The recommendations therein  if implemented byAfrican countries as well as by the United Nations  couldreverse the pestilence of conflicts which are ravaging thecontinent.In this connection  my delegation would like tounderscore the role of the Security Council in dealing withAfrican conflicts. While the Organization of African Unity(OAU) has demonstrated a commitment to taking the leadin the resolution of conflicts on the continent  the fact isthat its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention  Managementand Resolution will take time and will require resources notimmediately available to Africa if it is to evolve to itsmaximum capacity. In the meantime  the efforts of thesubregional organizations  which are increasingly taking theinitiative in their various regions  need to be adequatelysupported by the international community.My country  the Central African Republic  has beenthe beneficiary of such an initiative  which was taken by agroup of African countries  to deal with the internalconflicts that erupted with three successive army mutiniesin 1996. The Inter-African Mission to Monitor theImplementation of the Bangui Agreements (MISAB)  whichwas composed of troops from Gabon  Chad  Burkina Faso Mali  Senegal and Togo  was given strong logistic supportby France. It operated in Bangui from January 1997 toApril 1998 as both a force of interposition and a guarantorto ensure the observance of the peace accord which wasbrokered by four African heads of State. My delegationwould like to pay very high tribute to the Presidents ofGabon  Burkina Faso  Chad  Mali  Senegal and Togo forthe great sacrifice they made in the interests of ourcontinent.I should also like to pay great tribute to France for itsinvaluable support of the African initiative. At the requestof my head of State  and with the agreement of the inter-African group  the Security Council graciously consented tosend a United Nations peacekeeping operation to replacethe inter African force.The United Nations Mission in the Central AfricanRepublic (MINURCA)  which commenced operations inBangui on 15 April 1998  is the first proactive missionestablished by the United Nations in Africa. It has beenmaking a major contribution to the restoration of lastingpeace and security in our country and has assisted thepeace-building efforts of the Government and the peopleof the Central African Republic. It is a practicaldemonstration of the incisive observation of ourSecretary-General  in his report entitled “The causes ofconflicts and the promotion of durable peace andsustainable development in Africa”  to the effect that“the deployment of a multidisciplinary peacekeepingoperation may well represent the best chance toestablish peace and build a foundation for lastingdevelopment  based on respect for human rights andthe rehabilitation of civic institutions.” (A/52/871 para. 37)A major step in the restoration of the institutions ofState in our country is the organization of a free  fair andtransparent legislative election. In his letter to theSecretary-General requesting the assistance of theinternational community in re-establishing peace andsecurity  my President  Mr. Ange-Félix Patassé  invitedthe United Nations  inter alia  to supervise the legislativeand presidential elections in the country. That request wasa measure of both the confidence which we have in theUnited Nations and our commitment to a transparentdemocracy built on the freely expressed will of ourpeople. I wish therefore to express my Government’ssatisfaction for the assistance of MINURCA in thepreparations for the legislative elections. We are lookingforward to the decision of the Security Council which willenable MINURCA to provide further assistance for theelectoral process  thus giving all Central Africans theassurance of the freedom  fairness and transparency ofthis most important aspect of the democratic process.Needless to say  United Nations assistance in theprocess is a worthwhile investment in good governance which itself is the sure foundation for peace  security anddevelopment. No effort should therefore be spared by ourOrganization in rallying to the support of those MemberStates that are making genuine efforts to instal a systemthat in itself constitutes a conflict-prevention mechanism.The cost of such support  which also constitutes aninvestment in peace-building  is in the end much less  andthe results more satisfying  than those of a fire-fightingresponse after the outbreak of a conflict.Bearing these factors in mind  I wish to appeal  onbehalf of my Government  to the Security Council to takea comprehensive approach that avoids a premature exit ofMINURCA  thus compromising the objective for whichthe Mission was installed in Bangui. My Government has5exerted itself to fulfil the commitments made by PresidentPatassé to transparency and accountability in his letter tothe Secretary-General requesting the presence of the UnitedNations in our country.One major result of those efforts was the positivejudgment of the Bretton Woods institutions which permittedthe conclusion last July of a long-sought accord onenhanced structural adjustment facility. Needless to say  thiswould not have been possible without the assurance ofsecurity given by the presence and the activities ofMINURCA.However  much remains to be done  and the presenceand cooperation of MINURCA will be indispensable forsuccess. Most important is the restructuring and retrainingof our security services  both civil and military. Thecommencement by MINURCA of the retraining of thevarious categories of our police and gendarmerie serviceshave already yielded some positive results  and thecontinuation of the programme  as is being done in otherUnited Nations operations in other parts of the world  willprove an invaluable legacy of United Nations peace-building efforts in our country.Africa should not be denied this benefit whichemanates from the reappraisal of the components ofcomprehensive United Nations peacekeeping operations.Civilian police training programmes have become anessential element of these operations  but they have notbeen known to commence and end in a period of ninemonths. An African situation cannot be presumed to bedifferent  particularly when it is in the region nowconsidered to be most prone to the phenomenon ofconflicts.Besides  the restructuring of our armed forces is beingcommenced with the involvement of MINURCA  whichwas given a role to play by Security Council resolution1182 (1998) of 14 July 1998. The joint committeeconsisting of representatives of the Government and ofMINURCA is to elaborate the legal instrument whichshould form the basis for our defence policy and armedforces  as well as a comprehensive programme for a widelyrepresentative  national  and well-trained force that will alsobe a useful instrument for development. The hope of myGovernment is that the Security Council will allowMINURCA sufficient time to assist us in theseindispensable peace-building endeavours. A withdrawal  asis being contemplated at this time  will not be in theinterest of my country or of the Central African subregion which is already in great turmoil. I cannot but recall onceagain the very pertinent observation of the Secretary-General in the report which he painstakingly compiled atthe request of the Security Council:“the deployment of a multidisciplinary peacekeepingoperation may well represent the best chance toestablish peace and build a foundation for lastingdevelopment  based on respect for human rights andthe rehabilitation of civic institutions.” (ibid.)"
"30",1211,"CAN",53,1998,"Allow me to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly. With your experience and dedication to thegoals of this Organization  you will guide us wisely andeffectively in our work this year.And important work it is  for as the century drawsto a close  our security is more precarious than ever. Thespectrum of threats is wide and growing. Traditionaldangers persist  including the proliferation of weapons.But new threats — terrorism  crime and drugs — arisefrom a world in which the face of conflict has changed.Economic and social insecurity for the majority of ourglobal population is on the rise. Increasingly  it is thewell-being of individuals that is directly at stake.(spoke in French)There is an urgent need for solutions. Theinterdependence of all of our lives is unprecedented. It isessential for us to work together to confront thesechallenges. This means working through a vibrant UnitedNations. For Canada  the universal values set out in theCharter have acted as our moral compass in setting ourglobal agenda. The United Nations system serves as theinstrument in achieving our goals.(spoke in English)At the same time we recognize that the UnitedNations faces its own worries  and it  too  must change.But a strong  reinvigorated United Nations is still the bestfoundation for the future. As the contours of that futureemerge  there is reason for hope. While old realities ofpower persist  a new system based on humanitarianstandards  practices and law based upon needs and humansecurity is beginning to show through.Perhaps this new reality can best be seen in thecommon effort to eliminate anti-personnel landmines. TheSecretary-General has hailed the adoption of the OttawaConvention as an unprecedented achievement — oneaccomplished through a unique partnership of non-governmental organizations  Member States andinternational groups working together to eliminate aweapons system that victimizes the innocent.23Last week  Burkina Faso deposited the fortiethratification of the treaty  thereby crossing the thresholdneeded to bring the treaty into force. This treaty  which hasalready attracted 130 signatories and 41 ratifications  willbecome part of the international legal framework as of 1March next year. We welcome the offer by Mozambique tohost the first meeting of the States parties to theConvention. We continue to urge those who have not doneso to sign and ratify the Convention and join in thisinternational endeavour.But entry into force is just the first important step inbringing the treaty to life. Now we have to meet thetreaty?s goals. An effective coalition for action must worktogether in this next phase to take the mines out of theground and to help the victims. The United Nations through its mine action service  will mobilize andcoordinate the efforts of the international community.At the signing of the treaty on landmines in Ottawalast December  countries pledged $0.5 billion for mineaction. My own Government has allocated $100 million asCanada?s contribution to rid the world of these very cruelweapons. We have already put the money to work in someof the most severely affected States  with projects inMozambique  Cambodia  Bosnia and Central America. Nowwe must put everyone?s resources to work.Landmines are not the only weapons that take a tragic disproportionate toll on civilian populations. Small armsand light military weapons — cheap and easy to transport smuggle or hide — have become the tools of choice forsmugglers  terrorists and criminals.The challenges arising from the proliferation andwidespread abuse of small arms and light weapons arecomplex. But the impact on all of us  especially the mostvulnerable  is direct and devastating. Eighty per cent of thevictims are women and children. There are no easysolutions and no shortcuts. We cannot  however  afford toshrink from facing such a pervasive threat to our security.In Canada we pursue a three-pronged approach  dealingwith the legal trade  illicit trafficking and peace-buildingchallenges of small-arms proliferation. We hope  byworking with others in the United Nations  to see the useof this terrible weapon come to an end.Illegal drug-trafficking also threatens our peoples?security. The drug trade affects governance  undermineshuman rights and promotes cross-border conflicts. That iswhy Canada has proposed a Foreign Ministers? dialoguegroup in the Americas. We hope that this will be a forumwhich can provide guidance and generate ideas to help uscurtail the collateral impact of the drug trade onGovernments and on society. These and other emergingthreats to our security  including terrorism  crime andenvironmental degradation  affect every one of us but arebeyond the reach of any of us alone. They demand global integrated solutions  which the United Nations is bestsuited to provide. The International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings  concluded last year ongoing work in developing a convention on transnationalorganized crime and the Kyoto Protocol to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change — allshow that we are capable of working together to enhanceour human security.Moving the human security agenda forward alsorequires that we redouble efforts to address the rootcauses of conflict and risk. Peace and stability areindispensable to security  but they are not  regrettably humanity?s birthright. They must be built. Two years ago we launched the Canadian Peace-building Initiative. Itsobjective is to address the unique challenges of societiesrecovering from conflict. Through this initiative  projectshave been undertaken in Guatemala to assist civil societyto implement the peace agreements  in Bosnia to promoteawareness of the peace accords  in Mozambique tosupport a programme to exchange weapons for farmingtools  and in West Africa to support the initiative led byMali to promote a West African arms moratorium. Theseare small steps  certainly  but constructive ones inworking locally to build peace.Today  I am pleased to release a report entitled“Peace in Progress”  which documents the resultsobtained to date and the wide range of partners withwhom we have worked. As the title suggests  Canadaintends to carry on with its partners in empowering thoseworking to build peaceful and stable societies in theirown countries.It has been a half-century since a distinguishedCanadian international civil servant  John Humphrey wrote the first draft of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights. Since then over 60 international humanrights instruments have been adopted. Countries haveshown a new and welcome willingness to cooperate withthe international human rights system.But we must build on that progress  and one of themost important ways that the Assembly can make itscontribution this year is to support a strong UnitedNations declaration on human rights defenders to protect24those who are protecting those whose human rights arebeing abused.(spoke in French)The growing integration of human rights  includingwomen?s rights  into all other aspects of United Nationsactivity is a recent and important breakthrough. On thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  the conditions exist to achieve progress in attainingthe goals set out by its drafters. This is good news.However  a review of the human rights situation around theglobe makes it painfully clear that we remain far short ofthese goals.We need to take advantage of the momentum that thisanniversary presents. The United Nations human rightssystem must be assured of both the political support of themembership and increased regular budget financing if it isto do the job we have entrusted to it.(spoke in English)The growth of intra-State conflicts caused bydifferences of religion  language  race or ethnicity hasreinforced the need to protect marginalized groups. To doso  both Governments and civil society must have readyaccess to information about human rights situations aroundthe world. To this end  Canada has launched for the recordan annual report drawn from United Nations sources  whichwe are making available on the Internet to provide constantupdated information concerning human rights around theglobe.Certainly  of those at risk from conflict  none are moreat risk than children. The targeting of children inwarfare — both as fighters and as victims — is intolerable.The ground-breaking efforts of Graça Machel and the workof the Secretary-General?s Special Representative forChildren and Armed Conflict  Olara Otunnu  merit specialand ongoing support.Enhancing human security also requires establishinglegal instruments. The agreement in Rome to establish theInternational Criminal Court is a major fundamental steptowards that goal. This Court will help to deter some of themost serious violations of international humanitarian law.It will help give new meaning and global reach toprotecting the vulnerable and the innocent. By isolating andstigmatizing those who commit war crimes or genocide andremoving them from the community  it will help end cyclesof impunity and retribution. Without justice there is noreconciliation  and without reconciliation there can be nopeace.We need to move forward urgently in making theCourt a reality. We should begin during this session ofthe General Assembly to bring the Court into operation.We who have supported the Court should ratify theStatute as soon as possible. We must also work tounderstand and address the concerns of those States thatremain hesitant about the Court — without diluting itseffectiveness. Ultimately  we must ensure that we have aninstitution that will be credible  responsible and effective.Respect for civil and political rights is necessary  butin itself is not sufficient to create the conditions for stablesocieties. Stability also requires economic and social well-being.Regrettably  statistics show that countries with thelowest income are much more likely to fall victim toviolent conflict than others. The number of people whosebasic human needs are not being met remainsunacceptably and dangerously high. A quarter of theworld?s people live in severe poverty; more than 800million face malnutrition; 180 million children under theage of 14 work as child labourers. As the United Nationshuman development index makes clear this year  the gapbetween the haves and the have-nots continues to grow.Countries overburdened by debt are less likely to bedeveloped and more likely to succumb to conflict.Reducing the debt of the least developed nations allowsthem to devote more resources to basic human needs.That is why at the summit of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) in Ouagadougou I announced a $20 millioncontribution to the African Development Bank to supportthe most heavily indebted African countries. That is alsowhy Canada has forgiven virtually all development-relateddebt owed to us by the least developed countries —almost $1 billion — and why we encourage others whohave not already done so to do likewise.I think we all recognize that globalization presentsopportunities  but it also exposes all of us  especially themost vulnerable  to greater economic and socialinsecurity. The international financial turmoil of the pastmonths vividly demonstrates the impact these crises canhave on the daily lives of the least fortunate. It meansthat we need to be sensitive to the social consequences offinancial volatility. And when crisis strikes  the UnitedNations and its specialized agencies have a specialresponsibility to assist those most severely affected.25There is no greater threat to our security than nuclearproliferation. In 1945  Canada  despite the experience of themost destructive war in history  decided to forgo thenuclear option even though  as a participant in theManhattan Project  we had the technical capability andmaterial capacity to build our own nuclear weapons. In1968  the Government of Canada confirmed that decisionand joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT). Every subsequent Canadian Governmenthas reaffirmed that commitment  and we have spent muchdiplomatic effort to persuade others that nuclear weaponsare the problem  not the solution.The non-proliferation regime has enhanced everyone?ssecurity. The credibility of that regime has been severelytested over the years  but particularly over the past sixmonths. India?s and Pakistan?s nuclear tests put the entirenon-proliferation regime in jeopardy. Nuclear testingundermines the basic goals and objectives of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Testing puts all of us  not least the people ofthe testing countries themselves  at greater risk. Therefore there can be no condoning these actions.And there must be no rewards. We must not legitimizethe claims of would-be nuclear Powers  or confer any newstatus on proliferators. We listened carefully to thepresentations of the Presidents of India and of Pakistan thisweek and we welcome the indications they gave that theywould sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.But it is important to reiterate that Security Councilresolution 1172 (1998) calls upon India and Pakistan to signthe Treaty without conditions  to participate purposefully inthe negotiations on a cut-off treaty on fissile materials  tostop the weaponization of their nuclear programmes  toimpose strict export controls on nuclear technology and toembrace fully the non-proliferation regime. We urge themto do so.In that spirit  we welcome India?s and Pakistan?sdecision to relaunch their dialogue on Kashmir. We alsorecognize that preventing horizontal proliferation  whilecrucial  is no more important than preventing verticalproliferation. Nuclear disarmament is the other half of thenuclear bargain. That bargain is a balance of responsibilitiesand obligations undertaken by nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon States alike. Not all nuclear-weapon Stateshave begun to fulfil their obligations under Article VI ofthe Non-proliferation Treaty  and we call upon them tofulfil their responsibilities.As we all recognize  this period of globalizationmultiplies the challenges. It is Canada?s conviction that adynamic  responsive and flexible United Nations systemis the best way  perhaps the only way  to meet thesechallenges.(spoke in French)To fulfil its leadership responsibilities  the UnitedNations must be assured of reliable and adequate funding.We cannot revitalize the United Nations so long asMember States  particularly the most wealthy andfortunate among them  contribute less to a system fromwhich they demand more. Renewal can be achieved onlyif Member States pay their assessed dues  present andpast due  on time and without conditions.(spoke in English)Let me now speak of the Security Council. TheSecurity Council remains at the centre of what the UnitedNations is all about: protecting against conflict and humanrisk. However  the Council?s legitimacy is increasinglybeing questioned. To remain credible  the Council mustre-examine traditional interpretations of its mandate. TheCouncil needs to broaden its horizons in addressingemerging threats which impact on our security. Thematicdebates on these issues  in which all Member States canparticipate  are a good step. The addition of peace-building to the Council?s range of responses to threats topeace and security is also welcome.But the Council must also be more willing and moreconsistent in both how and when it becomes involved.The Council belongs to all Member States. It cannot beallowed to focus on solving the problems of one regionand be indifferent to those of others.The way the Council does its work must be moreopen and more transparent. For example  Member Statesinvolved in and affected by matters before the Councilmust be allowed to exercise their Charter rights. Far fromconstraining the Council?s efficiency  this will improvethe decisions it takes and render its actions moreeffective. The trend for permanent members increasinglyto assume more control over the agenda  therebymarginalizing elected members  runs counter to thedemocratic principles which so inform our politicalinstitutions at the close of the twentieth century. Thedistinctions between permanent and elected members needto be narrowed rather than widened.26In sum  the Council we need for the next century mustbe more responsible  more accountable and lessimpenetrable. We hope that members will support Canadain advancing these aspirations."
"31",1272,"CHL",53,1998,"Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on behalf of theGovernment of Chile and in my personal capacity  onyour election as President of the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly  which represents a deserved tribute toyour political skills and diplomatic career  as well as arecognition of your country?s commitment to the work ofthe United Nations. It gives us very special pleasurebecause you are a national of Uruguay  a Latin Americancountry that is especially close to Chile  and with which in addition  we are cooperating closely in the Rio Groupand the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR).We also congratulate the Secretary-General on theleadership he has demonstrated since he took up hisduties. His vision of the necessary reform of thisOrganization  as well as his dedication to the solution ofimportant international problems  gives us greatsatisfaction. We encourage him to persevere in pursuit ofthe goals he has set himself.Globalization  interdependence and regionalintegration are phenomena that characterize present-dayinternational realities. The experience of many countries Chile among them  shows that greater participation in theworld economy  if appropriately channelled  can constitutea key element in the economic growth and prosperity ofcountries. Nevertheless  these phenomena  whose logicand dynamics are universal in scope  still offer ambivalentand contradictory lessons and meanings  depending ontheir magnitude and the effects they are causing in thedifferent parts of the world. It is obvious that this processgives rise to legitimate uncertainties and concern in thecontext of the financial upheavals that  having started inthe Asia/Pacific region  now affect the whole world. Theneed for more effective and concerted action by the maininternational economic Powers and the specialized22agencies to deal with these situations is becomingincreasingly apparent. The need to reshape the globalfinancial architecture is becoming ever more obvious.It seems clear that there is a need for greatercoordination regarding the international community?sinstitutional capabilities to deal with situations like thepresent one. The world has experienced similar situationsbefore  but they now take place in a context of muchgreater interdependence. This necessitates an in-depthreview of the current structures of the world financialsystem in order to adapt them to the new challenges ofinternationalization. Otherwise  we shall always bevulnerable to upheavals like the present ones  and tosetbacks in those parts of the world that are affected.Obviously  no agency of the multilateral system  on itsown and using only its own methods  is in a position tobring certainty and stability to the current crisis. In thesearch for solutions  we need to combine differentapproaches and concerns: financial order  growth ofinternational trade  effective social security networks promotion of investment and growth  and respect forworkers  among others. We have a great opportunity tograsp fully the integrated nature of these problems anddefine genuinely coordinated policies in order to solvethem. This is a task in which the entire internationalcommunity must participate. The Latin American countrieshave assumed their responsibilities for building soundeconomies with increasingly low levels of inflation progressively decreasing their budget deficits and reducingunemployment and indebtedness.What Chile has done in this respect is recognized  andhas been frequently praised in recent years. In little over adecade  Chile has doubled the size of its economy. Thisyear  1998  will be our twelfth year of uninterruptedgrowth. For eight years we have been constantly reducinginflation and unemployment  with a financial surplus andhigh domestic and external savings rates. All of this hastaken place in a context of great openness to the outsideworld and a regional integration process conducted with aview to promoting open regionalism. It has also taken placein the context of an increasing expansion of socialinvestment  whose benefits for the most vulnerable sectorsof the population are apparent in the high indicatorsachieved by Chile in this Organization?s latest HumanDevelopment Report.However  despite these significant achievements wehave also had to face in recent months problems that weshare with many countries in our region  stemming from theglobal financial crisis and the difficulties created in someof our main export markets. President Frei's Governmenthas adopted stringent adjustment measures in order toreduce public and private expenditure  avoid an upsurgeof inflation  and  at the same time  maintain socialinvestment and protect Chileans? jobs.This permits us — as the Heads of State andGovernment of our region did when they met on 5September at the Twelfth Rio Group Summit — to callon all to discharge their responsibilities in this respect  aswe have discharged our own. Our Presidents areconcerned about the possibility that the crisis will becomemore acute  and accordingly they urge the countries inwhich it arose to take the necessary measures to correcttheir imbalances; the countries of the Group of Seven totake action to restore the stability of financial markets andensure the growth of the world economy; and theinternational financial institutions to involve themselvesmore rapidly and effectively in resolving the crisis.There is also a need to prevent a mishandling of thecrisis or half-way measures leading to the reproduction oreven accentuation of the inequities that characterize thecurrent international system  which not only postponeaccess to progress and encourage despair  but also pose aserious and constant threat to international peace andsecurity.The emergence of a new worldwide awareness  theenlargement of the international agenda and the need todeal collectively with the problems of interdependenceprovide an impetus for the adoption of new internationalregimes. Examples of the progress achieved incooperative multilateralism include the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea  the Antarctic Treaty international humanitarian law  the Uruguay Roundagreements that led to the creation of the World TradeOrganization and the set of regimes relating to armscontrol and disarmament in general.Human rights have ceased to be an issue reservedexclusively for the sovereignty of countries  and havebecome a universal concern that no Government canignore. Protection of the environment has an undoubtedlyinternational dimension  in that issues as vital to ourfuture as climate change  pollution and over-exploitationof the seas  depletion of the ozone layer and the advanceof desertification all call for global treatment.The promotion and protection of human rights andfundamental freedoms constitute an inescapable23responsibility of the United Nations. The fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsand the fifth anniversary of the World Conference onHuman Rights  held in Vienna  constitute opportunities torenew our concern for and commitment to the values andprinciples embodied in the Declaration and the agreementsadopted at the Conference.For Chile  the universality of human rights meansassuming the intrinsic dignity of all inhabitants of theplanet  regardless of their culture  religion  social status ethnic origin  gender or traditions. Neither lack ofdevelopment nor cultural characteristics can be invoked tojustify limiting the human rights recognized in aDeclaration to which we have all subscribed. In thiscontext  the recently approved International LabourOrganization Declaration on Fundamental Principles andRights at Work and its Follow-up is an important stepforward in strengthening the basic rights of workersthroughout the world. This new international regime mustbe promoted by the entire multilateral system.A few days ago  I had the great honour of signing inRome  on behalf of my Government  the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court. Chile has committed itself toparticipate actively in the launching of the Court. Thisinstitution has been a long-standing aspiration  and manyrecent events have made it essential. It will contribute tothe strengthening of the international human rights regime the progressive development of international humanitarianlaw  the prevention of mass violations and the fight againstimpunity in cases of genocide or crimes against humanity.The subject of disarmament also continues to be oneof the most vital issues on the international agenda. Recentevents in this field  such as the nuclear tests carried out inSouth Asia  which my Government deeply deplores highlight the urgent need to enhance the validity anduniversal application of instruments such as the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). We musttake responsibility for the danger of nuclear proliferationand urge the parties concerned not to repeat such actions and we must renew our calls on all States to sign and ratifythe international instruments designed to eliminate thenuclear threat. Accordingly  we welcome Brazil?s recentaccession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.We must also make efforts to develop and improveour instruments for regulating the manufacture  trade anduse of conventional weapons. In this context  we areextremely pleased to know that the Treaty on theelimination of anti-personnel landmines has entered intoforce with the completion of the first 40 ratifications.Chile hopes to complete its process of legislative approvalshortly in order to be able to ratify this importantinstrument. For these same reasons  we adopted thismorning  together with other countries  a declarationsupporting the ad hoc group in its work to strengthen theverification and monitoring mechanisms of the BiologicalWeapons Convention.Chile strongly favours the process of establishingnew international regimes  whether regional or global  toconfront these and other challenges. The United Nationsplays a vital role in this field.The campaign against drug-trafficking and otherforms of organized crime can be truly effective only whenit takes place in a context of strong and genuine regionaland worldwide cooperation. Chile supports theimplementation of the decisions adopted at the twentiethspecial session of the General Assembly  on the worlddrug problem  decisions which can serve as a basis for acommon regulatory system and effective multilateralcooperation.The fight against international terrorism  which hasperpetrated such reprehensible acts this year  also requiresa much more effective international cooperation. Suchdramatic issues as the treatment of refugees andcombating hunger fall fully within the scope ofmultilateral activity. My country attaches great importanceto this function of our Organization. We believe that itmust continue to be expanded and intensified in the yearsto come. Of course  Chile is fully prepared to continueparticipating in this task.In the context of our participation in the UnitedNations  I wish to express my gratitude to the MemberStates  as well as to the employers? and workers? groupsof the International Labour Organization (ILO)  for thesingular confidence placed in Chile and its Ambassadorto the United Nations  Mr. Juan Somav'a  by electing himDirector-General of the ILO  beginning in March 1999.My Government wishes to express its profoundsatisfaction at having been a part of the Security Councilduring the biennium 1996-1997. In the exercise of theresponsibility entrusted to us by the internationalcommunity  my Government sought in every action ittook to contribute to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security and to fully assume the humanitarian24responsibility placed upon the Security Council in itsactivities.We have always believed that this responsibilityshould be manifested in the protection of the humanitarianworkers in conflict zones  in the ongoing presence of theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies subsequent tothe ending of hostilities so as to build peace effectively andin the focused application of sanctions that are adopted sothat they will not affect innocent civilians.Chile is convinced that the United Nationspeacekeeping forces can be identified as the Organization?smost effective mechanism for preventing and resolvinginternational conflicts. We are aware that peacekeepingoperations designed to take action in crises and conflictsbetween States have been faced with major challengesduring the present decade. Nevertheless  for all the well-known limitations  the experience built up over the pastthree years can be regarded as promising for the future.Many more human lives could be saved through UnitedNations peacekeeping operations  were we able tostrengthen them effectively. My Government wishes toexpress its firm resolve to continue cooperating  activelyand frequently  in the activities of this important instrumentof the Organization.Three years ago  when we celebrated the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  Member States assumeda commitment to unite our efforts to reform anddemocratize the structures of the Organization  with a viewto the new and complex challenges we shall have to face inan increasingly changing international scene. This sessionof the General Assembly has the task of taking upimportant pending aspects of that reform. The adoption ofresolution 52/12 constitutes an important first step down thelong road to reform.We are also encouraged by the changes that are beingintroduced in the Economic and Social Council. Theintroduction of new methods and programmes and theincorporation into its agenda of a segment on humanitarianaffairs will contribute to its renewal.The summits and conferences on economic and socialissues that have been held within the framework of theUnited Nations during the 1990s have reaffirmed ourOrganization?s priority commitment to development.Likewise  those events have provided conceptual tools andideas that are of great value for drawing up public policiesfor achieving economically  socially and environmentallysustainable development.The eradication of poverty must continue to be acentral objective. The same is true of the promotion ofhuman rights  gender equality and protection of theenvironment. It is essential that the General Assemblyconduct periodic reviews of the commitments made onthese issues at the summit meetings and conferences  asis to happen in the case of the International Conferenceon Population and Development  which is to be reviewednext June  and the Fourth World Conference on Women the review of which will take place in the year 2000.We also attach special importance to the specialsession of the General Assembly to be convened in theyear 2000 for the purpose of reviewing compliance withthe commitments of the Social Summit. Chile has had thehonour of presiding over the preparatory committee forthat special session. It is our hope that that meeting willbe able to conclude with the adoption of new initiativesat the national and international level that will allowfurther progress to be made in the process ofimplementing the agreements reached at the Summit.The process of reforming and democratizing theSecurity Council is one of the most important of themany objectives we have set ourselves in the context ofthe process of renewing the United Nations. The Councilmust reflect the new international realities. It needs to beenlarged to remedy  among other things  the unjustifiedunder-representation of the developing countries in thatbody.Nevertheless  the arduous process of reform in whichwe are engaged calls for broad-based majority support. Itwill be possible only with solid and substantiveconsensus. Frankly  we would prefer to sacrifice some ofthe urgency of such reforms rather than participate in adecision-making process which  lacking the support of thevast majority of members  could give rise to seriousdivisions between us.Furthermore  my Government believes thatenlargement of the Council  important though it may befrom the standpoint of enhancing its representativenessand legitimacy  is not of itself sufficient to endow theCouncil with the qualities required by its role as theguarantor of international peace and security. At the sametime  measures must be adopted with regard to itsworking methods  particularly in relation to transparency with which every one of its actions should be imbued andwhich should not be challenged.25We must stress the negative impact of the vetomechanism  which should be regulated and progressivelyreduced with a view to its gradual elimination in the longterm. A first step in this direction might be to amend theCharter so that the right of veto can be applied only toactions taken by the Council under Chapter VII.I should like to conclude by expressing our optimismwith regard to the future of the Organization. I hope thatthe Millennium Assembly  to which we have lent our fullsupport  will be the expression of a renewed and muchstronger United Nations as we enter the new century."
"32",1318,"CHN",53,1998,"I wish to congratulate Mr. Opertti on hisassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly atits current session. I believe that his wisdom andexperience will enable him to accomplish his importantmission with distinction.I would also like to express my appreciation for thecontribution made by Mr. Udovenko as President of theGeneral Assembly during the previous session.At present  the international situation is undergoingprofound changes. The accelerated trend towardsmultipolarity has injected new vitality into internationalrelations. Economic globalization is developing veryquickly  and countries are becoming increasinglyinterdependent. The development of multipolarity andglobalization has provided a stimulus to the readjustmentof international relations.Bilateral partnerships  mainly characterized by non-confrontation  non-alignment and non-targeting againstthird countries  have been established one after another.Various regional and intercontinental organizations ofcooperation have become more active than ever before.Such endeavours to seek the establishment of stable pragmatic and balanced international relations contributeto peace and development as well as to the establishmentof a fair and equitable new international political andeconomic order.10However  we cannot lose sight of the manyuncertainties still existing in the world.The nuclear arms race is a product of the cold war. Inthe post-cold-war period of today  the people of allcountries call fervently for the prevention of nuclearproliferation and endeavours for nuclear disarmament.It is to be regretted that last May India conductednuclear tests  going against the tide of the times  thusadversely affecting peace and stability in South Asia.Soon afterwards  Pakistan  too  conducted nucleartests. Their nuclear tests not only led to an escalation of thetension between the two countries  but also dealt a heavyblow to international nuclear disarmament and themechanism for the prevention of nuclear proliferation. Thishas aroused the great concern of the internationalcommunity. We hope that India and Pakistan will fullyimplement the Joint Communiqué of the five permanentmembers of the Security Council  as well as the provisionsof Security Council resolution 1172 (1998)  give up theirplans to develop nuclear weapons and immediately andunconditionally accede to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We appeal to India andPakistan to resolve the dispute over the issue of Kashmirthrough peaceful means.In our view  following the nuclear tests in South Asia the international community faces the pressing task ofconsolidating and strengthening the international non-proliferation mechanism to prevent further proliferation ofnuclear weapons and enhance the universality and authorityof the NPT.China has all along stood for the complete prohibitionand thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. Back in 1994 the Chinese Government proposed to the General Assemblythat a treaty on the complete prohibition of nuclear weaponsshould be concluded through negotiations. Furthermore  theChinese Government has on many occasions called on allthe other nuclear States to undertake not to use or threatento use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States andnuclear-free zones  has proposed the conclusion of aconvention on no first use of nuclear weapons throughnegotiations and has called for the early negotiation of afissile material cut-off treaty. China was active in thenegotiations on the CTBT and was among the first to signthe Treaty. Today  I would like to reiterate on behalf of theChinese Government that China will abide by theprovisions of the Treaty and has no intention of resumingnuclear testing. China will continue to pursue the policiesof unconditional no first use of nuclear weapons andunconditional no use or threat of use of nuclear weaponsagainst non-nuclear States and nuclear-free zones and willcontinue to support the Conference on Disarmament inGeneva to negotiate and conclude a non-discriminatoryand verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty on the basisof the agreed mandate. China urges the countries with thelargest nuclear arsenals to accelerate their nucleardisarmament process. As to the question of the ultimatecomplete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclearweapons  China  as a nuclear State  will never shirk itsresponsibility.The East Asian financial crisis that broke out in July1997 has caused a sharp decline in the economies ofmany countries of the region. Its negative impact is stillspreading. The drastic devaluation of the Japanese yensince last June has added to the difficulty of economicrecovery in the region.The crisis occurred in the overall context ofeconomic globalization  and its impact is being felt acrossthe world. Stepping up international cooperation andputting an early end to this crisis is not only in theimmediate interests of the East Asian countries  but alsoin the interests of the international community as a whole and especially of the developed countries. We hope thatthose developed countries with important influence on theregion’s economy will shoulder their responsibilities andtake active  resolute and effective measures to make theirdue contributions to safeguarding the stability of thefinancial order and promoting the recovery anddevelopment of the region’s economy.Following the eruption of the East Asian financialcrisis  the Chinese Government has taken a highlyresponsible attitude. China has rendered assistance to thecountries concerned within the framework arranged byInternational Monetary Fund and  at the same time through bilateral channels. Proceeding from the overallinterests of maintaining the stability and development ofthe region  China has made the decision not to devaluethe yuan renminbi  for which we have endured greatpressure and paid a heavy price. Now  despite thegrowing pressure and risk facing us  our decision tomaintain the stability of the yuan renminbi will remainunchanged.Fighting with one heart and one mind  we won thebattle against the disastrous floods. We have taken aseries of measures to deepen our reform and expand11domestic demand so as to ensure the sustained growth ofour economy and achieve the objective of an 8 per cent risein this year’s gross domestic product. We firmly believethat with the common efforts of the countries in the regionand of the rest of the international community  the EastAsian economy will be able to gradually get out of itspredicament and return to the road of sound development.The Middle East peace process has been in a stalematefor some time  which has aroused widespread concern inthe international community. We are of the view that theArab nations and Israel should hold earnest and pragmaticnegotiations so as to achieve a comprehensive  just andlasting peace  which will be not only in the fundamentalinterests of the Arab and Israeli peoples  but also conduciveto world peace and stability. We hope that all the partiesconcerned in the Arab-Israeli disputes will take a flexibleand pragmatic position to promote steady progress in thepeace negotiations under the principle of land for peace andon the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions andthe agreements already reached. The Chinese Governmentwill  as always  support the Middle East peace process andthe efforts made by the United Nations and the relevantparties to this end.We are following the developments in the Kosovoregion of Yugoslavia with concern. It is our hope that theparties involved will solve the problem through politicaldialogue. The sovereignty and territorial integrity ofYugoslavia should be respected. Peace and stability in theBalkans have been hard won and should be cherished allthe more by the relevant parties and by the internationalcommunity.The border conflicts between Ethiopia and Eritrea andthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo areanother source of concern for us. It is hoped that they willbe appropriately resolved by the parties involved throughpeaceful means.The twenty-first century is greeting us. On thethreshold of the new century  the United Nations bearsheavy responsibilities with regard to maintaining worldpeace  promoting human progress and establishing a justand rational new international political and economic order.It has an irreplaceable role to play. Above all  after the endof the cold war  the United Nations  with fewer constraintsand more vitality  is confronted with unprecedentedopportunities. In this context  the United Nations should andcan use its own advantages to play a unique andconstructive role in building a peaceful  secure and stableworld  in establishing a new type of internationalrelationship based on friendship and cooperation and intaking up the common challenges facing mankind.China has consistently held that it is necessary tocarry out appropriate reform in the United Nations so thatthe Organization can better keep abreast of the changingsituation and serve its numerous Member States. We havetaken note of the initial progress of United Nations reformin a number of fields promoted by all Member States.Some reform measures and recommendations proposed bythe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  have beenapproved by the General Assembly and are now being putinto practice. Intense discussions on reform of theSecurity Council are also in orderly progress. At present there are still differences among Member States on quitea few issues involved in the reform of the SecurityCouncil. We hope that all parties will adopt a constructiveapproach and play an active part in the relevantconsultations with a view to reaching a proper settlementof relevant issues.Here  I wish to reiterate the basic position of theChinese Government on these issues. First  the reform ofthe Security Council bears on the interests of all countriesand so requires a democratic style of work and extensiveand full consultations. All Member States should have anequal right to speak on the question of the reform  andtheir reasonable proposals should be fully reflected.Secondly  the Security Council is not a club of richcountries. The purpose of its reform is not just to meetthe concerns of a few big countries. Rather  moreattention should be given to the interests and aspirationsof the vast number of developing countries.Representation should be balanced between the developedand the developing countries.Thirdly  the reform measures are of majorsignificance  as they bear on enhancing the role of theSecurity Council in maintaining international peace andsecurity. They should be worked out on the basis of therealities and in the light of history. It is a matter of coursethat the objective of the reform of the Security Council isto solve problems rather than to create new sources ofdiscord. In order to ensure that the reformed SecurityCouncil gains extensive support from Member States  itis essential to adhere to the principle of consensus.This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of theadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.In the past 50 years  the Declaration has vigorouslypromoted the advancement and development of the cause12of human rights in the world. Vast numbers of people inAsia  Africa and Latin America freed themselves fromcolonial rule. The South African people rooted out the darksystem of apartheid  won basic political rights and becamean equal member of the international community. TheUnited Nations  for its part  adopted a series of internationalinstruments on human rights such as the Declaration on theRight to Development  further enriching the content ofhuman rights. The right to development has beenuniversally recognized in the international community as aninseparable part of basic human rights.In the meantime  earth-shaking changes have takenplace in China. Especially in the past two decades  since theintroduction of reform and opening up  China has witnessedan ever-improved practice of democracy  an ever-improvedlegal system and ever-enhanced legal protection of therights of its people. It is perfectly obvious that the Chinesepeople now enjoy a higher degree of freedom and equalitythan ever before and a much fuller and more settled lifethan in the past. The Chinese Government will continue tomake unremitting efforts to advance democracy and tostrengthen the legal system  while developing the economyso as to better ensure that its people enjoy human rights tothe full.The Chinese Government is active in supporting andparticipating in the activities of the United Nations in thefield of human rights. China has all along stood forinternational cooperation in the field of human rights on thebasis of equality and mutual respect  so as to enhanceunderstanding  narrow differences  expand common groundand strengthen cooperation through dialogue. The ChineseGovernment is ready to engage in dialogue  exchanges andcooperation  on the basis of equality and mutual respect with human rights organizations at the national andinternational levels.Last October  the Chinese Government signed theInternational Covenant on Economic  Social and CulturalRights. As to the International Covenant on Civil andPolitical Rights  I earnestly declare here that the ChineseGovernment has decided to sign it early next month. Thisonce again testifies to the resolve of the ChineseGovernment with respect to promoting and protectinghuman rights. China is ready to continue to work with othercountries to maintain and increase the current positivemomentum of dialogue and cooperation so as to promotethe furtherance of the world cause of human rights.This year is the twentieth anniversary of theintroduction of the policy of reform and opening up inChina. In these two decades  China has scoredtremendous achievements in its reform  opening up andmodernization drive. Particularly in recent years  ournational economy has gained a favourable momentum ofhigh growth and low inflation  thanks to deepenedreforms and strengthened macroeconomic regulation. LastSeptember  the Communist Party of China  at its fifteenthNational Congress  formulated a blueprint for China’scross-century development based on the newdevelopments both on the domestic and internationalscene. In March this year  our new State institutions andnew Government were formed through elections at thefirst session of the ninth National People’s Congress ofChina. We will build energetically on our political andeconomic restructuring and carry forward the cause ofbuilding socialism with Chinese characteristics into thetwenty-first century in a comprehensive way.China’s modernization drive requires a stableinternational environment of peace. China will continue topursue its independent foreign policy of peace. Thispolicy is sustained by three pillars: to persist inindependence and maintain the initiative  to safeguardworld peace  and to seek common development.To persist in independence and maintain theinitiative  we always put our State sovereignty andnational security first and never develop relations withother countries at the expense of our own sovereignty.Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s sacredterritory. The successful return of Hong Kong and theupcoming return of Macao will undoubtedly provideuseful inspiration and create favourable conditions for thesettlement of the Taiwan question. We will  as always adhere to the basic policy of peaceful reunification andone country/two systems; adhere to President JiangZemin’s eight-point proposal on developing cross-Straitrelations and promoting the process of peacefulreunification of the motherland; expand cross-Straitexchanges and cooperation in various fields; andresolutely oppose the creation of the “independence ofTaiwan”  “two Chinas” and “one China/one  Taiwan” andTaiwan’s attempt to re-enter the United Nations.We respect the sovereignty of other countries andvigorously support the efforts of all countries in theworld  and of developing countries in particular  to defendtheir State sovereignty  while firmly safeguarding ourown. In handling international relations  we adhere tonon-alignment  non-confrontation and the non-targeting ofThird States. We do not go in for military blocs and the13arms race  nor do we engage in military expansion. China’sdevelopment will not pose a threat to any other country.The so-called “China threat” is entirely unfounded andfabricated with ulterior motives.To safeguard world peace  China is a staunch force forthe maintenance of world peace and regional stability. It isour consistent view that State-to-State relations should behandled in a spirit of mutual respect and peacefulcoexistence  transcending differences in social systems andideologies. Countries should safeguard their own interestsand  at the same time  respect those of others andcontinuously expand mutually beneficial cooperation byseeking the convergent points of common interests. Withregard to existing differences and disputes  it is necessaryto persist in dialogue  not engage in confrontation  andstrive to settle them by peaceful means rather than byresorting to force or the threat of force.It is essential to completely reject the mentality of thecold war  advocate a new security concept and resolveinternational and regional security issues through consensusand participation on an equal footing. We in China standfor the equality of all countries  big or small  and foraccelerated democratization of international relations. Worldaffairs should be handled through consultation by allcountries  and no country should impose its own will onothers.To seek common development  peace is theprerequisite of development and development is the basis ofpeace. In today’s world  where the economy is increasinglyglobalized  countries must pursue an open policy in orderto achieve economic growth. Opening up to the outsideworld is China’s long-standing basic State policy. As ahuge emerging market  China will strive to keep abreast ofthe trend of economic globalization and be even moreactive in opening up to the world. It is ready to developtrade and expand scientific and technological exchangeswith all countries on the basis of equality and mutualbenefit and in the interest of common progress. It attachesimportance to and actively participates in the activities ofthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC)and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and sets store by theestablishment and development of friendly exchanges andcooperation with other global and intercontinental orregional organizations for economic cooperation.China continues to take a positive attitude towardsjoining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Thanks tounremitting efforts over a decade  China is already qualifiedfor entry. Regrettably  however  the relevant negotiationshave dragged on and on with no decision having beenmade. China is a developing country  and we cannegotiate China’s entry into the WTO only on this basis in accordance with the principle of balancing rights andobligations. It is our hope that the countries concernedwill take a practical  fair and flexible attitude  give upexcessive demands and work for an early conclusion ofthe relevant negotiations. China’s joining the WTO willbenefit all its members and make the multilateral trademechanism complete and more balanced.Before I conclude my speech  please allow me touse the forum of the United Nations to brief you onChina’s flood-fighting and disaster-relief efforts. Owingto such factors as abnormal climate changes this year catastrophic floods swept along the Yangtze  Nenjiang Songhua and other rivers of China. The sheer size of thesubmerged regions  the duration of the floods and theseriousness of the disaster they caused were somethingrarely seen before. Giving top priority to the protection ofpeople’s lives and their safety  the Chinese Governmentmobilized forces from all sectors across the country andorganized millions of soldiers and civilians for an all-outbattle against the floods and for disaster relief. Thus  theassaults of flood crests were repelled again and again; thesafety of the main dykes  the main transport arteries andmajor cities along the rivers was ensured; and the loss oflife and property was kept to a minimum.At present  the Chinese Government is sparing noeffort to resettle the people affected by the flood and hasstarted reconstruction projects in the disaster areas. Weare taking every measure possible  with full confidence to ensure that there will be no famine and no widespreadepidemic diseases in the wake of the natural disaster andthat none of the pupils or students in the flood-hit areaswill drop out from school or be deprived of education. Inthe course of reconstruction  we will carry forward thegreat flood-fighting spirit in an all-round endeavour topush forward our reform and opening up and the socialistmodernization drive.Since China was hit by the disastrous floods  anumber of countries and international organizations andcommunities have sent messages to express sympathy andsolicitude  and rendered support and assistance to China.I wish to take this opportunity to extend  on behalf of theChinese Government and people  our most sinceregratitude to them.The world of today is a world of interdependence.The promotion of peace  cooperation and development has14become the main trend of the times. Let us join hands andwork together to bring into the twenty-first century a worldof peace  security and stability in the interest ofdevelopment."
"33",1352,"CIV",53,1998,"Allow me  Mr. President  to offer you mywarmest congratulations on your unanimous election toguide the work of the fifty-third session of the GeneralAssembly. The honour bestowed upon you attests to thegood relations which your country  Uruguay  has forgedover the decades with the nations that make up theinternational community. The noble task which awaitsyou  far from being merely prestigious or simply one ofprotocol  frequently proves to be both delicate anddifficult.It involves presiding over the most eminent forum ofdebate for world affairs during a period in which  invarious places  one crisis follows another  such thataround the world neither peace nor war prevails. I amconvinced that your talents as a diplomat  your passionfor peace and development and your enthusiasm will33serve you well in dealing with the most complex debatesand the most tangled webs of procedure. Rest assured thatour best wishes will be with you throughout this session which  we feel sure  under your expert presidency  will becrowned with success.I wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor  H. E.Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine  for the remarkable way inwhich he guided our work in the last session and for thepersonal touch with which he ensured and improvedcoordination between the main bodies of the UnitedNations. We feel certain that in his parliamentary career inhis country he will display the same efficiency and skill heshowed in this forum. Finally  allow me to pay an emphatictribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who through his tireless commitment  has been able to restoreconfidence in our Organization and make it anincomparable instrument for international relations.I wish to hail his efforts to bring peace to the world and particularly to Africa  and the special attention he givesto the economic and political situation on our continent. Ialso wish to take this opportunity  on behalf of mydelegation  to congratulate him sincerely on his excellentreport on the work of the Organization  the clarity andconciseness of which will be very useful in inspiring ourdebate during the fifty-third session.During the past year  the world has entered a phase ofdifficulties and uncertainties such as it had not seen foralmost a decade. The crisis born in the most dynamiceconomies of South-East Asia has gradually reached otherregions. Today it seems to threaten all the countries of theplanet  from the richest to the poorest.This shows very well the extent to which thephenomena of globalization and interdependence amongStates and peoples have spread. No country  no matter howprosperous  can now hope to escape a crisis such as the oneSouth-East Asia has suffered and continues to suffer whichnow threatens other regions. This shows that the fight fordevelopment and the struggle against poverty concern all ofus.Emergent economies  which are paying the price of acrisis that  over these last months  has thrown tens ofmillions of people back into poverty and insecurity  areintegral parts of a sort of a global economic and financialpuzzle. The jolts these economies are experiencing weakenthe whole system.This risk  which everyone can see is real  shouldlead us to reconsider our traditional notion of the divisionbetween countries of the North and of the South. Weshould not  of course  ignore here the gulf between Northand South or challenge the existence of the distinct formsof poverty that make for starkly different conditions ofexistence  and even survival  for the most destitutepeoples of the industrialized countries and those of thedeveloping countries.What  on the other hand  is more and morequestionable with the advance of globalization is the ideaof a possible divergence of destinies  which could leadsome countries â€” the wealthiest â€” to continue theirmarch forward  while leaving the poor ones â€œalong theside of the roadâ€  to quote a popular phrase.The crisis we have been witnessing for a year nowshould convince us that there is a common destiny whichbinds together all Governments and all peoples of theplanet. The latter  whether they are richer or poorer  arebound by the same necessity â€” that of progressingtogether along the path of development. The current crisisshows us another vital need â€” that of solidarity  forwhich multilateral cooperation is the prime instrument.The United Nations must once again become the naturalvehicle of this multilateral cooperation. Unfortunately  wemust note that this notion of solidarity  which has becomean agreed formula in official declarations  is acted uponless and less in any concrete way.We recall the famous objective â€” which a fewdecades ago seemed quite modest â€” of establishing thedesirable level of official development assistance at 0.7per cent of gross national product of industrializedcountries. In noting  as the Secretary-General has done inhis report on the work of the Organization  that officialdevelopment assistance has been steadily decreasing fora decade and today represents only 0.22 per cent of thegross national product of industrialized countries  we mustrecognize that this call for solidarity is reachingincreasingly deaf ears in international forums.Along the same lines  I would like to stress that thestrategies for development debated and agreed amongGovernments  as well as the decisions adopted at themajor United Nations conferences  so far have not beenimplemented to the desired extent  due to insufficientfinancing. The mid-term evaluation of the outcome of theRio Conference on Environment and Development was inthis respect quite revealing of the present financial limitsfor aid to development. An effort commensurate with the34problem would allow us to radically change its basicelements.The 1998 Human Development Report  published bythe United Nations Development Programme a few weeksago  makes some significant comparisons. It shows  forexample  that Americans annually spend $8 billion oncosmetics â€” $2 billion more than the amount needed tofinance basic education for a large part of the worldpopulation. To quote the Secretary-Generalâs report on thework of the Organization â€œa bridge must be constructed between  in effect  theDow Jones index and the human development indexâ€(A/53/1  para. 15).We expect also that a new drive towards cooperationand development will not only combat poverty andexclusion but also promote international peace and security.Conflicts frequently have social and economic roots and this dimension should be fully integrated into theapproaches devised by the international community in theareas of conflict prevention  peacekeeping and post-conflictpeace-building.I wish to reiterate  and express the support of CÃ´tedâIvoire for  the proposal made by the Secretary-General inparagraph 30 of his report on the work of the Organizationto better use the possibilities of Article 65 of the Charter ofthe United Nations  which provides that the Economic andSocial Council may furnish information to the SecurityCouncil upon a request from the latter.With the exception of very limited applications in1949 and 1959  this provision of the Charter has not beeninvoked. Because it is based on fraternity  dignity andequality between peoples and States  solidarity needs to bethe cardinal value in the new world that is emerging fromthe ideological battlefields of the past.Progress in communications technology has todaybrought people closer than ever. Stepping outside of theirown cultures  men and women can experience the sameevents at the very same moment. They are upset andshocked by the pictures and consequences of a naturaldisaster or a terrorist attack. They are impassioned by thesame sports events and are reduced to tears by exceptionalevents such as the liberation of Nelson Mandela or the fallof the Berlin Wall  which give true ethical significance tothe evolution of humankind.During the past decade  we have witnessedspectacular progress  in almost all countries  with respectto the positive values that cement solidarity betweenpeoples. Almost all societies are now open and receptiveto pluralism. Every day I see that the peoples of theAfrican continent are hungering for participation. Theywish to have their say in national matters and to take theirfuture into their own hands.Throughout the world  civil society is making itsclaims and aspirations felt. Everywhere Governments  tovarying degrees  are becoming aware of this extraordinarychange and  in the context of diverse political formulasand variable schedules  they are acceding to the demandsof the people with respect to democratization.This new global focus on human rights andpluralism is reflected increasingly in the internationalorder. Buttressed by the non-governmental organizations Governments have decided to ban barbaric weapons suchas anti-personnel landmines  whose principal victims arecivilians  especially children. The broad and massivesupport given by the international community to theOttawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnelMines and on Their Destruction  which has been signedby 128 States and which will enter into force after thedeposit by the fortieth State of its instrument ofratification  allows us to hope for success in the effortsundertaken to fight against another scourge â€” small armsand small-calibre weapons â€” which affects mainlycivilians and foster criminality and insecurity.Global progress on the ethical level is evident alsoin the adoption in July 1998 of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court  thus enshrining the progressbegun by the international criminal tribunals for theformer Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. In this respect  thefirst judgments  handed down on 2 September last  havea dual significance. Fifty years after its adoption by theGeneral Assembly  the Convention on the Prevention andPunishment of Genocide has now seen a concretecontinuance: the appalling crime of genocide  repeatedlycarried out since 1945  will no longer go unpunished. Thesecond positive element of the judgments rendered by theArusha Tribunal is the recognition that sexual violencecommitted systematically and on a broad scale in thecontext of conflicts meets the definition of the crime ofgenocide.Another concern for my Government is the scourgeof terrorism  a true hydra-headed menace that is blindly35attacking in places where we least expect it. It is no longerenough to forcefully condemn this evil; we must try toextirpate its roots as it stems  with rare exceptions  frominjustice or the intolerable humiliation of peoples. The fightagainst terrorism is first and foremost a fight againstinjustice in all its forms. CÃ´te dâIvoire reiterates itssympathy for those States that have fallen victim to bombattacks. It reasserts its commitment to work in the contextof cooperation with all States to eradicate these crimes which cannot be justified regardless of their motivation.The time has come  as was stated at the Non-AlignedMovement Summit in Durban  to convene an internationalconference dealing with all aspects of terrorism that wouldlead to a convention allowing us to eradicate this scourge.To strengthen cooperation for development andpromote democratization and pluralism are the two focalpoints for the action which the international communityshould take in order to allow peace and security toprogress  which is the fundamental mission of ourOrganization.This concern falls in line perfectly with the objectivesof the Government of CÃ´te dâIvoire  which  under theleadership of our President  Henri Konan BÃ©diÃ©  iscommitted to relaunching strong  sound and lastingeconomic growth and to forge  in a spirit of solidarity  amore united  homogenous society based on participatory peaceful democracy.At the political level  the cabinet reshuffle that tookplace on 11 August last resulted in greater openness and innew political blood. At the institutional level  severalmeasures were adopted aimed at broadening and deepeningthe regionalization and decentralization process.Moreover  constitutional reform is being undertaken inorder to establish the rule of law  to consolidate Statestructures and strengthen representative democracy. Thelatter has given rise to the creation of a Senate  which willhelp us to strengthen the democratic debate and give us amore balanced representation of the regions.At the economic level  let me stress that in 1997 â€”and for the third consecutive year â€” the rate of growth ofour countryâs gross national product was 7 per cent. Thatrate  I would underscore  is higher than the demographicrate of growth of 3.8 per cent. Inflation was controlled at5 per cent in 1997  whereas the rate of investment was 15per cent of the gross national product  70 per cent of whichwas private investment.It is noteworthy that the management of the Alliancefor Africaâs Industrialization  which held its first meetingon 17 and 18 September last in Abidjan  reaffirmed thatindustrialization is a necessity for the economic progressof Africa and is the only means of transforming itseconomy in order to integrate it positively into the currentcontext of globalization.Africa will continue to rely for its industrialdevelopment on its partners from friendly countries. Wewish here to welcome the initiative of the Government ofthe United States on partnership and economic growth inAfrica which aims particularly to allow a number ofAmerican products access to the American market.We wish also to express our gratitude to theGovernment of Japan for its continuing commitment tothe development of Africa  as evidenced by the upcomingInternational Conference on African Development(TICAD II)  set to take place in Tokyo in October.We also wish to congratulate and thank all theGovernments of the donor countries that have forgivendebts to the African countries  especially the leastdeveloped ones.On the social level  I wish to take a moment tomention some points relating to health  a vital element insocio-economic development. Action in the field ofhealth  as the Assembly knows  contributes effectively tothe fight against poverty. CÃ´te dâIvoire has thereforemade this an absolute priority for several decades. Awarethat our world has become a global village  we havetirelessly pursued these efforts within our country  whileputting more and more effort into the promotion of healthat the international level.Several important recent events prove thiscommitment: the participation of President Henri KonanBÃ©diÃ© as the representative of our continent at the fiftiethanniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO); theadoption by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) lastJune of two resolutions proposed by CÃ´te dâIvoire  onerelating to the African fund to combat AIDS and the otheron the African initiative to fight against malaria; and thelaunching of the initiative on anti-retrovirus treatments for which CÃ´te dâIvoire has been selected as one of thecountries participating in the experimental phase. In orderto better mark our commitment to the success of thisprogramme  we have decided to allocate the sum of$1 million to it.36Moreover  CÃ´te dâIvoire organized a regional meeting attended by the Presidents of Benin and Ghana  to promotepublic awareness of  and the struggle against  Buruliâsulcer  a little-known but degrading and destructive illness.The multiplicity of conflict situations in Africa hasbecome a real subject of concern for the entire internationalcommunity. Hence the Security Council met on 25September 1997 at Foreign Minister level to consider theneed for concerted international action to promote peaceand security in Africa. At the end of that meeting  theCouncil asked the Secretary-General to submit to it byFebruary 1998 a report containing concreterecommendations regarding the sources of conflict inAfrica  way to prevent and address them  and how to laythe foundation for durable peace and economic growth.In response to this Security Council request  theSecretary-General prepared an excellent report entitled â€œThecauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace andsustainable development in Africaâ€ (S/1998/318)  whichgives a straightforward assessment of the political andeconomic situation in Africa and makes objectiverecommendations  while indicating the mistakes made byAfrican leaders and the shortcomings in internationalcooperation in this area.The report essentially always takes us back to theprimary mission of our Organization: the maintenance ofpeace  and the principal instrument for this  which iscollective security. The latter remains at the heart of theUnited Nations Charter. The original idea  it should beremembered  was that in the modern world  any conflict whether regional or local  could affect the whole ofinternational society  and that through alliances andinterventions it could well spread  with all the devastatingconsequences imaginable.It is in order to guard against these situations and toprovide every means to react to them that the 1945 Charter in Chapter VII  takes account of the regional character ofcollective security. The regional mechanism is intended toprovide continuity and to strengthen the action of theinternational community in the maintenance of peace without in any way challenging the primary role of theSecurity Council  which  duly informed of the initiativesundertaken by States bound by regional agreements  is theonly body which can authorize the use of force.It is in this spirit  and always taking care to refer firstto the Security Council  that the system of regional securityhas always functioned  be it in Africa or in Europe  eventhough with the involvement of the Atlantic Alliance inthe former Yugoslavia the situation was somewhatdifferent.The end of the cold war  with a backdrop of changein the general international security situation and anincreasing will by the great Powers to limit themselves tointerventions in the context of the United Nations  hasundoubtedly contributed to the reactivation of regionalsecurity. What was at stake  we must agree  was the verysurvival of certain regions of the world  prey to violentupheavals and mostly abandoned to their own fate.Regrettably  this is the picture which we see in an Africatorn apart by conflicts whose scope and gravity theinternational community does not always grasp.These are the realities which were in the minds ofMinisters of Foreign Affairs  Defence  the Interior andSecurity of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) when they met recently inYamoussoukro  CÃ´te dâIvoire  and then in Banjul Gambia  to lay the foundations of a mechanism for theprevention  management and resolution of conflicts andfor the maintenance of peace and security. The resultingtext  reached by consensus at the level of experts  willsoon be submitted for adoption by the conference ofheads of State and Government scheduled for the end ofOctober in Abuja.West Africa has plenty of experience in thisconnection  since in recent years it has had to mobilizetwice in order to settle two bloody conflicts in Liberia followed by Sierra Leone  and has thus acquiredconsiderable resources under the flag of the ECOWASMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). The success of theorganization in carrying out such interventions promptedit to institutionalize ECOMOG as its armed mechanism which is mainly preventive. This is a big step forward forECOWAS  originally created as a specialized subregionalorganization with the goal of promoting economiccooperation and eventually the integration of its memberStates.This subregional mechanism will of course becomepart of the general system of the United Nations Charterand the regional system of OAU. It will cover all aspectsof security  including natural disasters. Politicalconsiderations cannot be forgotten  for experience hasshown that conflicts may well lead to the decay ofgovernmental institutions  the economy and social andpolitical institutions.37Under these circumstances  any intervention strategyis designed first and foremost to deal with disarmament demobilization and the reintegration of combatants ordisplaced persons  as well as the rehabilitation ofinfrastructures and above all the reconstruction of society with democracy as the key word.All in all  member States believed that it was preciselybecause it was conceived for development and economicintegration that ECOWAS was particularly suited toundertake peace-building in the region. The implementationof the mechanism will depend above all upon the politicalwill of member States. For its part  CÃ´te dâIvoire will beinvolved  as it was in the quest for peace in Liberia andSierra Leone  and as it is now in the case of mediation tobring peace back to Guinea-Bissau.I should like to take this opportunity to thank andcongratulate the Governments of the United States ofAmerica  France and Great Britain for deciding toharmonize their various initiatives to assist our armies inorder to enhance our peacekeeping capabilities.In this connection  I am happy that we arecommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the firstpeacekeeping operation in 1948  and I pay tribute to thememory of all the men and women who have given theirlives in the service of the United Nations.Assuring collective security in the context of credibleinternational cooperation and guaranteeing fair  sustainabledevelopment is an ongoing challenge to the United Nations;it must urgently provide appropriate  concrete answers.In this regard  I believe that our action must beconducted on three very distinct fronts.In the first place  we must firmly recall  whenevernecessary  the fundamental principles proclaimed by theSan Francisco Charter concerning relations between States and in particular the independence and territorial integrityof Member States of the United Nations. Since the end ofthe cold war  conflicts between States have almost entirelydisappeared  and that fully reflects the legal force of theprinciples I have just mentioned.Let me stress that in Africa the principle of theinviolability of borders is of capital importance  as theOAU has emphasized since its establishment. Theupheavals in the Great Lakes region must be settled inaccordance with this principle.Secondly  it is necessary to discourage and ban frominternational society those regimes which violate the mostelementary principles of democracy.Finally  it is vital to enhance international peace bya clear delineation of the responsibilities of the UnitedNations and regional organizations. In this connection  wewould like to note and hail the complementarity andharmony of efforts made  within the context of the UnitedNations  by the Non-Aligned Movement  the OAU andthe Southern African Development Community (SADC) in order to put an end to the new crisis besetting theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Their combinedforces have secured the return to stability of several WestAfrican countries.Here  I would like to salute in particular the actionof ECOWAS and its military component  ECOMOG  andinvite the international community to provide them withevery possible support necessary for the accomplishmentof their mission. This interaction between the worldOrganization and regional organizations must be furtherstrengthened in the future.In conclusion  I would like briefly to mention theveritable â€œsea serpentâ€ of the process of reforming theUnited Nations and the United Nations system and toexpress a certain disappointment at the very limitedresults we have achieved after several years of effort. Thequestion of restructuring the Security Council seems to beat a standstill  even though  in almost ritual fashion  atone session after another we renew the mandate of theWorking Group charged with reaching an agreementacceptable to all Member States.As for the excellent reform programme that theSecretary-General presented to us last year  it hascertainly been very positively received  but we havepostponed certain decisions that are ours alone to makewith regard to certain of his suggestions andrecommendations. I hope that the present session of theGeneral Assembly will enable us to enrich our thinkingon reform and finally move on to action in this sphere."
"34",1396,"CMR",53,1998,"Allow me first of all  Sir  toconvey  on behalf of my delegation  my warmest andmost heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Opertti on hiselection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session. His election is a tribute to his country Uruguay  a country with which Cameroon shares manycommon ideals. It is also a mark of our confidence in hisqualities as a diplomat and lawyer of renown. He can restassured of the full cooperation of the delegation ofCameroon in successfully discharging his important duty.I also pay a warm tribute to his predecessor Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  the former Minister for ForeignAffairs of Ukraine  who discharged with effectiveness andauthority the delicate and high-profile mission with whichhe was entrusted.Finally  I renew the firm support of my country Cameroon  for the work undertaken by the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  at the head ofthe Secretariat of our Organization since his election. Hehas resolutely and effectively tackled the reform of theUnited Nations with discretion  tact and realism  so as tomake it capable of meeting the challenges facing it.At a time of globalization and informationsuperhighways  it is more urgent and necessary than everto place the development and dignity of humankind at thecentre of our concerns. We must also acknowledge thatthe tremendous technological advances at the end of thiscentury justify high hopes of a better tomorrow.By working for the right to development for bothpresent and future generations  by charting new and moresecure paths in the quest for peace  by watching overinternational security more effectively than in the past our Organization is  at this delicate period in history helping to ease the anguish of humankind in aninternational environment that is increasingly complex unequal and disquieting.In this context  the current session of the GeneralAssembly gains greater prominence and importancebecause it coincides with two fiftieth anniversaries: thatof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that of9the start of peacekeeping operations. Those two events willform the basis of my remarks.With regard to the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  the first words of the preamble retain  50 yearslater  striking relevance. It states:“recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equaland inalienable rights of all members of the humanfamily is the foundation of freedom  justice and peacein the world”.Human rights are  first and foremost  a question ofdignity: dignity for every human being; dignity for all ofhumankind. We believe that this search for dignity  whichis a condition for peace  justice and freedom in the world is the common ideal towards which all human rights actionsand activities should be aimed.The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary is atrue rallying call to us and should provide the internationalcommunity with an opportunity to refocus its approach tohuman rights questions  which remains very simplistic.Indeed  too often we forget that civil and political rights which exercise the international community so much  canbe fully developed only if economic  social and culturalrights are also guaranteed. Recent experiences ofdemocratization processes in Africa remind us  by theirvery fragility  of the incontrovertible indivisibility universality and interdependence of human rights.To paraphrase the words the head of State ofCameroon  His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya  spoke at theWorld Food Summit in Rome  what dignity can there be forthe hungry? The international community must thereforegive equal priority to the promotion of the right to aminimum standard of living.In a world in which the globalization of trade  insteadof placing human beings at the centre of its concerns merely means speculation  market manipulation and dealsthat generate the greatest profits  making the rich richer andreducing the poorest to destitution  the social environmentitself is the cause of tension and conflict. That is why wecongratulate the Secretary-General on his report (A/52/871) submitted to the Security Council as document S/1998/318on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durablepeace and sustainable development in Africa.In this context  it is apt that  in seeking to establish atrue culture of human rights and fundamental freedoms  theinternational community has chosen the central theme of thecommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary to be “humanrights for all”.Poverty is today the most serious threat to humandignity. This is particularly true in Africa  which is theleast advanced region and the one most seriously affectedby the economic crisis. Despite the reforms that havetaken place  at enormous social cost  to promote goodgovernance  democracy and the liberalization ofeconomies  meeting basic needs remains for many aluxury in that continent. Whether we are talking aboutaccess to drinking water  primary health care  oreducation or about transport or other communicationinfrastructures  international cooperation has not yet bornefruit in a reliable  continuing  predictable and effectiveway.Official development assistance  which elsewhere hashelped to give rise to decent standards of living  isdwindling drastically. Despite the increasingly favourablejuridical environment offered by Africa  investors seem tobe losing interest in the region. The debt burden is gettingworse. Our products do not have easy access tointernational markets  nor are they priced according totheir true value.It is clear that the marginalization of Africa seemsinevitable unless a true spirit of solidarity quicklyprovides real long-term solutions. It is time for thevarious initiatives  plans of action and other programmesadopted to benefit Africa to be translated into reality.Basing itself on the efforts made by the peoples of Africa the international community must increase its assistanceto that continent so as to enable Africans themselves tomake the progress that is indispensable for developingtheir potential. In that way African countries will be ablesuccessfully to integrate themselves into world economicnetworks and achieve the development to which theylegitimately aspire  despite the well-known geographicaland historical handicaps. Such a development wouldinevitably benefit all of humankind.This solidarity should take the specific form ofreconsideration — indeed  the cancelling — of the debtsof African countries. We should recall that decisions tocancel debt in the past have enabled countries in difficultand precarious situations to rediscover the road toeconomic prosperity  democracy and greater politicalstability.The path thus seems clearly laid out for the richcountries that are working to promote freedom and human10rights. They should reflect  at the dawn of the thirdmillennium  on their relations with developing countriesthat are becoming poorer because of their deepindebtedness.North-South solidarity should also be reflected in anew concept of official development assistance. Suchassistance is indispensable for establishing developmentinfrastructure within the context of poverty eradication.Private flows  channelled through non-governmentalorganizations  cannot alone take on that role. Furthermore structural adjustment should aim to strengthen and improvethe autonomous management capacity of countries indifficulty. Otherwise  globalization will mean that certaincountries become richer while others become poorer. Thatwould render meaningless the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights and put in grave danger the requirement ofdignity for every human being  for all people and for peacein the world.Indeed  what freedom or self-determination — andespecially  what sovereignty — can there be for a starvingpeople? What democracy can there be for a peoplesuffering from malnutrition  with no access to basic healthcare  drinking water or elementary education. We thus needto return the human being to the centre of development.Cameroon has constantly contributed to this loftyendeavour.The salient activities we have undertaken to mark thefiftieth anniversary in my country include informing peopleabout human rights and making all of society aware ofhuman rights issues through media campaigns  seminars conferences and poster campaigns throughout our land even in villages; the introduction of human rights teachingin schools and universities; issuing special postage stamps;promoting in particular the rights of women  children anddisabled or infirm people  establishing a prize for the bestresearch in the human rights area; and the opening by thehead of State of a public square dedicated to human rights.But above and beyond commemorating theanniversary  Cameroon has for a decade been makingimportant progress in promoting human rights. It did sofirst through a series of legislative and regulatory measuresthat  inter alia  abolished legal exemptions  restoredindividual and collective freedoms  put an end to censorshipand ensured better protection for the interests of workersand vulnerable social sectors.Through constitutional revision and a progressiveelectoral system  we have established total adherence to theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and ensured thefull participation of our people in making politicalchoices. Furthermore  a national committee for humanrights and freedoms was established in 1990  which isfreely carrying out its activities throughout the country  asare the many non-governmental organizations and humanrights groups that have come into being.With regard to progress made in the world since theadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsand the efforts that remain to be made in this area  thereis no doubt that the promotion of and respect for humanrights are a difficult  ongoing endeavour. Vigilance musttherefore be our watchword  and the struggle for humanrights should not flag in any region of the world.The United Nations must continue to ensure thathuman rights are fully enjoyed by all the peoples of theworld. To that end  the letter and spirit of the UniversalDeclaration should gradually be adapted to changingmores and to science and technology. Bodies that areabove the fray of ideologies and interests should ensurethat it is observed  including through a system of regionaland international human rights courts.With regard to the fiftieth anniversary ofpeacekeeping operations  we wish to pay tribute to thework done by the United Nations  which has always madeits presence felt wherever peace has been threatened.Thanks to the Blue Helmets  the United Nations is presentin all the world’s trouble spots  keeping the peace.It is true that some voices have been heard here andthere deploring their sluggishness  hesitation and  in somecases the inaction. Sometimes the presence of a UnitedNations force or mission has not been able to preventlarge-scale massacres or crimes against humanity perpetrated in violation of the most elementary rules ofhumanitarian law. Such limits to the actions of ourOrganization remind us in a very timely manner that theUnited Nations can act only within the limits of themeans made available to it by the Member States. It is upto Member States  therefore  to provide it with thenecessary resources to enable it to respond fully to themission entrusted to it by the peoples of the UnitedNations.Despite these limits  we must acknowledge in apositive spirit that over the years many peacekeepingoperations and other actions taken by the Secretary-General have made it possible to prevent the emergence aggravation or continuation of many conflicts.11Thanks to the Blue Helmets  millions of human liveshave been saved  and sometimes the United Nations haspaid a heavy price for this total commitment to the cause ofpeace. The recent tragic death of Mr. Alioune Blondin Beyeand his team  to whose memory I wish to reaffirm thefraternal homage of the people of Cameroon  is one moreparticularly unhappy example of this point.By ensuring the safety of peoples  the delivery ofhumanitarian aid and respect for ceasefire agreements andby performing an increasing number of administrative tasks the Blue Helmets are helping restore confidence andprevent loss of life and the disintegration of certain States.Such commitments and sacrifices deserve all ourencouragement.The fiftieth anniversary of peacekeeping operationsshould provide us with an opportunity to think aboutquestions relating to their continuation: problems offinancing  the safety of personnel involved in theoperations  the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations andethical issues.With regard to the ethical issues  Cameroon believesthat it is time to formulate a code of conduct so that peopleparticipating in peacekeeping operations can remain  aboveall  protectors of human rights as well as true beneficiariesof them. Given the many tasks expected of theseoperations  it would be appropriate to review their range their scope and the modalities governing them.Even now  as we congratulate the United Nations onits work for peace  conflicts are still destroying lives tearing apart families and communities and placing at riskthe future of young generations throughout the world. Thereports of the Security Council and of the Secretary-General  which we receive on a regular basis  areparticularly important in this respect.The resurgence of terrorism is another element of thepicture  as we were recently reminded by the deadly attacksagainst the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam and the attack in Omagh. Cameroon  a peaceful justice-loving country  strongly condemns these unfortunateevents that show that we need to redouble our efforts to putan end to mindless violence.This means that we must silence weapons  preventdisputes and above all create the conditions for true peace.That does not mean merely the absence of armedconflict  but living together in harmony  with the entireinternational community and all nations building togethera society that respects individual and collective freedoms.We need to begin by recognizing and acceptingdifferences as a source of richness and dynamism. Weneed to practise tolerance and dialogue  the latter not justbetween the citizens of one nation but also betweenStates  in order to build a more fraternal and democraticsociety.This means in particular that we must opt to settledisputes through peaceful means and that States must turnwhenever necessary to the International Court of Justiceas the judicial organ of the United Nations and theessential cog not only in the machinery for peacefulsettlement of disputes  but also within the general systemof peacekeeping and international security established bythe Charter.At the end of the United Nations Decade ofInternational Law  the call has become urgent for Statesto demonstrate themselves psychologically prepared toseek recourse naturally to the International Court ofJustice and the political bodies of the United Nations andthose of regional organizations. This is Cameroon’sconviction  as well as that of the General Assembly which in resolution 3232 (XXIX)  paragraph 6  reaffirmedthat “recourse to judicial settlement of legal disputes particularly referral to the International Court ofJustice  should not be considered an unfriendly actbetween States.”That is why Cameroon went to the InternationalCourt of Justice at The Hague with regard to its disputewith Nigeria over territorial and maritime boundaries. Inthis context  I should like to take this opportunity to makean urgent appeal to the international community  andespecially to the United Nations  to help keep the peacebetween our two countries before  during and after theCourt’s verdict.Silencing weapons is a good thing; eliminating theiruse through prevention and — why not? — throughdisarmament is even better. That is why we must not restuntil all weapons of mass destruction are eradicated  bethey of a nuclear  chemical  biological or other nature.It must be pointed out here that another danger hasappeared in certain subregions of Africa — namely  theproliferation of small arms and their illicit circulation.This phenomenon is already a threat to peace and should12be quickly contained because it can sow the seeds ofconflict.The conclusions of the recent seminar organized bythe United Nations Secretariat in Yaoundé from 27 to 31July 1998 within the framework of the Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa areparticularly illustrative in that regard. I would like to thankthe Secretary-General and donor countries for their supportof the activities of that Committee. We know that we cancontinue to count on their support in implementing therecommendations of that seminar  especially in continuingthe Committee’s activities. That institution is called on toplay a crucial role in mobilizing the countries of centralAfrica to take responsibility for the security of theirsubregion under the aegis of the United Nations.Also with regard to prevention  the recent creation inRome of the International Criminal Court is a timelyaddition to the mechanisms that protect human rights andmaintain peace. The International Criminal Court will ineffect be responsible for prosecuting and punishing personsguilty of genocide  war crimes  crimes against humanityand the crime of aggression. Cameroon is pleased to havebeen one of the first signatories to its Statute and hopes thatall States will become parties to it. To this end  it is urgentthat the crime of aggression be rapidly and clearly defined.This would abolish the impunity of aggressors and prove tothe peoples of the world our real determination to put anend to war once and for all.In the context of this general debate  I havedeliberately chosen  as the Assembly has seen  not to touchon most current problems  particularly ongoing crises. Iwanted to concentrate on certain permanent essential valuesthat lie at the basis of the two observances I mentioned whose violation causes most of the misfortune in our worldtoday. I refer to the human persons’s right to dignity andfulfilment  the right to development and the right topeace — in short  the right to life. The United Nations isthe guarantor of their observance and promotion.For Africa  the recent report of the Secretary-General which should act as a kind of compass for all of us  laysdown the foundations for all those committed to workingfor the prosperity of our peoples. In reality  all regions ofthe world need this kind of wake-up call and this kind ofreport. We are accountable to future generations for makingthese values a reality.Let us not disappoint. Let us not allow people to beleft along the side of the road. It is up to us to doeverything possible so that these humane values remain aconstant concern of the United Nations and of itsspecialized agencies."
"35",1439,"COD",53,1998,"I should like first ofall to carry out the noble duty of adding my voice tothose who have spoken before me from this rostrum incongratulating Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdregular session. I am convinced that with the effectivecooperation of the elected members of his Bureau  he willspare no effort to ensure the success of our work.I should also like to take this opportunity to paytribute to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for the skill withwhich he so honourably discharged his weightyresponsibilities as President of the General Assembly atits fifty-second session.The fifty-third session of the General Assembly istaking place at a time when my country  the Democratic24Republic of the Congo  is the victim of armed aggressionby its neighbours  Rwanda and Uganda  that has beentaking place since 2 August. The seriousness of the actionsof these two invading countries  which are States parties tothe noble ideals of the charters of the United Nations andof the Organization of African Unity (OUA)  obliges me todwell at length on this dispute in the hope of helping theAssembly understand better the drama that is currentlytaking place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  mydear homeland.In order to enable the Assembly better to understandthis war and all of its consequences  a brief reminder of thefacts is necessary.On 27 July 1998  the President of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Mzee Laurent-Désiré Kabila  afterconsultations with his Rwandan and Ugandan counterpartstook the sovereign decision to terminate Rwanda’s militaryand technical cooperation and to put an end to the presenceof foreign troops throughout the national territory.When Rwanda’s troops left Congolese territory  it wasnoticed that certain Tutsis of Rwandan origin  calledBanyamulenge  followed suit.A week later  Congolese towns bordering onRwanda — Goma  Bukavu and Uvira — were seized byarmed elements that came from that neighbouring country.On 6 August  aircraft started shuttling between Gomaand Kitona  in the west of the country  via Kigali  over adistance of more than 2000 kilometres. After one of thecivilian pilots was killed for refusing to carry out orders these aircraft were diverted from Goma airport to transporttroops and matériel the west  under the direction of Mr.James Kabarehe  the ex-Chief of Staff of the Congo.At the same time  columns of armoured vehicles andother military equipment crossed the border from Ugandaunder the pretext of defending Ugandan interests in theCongo.Despite the protests of the Congolese Government which demanded their immediate withdrawal  Ugandantroops surrounded the town of Bunia in the eastern part ofthe country on 13 August 1998.On the same day  the Inga hydroelectric dam wasoccupied by the Rwandan-Ugandan coalition forces. Theysabotaged the installations in order to deprive the capital Kinshasa  of electricity and drinking water.On 23 August 1998  Ugandan troops attackedKisangani  in the north-eastern part of the country  andlater occupied it.These facts  and these acts of violence — confirmedby independent sources — provide ample proof of theaggressive involvement of Kigali and Kampala in thehuge plot to Balkanize the Democratic Republic of theCongo  all in defiance of international law and theprinciple of the inviolability of borders inherited from thecolonial period  pursuant to the Charter of theOrganization of African Unity.Indeed  one of the two aggressor countries  Uganda made no bones about admitting publicly that its troopsoccupied certain positions in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo.As can be seen  what some media sources wronglydescribed as a rebellion from the east was simply ashameful plot to destabilize my country politically andeconomically  and the covetous intentions of Rwanda andUganda regarding my country’s many natural resourceswere barely concealed.The Democratic Republic of the Congo is once againpaying a high price for this war imposed on it from theoutside. Among the countless examples are the massacresof thousands of innocent Congolese  including membersof religious orders  women  children and elderly people inthe east and in the west. These sordid crimes remind usof the killing of Hutu refugees by elements of the sameRwandan Patriotic Army. Further examples include themassive deportations from Kivu towards Rwanda ofpeople whose fate remains unknown; the summaryexecutions of prisoners of war; the dismantling  sabotageand destruction of the industrial  shipping and economicinfrastructure of the country  damage which  to date  hasbeen estimated at about $3 billion for Matadi alone; themore than three-week cut in the provision of electricpower and water to the capital  Kinshasa  a city of morethan 6 million people  which was a real humanitariantragedy  as is illustrated by the fact that large stocks offresh foodstuffs were declared unfit for consumption;reports of countless deaths in the hospitals becausedoctors were unable to work in the conditions required bytheir noble profession; and the postponement  sine die  ofthe polio vaccination campaign mandated by the WorldHealth Organization  with untold consequences on thelives of our children  which gravely compromises thefuture of our country.25Despite the situation of aggression  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  which is a peace-loving nation thatrespects international conventions reaffirms its commitmentto the principles of the Charter and its unshakeable faith inthe promotion of a culture of peace in the Great Lakesregion.The first manifestation of this ideal was demonstratedby the Government when it appealed to the SecurityCouncil and the Secretary-General to obtain the immediateand unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces.Unfortunately  the reaction of the internationalcommunity did not match the gravity of the situation in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Even one of the mostimportant bodies in the United Nations system — theSecurity Council — after much procrastination  merelyissued a few ambiguous statements calling for a ceasefireand the withdrawal of foreign troops without  unfortunately specifying them by name. On the other hand  in similarcases — in Kosovo  in Bosnia and in Kuwait — theSecurity Council dealt with the situation promptly andpractically to restore peace. Why was there this silencefrom the international community  particularly fromSecurity Council? The Council’s policy of double standardson this issue could set an unfortunate precedent that couldseriously undermine the credibility of the United Nationsand wipe out the reform efforts under way.Given this situation that does no credit to ourcommunity  the Government of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  mindful of its heavy responsibilities toguarantee the territorial integrity of the country  wasobliged to resort to an armed response to put an end to theinvasion. Pursuant to Article 51 of the Charter  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo appealed to its allies todeal with Ugandan-Rwandan aggression.I would like to take this opportunity to thank membercountries of the Southern African Development Community(SADC)  in particular  Angola  Namibia and Zimbabwe which responded to our appeal. I would also like to paytribute to the valiant Congolese people  who undertook todefend their homeland when it was under attack. I am alsograteful to Belgium  which had the courage to publiclycondemn a country in the Great Lakes region that wasinvolved in this act of aggression  and to Ms. ColetteBraeckman  who had the courage to denounce the plotagainst my country  as well as Chad  Gabon and manyother African countries that publicly demonstrated theirsupport and denounced this aggression.The Assembly will agree with me that no honourablenation can allow its sovereignty and territorial integrity tobe called into question. The Congolese people will neveraccept subjugation  oppression or the imposition ofperverse values such as a cultural genocide  which is soblithely tolerated by certain States.The International Criminal Court whose Statute wassigned recently in Rome should get down to work andimmediately prosecute those who seek the destruction ofhuman beings but who cover up their actions by makinginnocent people take the blame.The failure of the various appeals for a ceasefirecannot be blamed on the Democratic Republic of theCongo. It is rather the result of the obstinacy  bad faithand cynicism of Rwanda and Uganda during thenegotiations held in Victoria Falls and in Addis Ababa.Since the first summit  held at Victoria Falls lastAugust  the Democratic Republic of the Congo hasindicated that implementation of the ceasefire wascontingent on the immediate  unconditional withdrawalfrom our national territory of foreign troops not invited bythe Government of the Democratic Republic of theCongo. I believe that the General Assembly and theSecurity Council are obligated properly to implement therelevant provisions of the Charter  in particular those ofChapter VII  which envision action by the worldOrganization with respect to threats to the peace  breachesof the peace  and acts of aggression.Despite the situation in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  our Government continues to abide by thetimetable leading to the democratization of our politicallife. In that connection  I wish to inform the Assemblythat on 22 September 1998 our head of State signed Law122  relating to the organization and exercise of power inmy country. The new law grants the ConstitutionalCommission prerogatives allocated to the ConstituentAssembly  finalizing the draft constitution to be thesubject of a referendum that will be organized early in1999.I reassure the international community that mycountry has noble aspirations and to date has granted nomaterial or military support whatsoever to the formerRwandese Armed Forces  to the Interahamwe extremists or much less to the Front pour la défense de ladémocratie  contrary to the campaign of slander andincitement waged by aggressors wishing to absolve26themselves of the massacre of more than a thousand peoplein and around Kasika.I cannot conclude without speaking of the rebuildingof the Democratic Republic of the Congo in particular andof the need for socio-economic development in Africa ingeneral; the continent continues to face crises of all kindsand is trying in vain to meet the challenge of recovery. Inthis context  the role of the United Nations should not belimited to accompanying Africa in implementing measuresthat have been or will be adopted. Through capacity-building  the United Nations system must translate intofact the organic partnership between itself and theOrganization of African Unity.In the case of my country  the war imposed upon itby its neighbours has destroyed what remained of itseconomic fabric  which had long suffered from theeconomic mismanagement of the former dictatorship. Thatis why I appeal urgently to the United Nations and morespecifically to the “Friends of the Congo” — which at theBrussels conference decided to provide the assistanceneeded to rebuild the Democratic Republic of the Congo— to contribute to the trust fund established for thatpurpose  with a view to helping in the economic recoveryand the rebuilding of my country.I wish in conclusion to say that my country wouldappreciate enormously any action that the United Nationsmight consider to prevail upon the Rwandese Republic tosign the non-aggression pact among the members of theStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions inCentral Africa  and to establish democracy in Rwanda andUganda. For all my country’s problems are repercussionsof the policy of non-democratization in Rwanda and inUganda. The international community would thus beperforming a useful task."
"36",1486,"COG",53,1998,"It is a pleasure for me to convey to you  Sir  thesatisfaction of the delegation of Congo at seeing youconducting our work. Your unanimous election to thepresidency of the fifty-third session of the GeneralAssembly not only denotes recognition by theinternational community of your great qualities as astatesman and experienced diplomat  but also attests to theimportant role played by your country  Uruguay  in themaintenance of peace in the world.12Mr. President  I wish to convey to you and to theother members of the Bureau our heartfelt  sincerecongratulations and to assure you of the full cooperation ofthe delegation of Congo. I should like also to pay well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  for the competence and open-mindedness withwhich he conducted the work of the previous session.Finally  I wish to express the appreciation of ourdelegation to the Secretary-General of our Organization Mr. Kofi Annan  who  in a world where violence  injusticeand frustration predominate  has been tirelessly striving toassert the virtues of dialogue and tolerance and to promotepeace and development. Peace and development: these twoideals have for decades posed a major challenge to theinternational community.It is very difficult to take the floor after all of theoutstanding and talented speakers who have spoken fromthis rostrum. What more could I add to all of the points soeloquently made about Africa and the rest of the world?For more than a decade now  Africa has made theheadlines only as the result of crises and conflicts: civilwars  inter-State wars  drought  famine and epidemics. Allof these obstacles so impede the development of ourcontinent that we cannot but wonder whether Africa will beentering the third millennium on the wrong foot.Unfortunately  Congo  my country  is an example ofthis. A year ago  Congo had been in the throes of a civilwar for five long months. The international community andour Organization in particular strove hard to find anegotiated solution to the conflict. We wish to pay tributeto the commendable efforts made by the Secretary-Generaljointly with a numerous African heads of State.Unfortunately  we all know that these efforts wereunsuccessful.We are convinced that respect for the state of law andgood governance remain  in a sound economic environment a prerequisite for the well-being of our peoples. And it isbecause they did not understand this point that the formerruling class imposed on the peaceful citizens of my countrytwo civil wars in the space of five years  the latest ofwhich — that of 1997 — was the most deadly and the mostdevastating.We do not intend to dwell on the many ways theformer regime violated the rules of democracy  even if thiswould be helpful in understanding the causes of the tragicevents that my country has experienced.Today the war is over. Congo is resolutely lookingto the future. The future means national reconciliation; itmeans rebuilding our devastated country; it meansresuming the democratic process.From 5 to 14 January last  a national forum was heldat Brazzaville to study practical modalities to attain thesegoals. That forum  which brought together more than1 400 participants representing all segments of Congolesesociety  established a transitional Parliament and set theduration for this transitional period at three years.The Government of National Unity and PublicSalvation is now concentrating on the following priorities:the reconciliation of all the sons and daughters of thecountry; the rehabilitation of our infrastructure; therestoration of State administration; the resumption of thedemocratic process — census-taking started again lastAugust; the reorganization of our national economy with inter alia  the privatization of the major State companies;and the resumption of negotiations with internationalfinancial institutions  which concluded in June this yearwith the adoption of a post-conflict programme.Today  in the light of the results obtained  we canstate that the transitional timetable will be respected.These encouraging results have yet to beconsolidated  and our country is still fragile because ofthe turmoil in the subregion.The events taking place in the Democratic Republicof the Congo cause great concern to my country  sinceour stability largely depends on that of our neighbours. Itherefore want to reaffirm the Congolese Government?scommitment to respect the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ourcountry will never serve as a base of operations for thedestabilization of this fraternal country.Understanding the costs of civil war and anxious tocontribute to finding a political solution to this crisis Congo (Brazzaville) has been working with its variouscontacts among all the States of the subregion. This wasthe case in Durban during the summit of the Non-AlignedCountries  when President Denis Sassou Nguesso metmost of his counterparts  and more recently in Libreville at the summit of Central African heads of State.Our country intends to honour its commitmentsunder the relevant provisions of Conventions of theOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations13relating to refugees and displaced persons. Therefore  Imust solemnly repudiate the false allegations by certainmedia of a supposed agreement between the Governmentsof the two Congos to transfer displaced Rwandans locatedin Congo (Brazzaville) to Congo (Kinshasa) so that theycan participate in the war. The displaced Rwandans livingin Congo (Brazzaville) are in fact under the control of theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees  and any movement of them is taking placewithout the support of our Government  which wishes toinform the international community that it refuses to acceptany responsibility for the consequences.In Angola the hopes aroused by the Lusaka Protocolhave been continually dashed by the bad faith and suddenreversals of position of Mr. Jonas Savimbi  who is therebytaking a whole segment of the Angolan people hostage denying them the opportunity to pursue development tasks.My country firmly supports the Angolan Government in itsefforts to achieve lasting peace in the country and tofinalize rapidly and completely the implementation of theLusaka Accords. My country completely supports thedecision adopted by the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity heads of State or Government in Mauritius describing Mr. Jonas Savimbi as the person solelyresponsible for the deterioration of the situation in Angolaand calling upon other States to refrain from providing anysupport for Mr. Jonas Savimbi and his militarist wing.I would like to take this occasion to pay tribute to thememory of Alioune Blondin Beye  a worthy son of Africa who gave the best of himself  including making thesupreme sacrifice  in the search for peace in Angola.As regards other hot spots  the Congo alwaysadvocates negotiated solutions. Therefore  we welcome theceasefire in Guinea-Bissau  and we hope that it will be usedto work out a final solution to that conflict.The same goes for the conflict between Ethiopia andEritrea; in this regard  we support the efforts of theOrganization of African Unity mediation committee.We cannot overlook the crises and tensions prevailingin other parts of the world  notably in the Middle East where the peace process relaunched by the Oslo Accords isnow stalled  but also in South Asia  where the recentnuclear tests conducted by India and then Pakistan haveheightened the already high level of tension.The establishment of just and lasting peace in theworld requires full recognition of the destabilizing factorsas well as of the real solutions to development problems.One only needs recall the extent to which peace anddevelopment are linked.In the light of the changes in the world  and aftermore than half a century of existence  the United Nationsseems to be gradually and dangerously moving away fromthe vision of its founding fathers. Solidarity seems to begiving way to a selfishness that has no time forsolidarity. This new trend is making increasinglydifficult the management of economic questions  whichhave already been the subject of much thought  withoutproducing any prospect of an improvement in the livingstandards of the peoples of most of our States.Violence  famine  disease and poverty continue toafflict our peoples. The underlying causes of thesescourges are constantly the subject of a multitude ofstudies and various economic stimulation anddevelopment programmes  but without result  because ofa lack of real commitment by the internationalcommunity. The Agenda for Development  theinternational strategy for the development of Africa  theSecretary-General?s System-wide Special Initiative onAfrica — to cite merely those examples — are just somany plans that no longer give reason for optimism.Today globalization is supposed to be the panacea.This at least is the philosophy of worldwide liberalization.But how can we be confident when the exportopportunities for the developing countries are oftenneutralized by protectionism in a new guise  which usesvarious pretexts — technical standards  environmental andsocial concerns  or even concerns about human rights?How can we be confident when official developmentassistance continues to decline? How can we be surewhen the weakest economies are bending beneath theburden of debt?With regard to Africa  we believe that througheconomic integration we can mitigate the undesirableeffects of globalization. Through greater solidarity we canhope to meet the challenges we face.This year the international community iscommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. It is very significant thatthis anniversary coincides with the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court  which our Governmentconsiders to be a major step forward. We believe that thisevent puts the finishing touch to the magnificent edifice14that the founding fathers began constructing more than 50years ago.But today?s United Nations is not the same as the oldone. Where once there were only a few dozen MemberStates  today there are 185. The problems of peace anddevelopment are not what they were in 1945. It is time toreview the management of our communal house. It is timeto reform the Organization  including the Security Council.It is time to democratize the Organization in order to betteradapt it to the requirements of the coming millennium.I cannot conclude without expressing the compassionof the Congolese Government and those affected by thecalamity now afflicting the Caribbean and the southernUnited States as a result of hurricane Georges. This wantonunleashing of the forces of nature reminds us that we areall  large and small  in the same boat — our planetEarth — and that we must show solidarity to one another."
"37",1533,"COL",53,1998,"Mr. President  as I address the Assembly for thefirst time as President of Colombia  I should like to offeryou  on behalf of my Government  our warmestcongratulations on being elected to guide our debatesduring this session.A few weeks ago  the most important democraticelections in Colombia’s recent history took place. Despitethe problems that have besieged our nation in the last fewyears  our institutional structure has faced one of thesternest tests ever and has again shown that it is solid. InJune  more than 12 million people — one of the highestelectoral turnouts in the history of the Republic —expressed their free  spontaneous and conscious choice.Today  Colombia is looking towards new horizons.We have restored confidence in our country. We havestarted the changes which will enable us to face ourinternal problems with determination and which will winus a more positive and dynamic place in the internationalcommunity.Our most urgent task will be to build for peace. Thatis the unshakable commitment of my Government and theheartfelt desire of all of the Colombian people. We areaware that any process designed to root out the causes ofconflict for all time will be highly complex. But all ourefforts will be dedicated to this noble goal  and we willstrive for it tirelessly.It is for this reason that I have personally taken thelead in building peace. We are working hard on thepreparation of an agenda for this purpose. We areconvinced that representatives of all sectors of societyshould play a part  and that at the end of the road we willfind a guiding light that will lead our country again topeaceful coexistence. Peace in Colombia will also befounded on a clear strategy for economic development anda bold policy for social justice. Only in this way will it bepossible to forge a fruitful and lasting peace.As we travel the road to peace the support of theinternational community will complement our own efforts.We will advocate respect for fundamental rights andfull application of international humanitarian law among allthose involved in conflict. We will learn from the valuableexperiences of other countries in the solution of internalconflicts  and we will adopt whatever is applicable andappropriate to our own situation.Peace in Colombia will demand very substantialinvestments in social sectors and infrastructure in the zonesof conflict. For this  we will create a “Peace Fund”. Asignificant portion of the money required will come frominternal sources. We will also be looking for contributionsfrom the international community  from which we havealready received expressions of encouragement  solidarityand interest.All these actions will be part of what we have termed“diplomacy for peace”. It will be diplomacy with social andeconomic content. It will be diplomacy expressed ininvestment and in the mobilization of human  technical andfinancial resources  so that our peace will have a firm andlasting foundation.The achievement of peace in Colombia will be animportant initial contribution to the liberation of mankindfrom one of the twentieth century’s greatest evils: theglobal problem of illicit drugs. To the extent that we canfind agricultural alternatives for our peasant farmers  withfair prices for their products at home and abroad  they willbecome less dependent on illicit crops. The support of theinternational community will be crucial in this. Theeradication of illicit crops will be one of the centralelements of the peace talks that we intend to undertakewith the groups engaged in armed conflict.It is true that the end of East-West confrontationbrought into being a system of international relationsbased on détente and on a decline in the role that militarypower had played during the cold war. The spectre of anuclear cataclysm seemed to have vanished  and allhumanity embraced new hopes for the future.It was thought that the end of the cold war would bethe salvation of the many countries and the millions ofpeople who had been forgotten in the midst of tensionsand feuds between the two superpowers. But now  almost10 years later  those initial expectations are far frombecoming a reality. Ethnic and religious rivalries  regionalconfrontations and grave new threats to peace haveemerged.I must say most clearly that my Government and thepeople of Colombia absolutely reject all kinds and modesof terrorism  whatever their origin or motive. There canbe no truce with terrorism. All States must fight togetherto defeat it. This is surely one of our greatest challenges.Corruption is buffeting democracy in a growingnumber of countries and is becoming a cause of politicaland social breakdown. Illicit drugs continue to be one ofthe worst scourges of today’s society  bringing irreparableharm to the new generations and  therefore  to the futureof humanity.Human rights are still not properly respected.Women are still the target of abuse and discrimination.Children are the victims of disgraceful practices. Fiftyyears after the adoption of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights  the more vulnerable groups often have noaccess to the protection that States are obliged to providefor them.Unsustainable consumer and production practicesstill continue. The planet’s natural resources are beingdepleted  its biological wealth is being looted  and ourrivers and oceans are being contaminated. Povertycontinues to affect huge segments of society. Economicgrowth in some countries and the prosperity of somelevels of society contrast dramatically with themarginalization suffered by the majority of the world’spopulation.This situation is occurring in an internationalenvironment in which the right to development is2indissolubly linked to the existence of a favourableinternational climate. We are going through the mostserious financial crisis since the end of the cold war  butthere does not yet seem to be sufficient clarity and politicalwill to face it and overcome it.All Latin America has voiced its concern at the gravityof the crisis. Its origins are outside our region  in whichcountries have made structural reforms to achieve healthyeconomies that will enable them to meet the socialexpectations of their peoples.We are aware of the risk of a world recession  and weconsider it essential that the more developed countries  theGroup of Seven and the international financial organs adoptsuitable measures to prevent any new collapse. Such adisaster would irreversibly affect the developing countriesfirst. The measures should enable the financial markets torecover their stability and provide a rapid solution to thecurrent crisis in the world economy that has caused somuch concern.Among the proposals which Colombia made at the SanFrancisco Conference and which were included in theUnited Nations Charter  there are two I would now like tomention  because they belong to the common heritage ofour foreign policy: first  compliance in good faith with theobligations assumed by the Member States of the UnitedNations  as an underlying assumption for the validity of itsuniversal action; and secondly  recognition of the roleplayed by regional arrangements and agencies in themaintenance of peace  in international security as anintegrated concept and in the peaceful settlement of disputesbetween States.Colombia believes that universalism and regionalismare complementary and should support each otherharmoniously. Therefore  one of the aims of our diplomacyis to strengthen the regional agencies within the concept ofuniversalism. It is thus essential that we join our efforts toregain the momentum achieved on the occasion of thefiftieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations  sothat the Organization will be revitalized and ready for thebeginning of a new millennium.The various levels of action required are all based onthe credibility of the multilateralism which the UnitedNations embodies and the trust which our peoples have init. Some support the approval of certain reforms that theexperience of this period of history and the changes on theworld scene have in themselves made imperative. TheUnited Nations cannot be expected to possess magicformulas that we ourselves do not have for solvingproblems and situations that concern us all  within thecontext of the interdependence and internationalizationcharacteristic of our times. But we certainly need to adaptthem to this moment in history  when we face such widehorizons and colossal challenges. We need something ofthe idealism and pragmatic spirit which could be inspiredby solidarity among the human race.The reasons for the creation of the United Nationsnot only remain intact  but also have rapidly even becomemore relevant in the second half of the twentieth century.The principles which inspired its creation have become soimportant that any action taken unilaterally or by a groupof States turns out to be inadequate or limited in effect.Therefore  it will be useful to identify what we can do tomake the proposed reforms truly worthwhile. One mustseek a genuine consensus for the agenda of priorities forthe new millennium.Colombia is ready to help reconcile existingdisputes. This is not a question of a simple  formalagreement or of a quest for utopian reform  but of ameeting of wills and a methodical and open-mindedconsensus regarding proposals which are designed tobring us closer to an era of greater justice and balance.We must eliminate the contradiction in which moreresponsibilities  actions and programmes are demandedfrom the United Nations while at the same time someStates fail to meet their obligations or do not show anywillingness to increase their contribution in proportion totheir capacity. Without doubt  the United Nations must beproperly funded. The adaptation of structures  regulationsand modes of operation means that the Organization musthave the personnel and the funds it needs  throughefficient and exemplary management.Cooperation for development must receive a massiveinjection to save it from decline  and this must be inaccordance with the text and spirit of the Charter and ofcountless commitments  within an overall concept thatincludes encouragement of respect for human  individual social  economic and cultural rights.My Government has a policy of encouraging broaderparticipation by the new actors on the international stage such as non-governmental organizations and the privatesector. New sources of funding for certain social development and humanitarian programmes should besought  which should extend the scope of action of the3United Nations and ensure that it continues to steer thecommon course of international solidarity.We need multilateralism with social content  in whichthe human being is the central priority and in whichdevelopment is the guiding principle in decisions. I standbefore you to appeal to all nations to contribute to theburial of the post-cold-war period  to see it as no more thanan interregnum  and to open the door wide to an era ofcreative and more humane multilateralism.The original principles of the Organization are ofcourse still valid  but we need to make some adjustments.We need to reconsider certain modes of international actionand heed the voices of the peoples who desire developmentand fight for it in the midst of difficulty and conflict. Weneed to strengthen communication and dialogue betweenNorth and South and to correct unreasonable imbalances.We believe that the time has come to make anobjective review of the present state of negotiations for thereform of the Organization  in order to ensure that socialand economic matters are properly related to the legitimateaspirations of developing nations. There must beinstruments to encourage rapport between the organsoriginating from the San Francisco Charter and thoseinstitutions born at Bretton Woods.We know that the responses of individual nations orgroups of States are insufficient. Therefore  there is an evenmore urgent need to coordinate global responses throughvigorous multilateralism. There is an obvious dichotomybetween de facto globalization  science and technology instantaneous communications and the world market  on theone hand  and  on the hand  the absence of genuine socialorder and human advancement.We must revive an authentic and productive North-South dialogue  based on a concept of solidarity which ismore substantial than declarations or good intentions andwhich is expressed in specific action. It must take accountof the needs of the more vulnerable groups and of thoseexcluded from progress. It must replace the logic ofconfrontation and of the division between poor and richcountries with the logic of cooperation  sharedresponsibility and solidarity inspired by justice as thegolden rule of multilateralism.His Holiness Pope John Paul II summed up thisposition perfectly on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations  when  addressing this sameAssembly  he urged us to unite our efforts to build acivilization of love  founded on the universal values ofpeace  solidarity  justice and liberty  to overcome the fearwhich darkens human existence at the end of thetwentieth century.We firmly believe that the Charter and all theinstitutions of the international system must promotedynamic cooperation  each enriching the shared universalheritage with its own particular character.The United Nations must not be merely a forum forthe sovereign expression of States. It must be the placefor negotiation and synthesis in the political  cultural social and economic life of the nations.It is reassuring to see that the grand designs thatinspired the Charter remain valid. It is now our task tomaintain them and to interpret the new situations thatarise in the course of history.We know  for example  that conflicts within Statesare conceptually different from the old wars betweenStates. We have a greater understanding of the linkbetween peace and development and of the way in whichpolitics and socioeconomic interests are related. Webelieve that it is appropriate to consolidate a minimuminternational order and to replace violence and terrorismwith peace and coexistence  which should then thrivenaturally through multilateralism.Colombia encourages the efforts undertaken in armscontrol  with the systematic quest for disarmament as theultimate goal  and supports the priority allocation of worldand regional resources to development. We believe that itis therefore essential to make progress in the control andgradual elimination of weapons of mass destruction andto exercise effective control over the illegal arms trade  towhich thousands of men  women and children fall victimdaily throughout the world  and especially in thedeveloping countries.We need a realistic and methodical strategy to securepeace in our time and in the coming century. We need topromote monitoring mechanisms for treaty compliance the negotiated solution of conflicts and the creation ofnuclear-free zones with effective verification systems. Inthis respect  the United Nations will need to perfect early-warning systems to evaluate events so that its actions willbe efficient and genuinely preventive.I have come here today to reaffirm Colombia’sunbroken tradition as a nation devoted to the great4principles that underpin the very existence of the UnitedNations. We are prepared to offer  with thoughtfuloptimism  our support for the achievement of its purposesand its reforms. We believe it would be useful to reviewand appraise the results of the various summits held inrecent years  so that we may follow up their results andplans of action. This will serve both as a gauge of theireffectiveness and as the central element of the analysis ofthe coordination of the various institutions of the UnitedNations system as a whole.Our people rightly demand more effective action andless empty rhetoric. We cannot betray billions of humanbeings who yearn for a world at peace  with democracy andfreedom  and above all just  united and equitable."
"38",1573,"COM",53,1998,"Allow me at the outset  Mr. President  on behalf of thepeople and Government of my country  the Islamic FederalRepublic of the Comoros  to extend my sincere condolencesto all the States and peoples who have suffered devastationfrom Hurricane Georges  and to the victims of the floods inthe People’s Republic of China and in Bangladesh.I am pleased to be able to join with the distinguishedand worthy representatives of States and Governments whohave preceded me at this rostrum in extending to you  Sir on behalf of the President of the Islamic Federal Republicof the Comoros  His Excellency El Hadj Mohamed TakiAbdoulkarim  my warm congratulations on your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdregular session.I also pay tribute to your predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Hennadiy Udovenko  as well as to the greatly respectedMr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of our Organization for the dedication  skill and other outstanding qualitieswhich they have shown in carrying out their respective functions.My country  which is located at the north-westentrance to the Mozambique Channel  half way between theEast African coast and the large island of Madagascar small  fragmented and geographically isolated though it is was accepted to full membership in the United Nations on12 November 1975 by resolution 3385 (XXX)  as a Statecomprising the islands of Anjouan  Grande-Comore —also known as Ngazidja — Mayotte and Mohéli.We should also note that from 1889 until thereferendum through which my country acceded toindependence  all the laws and other regulatory textsapplied by the former colonial Power recognized andsanctioned the territorial unity and integrity of thearchipelago of the Comoros.Thus for 23 years  at each of the regular sessions ofthis Assembly  successive resolutions have been adoptedrecalling that the continuation of the legal  administrativeand military hold of the former colonial Power over theComorian island of Mayotte is a flagrant violation ofresolution 1514 (XV) and of the fundamental principlesof the United Nations Charter. We therefore hope that theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Ad Hoc Committeeof Seven on the Question of the Comorian Island ofMayotte  presided over by His Excellency Mr. OmarBongo  President of the Republic of Gabon  will resumeits work and re-establish the dialogue between theComoros and France on this question.Finally  we appeal to the wisdom and goodwillbeyond our continent  so that the Comoros can returnonce and for all to the path of peace  security and hope.I should like solemnly to appeal to this Assembly forassistance to my country so that a solution to the problemcaused by its dismemberment can be found and mycountry can enter the twenty-first century as a reunitedcountry.The people  Government and head of State whom Iam honoured and privileged to represent here today wouldlike to express  through my delegation  their gratitude andacknowledgement to the Secretary-General of ouruniversal Organization for the clarity and lucidity of hisanalysis of the causes of conflict on the African continentand for his courageous initiatives in the search for peaceand sustainable development in Africa and throughout theworld. In this context  we urge the United Nations systemand its specialized agencies to do all in their power toensure the rapid and complete implementation of all ofthe recommendations provided by the Secretary-Generalin his report to the Security Council which he presentedlast April.4My Government urgently appeals to the internationalcommunity for cooperation to effectively combat terrorismin all its forms. Only international determination  withrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  willmake it possible to put an end to horrendous terrorist acts.Terrorism spares no part of the world and no stratum ofsociety. Who can forget the murderous acts committed thissummer in Omagh  Ireland; Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam;Cape Town  South Africa; and Luxor  Egypt? For our part my Government is cooperating openly and fully with theAmerican authorities to shed light on the suspectedparticipation of a national of my country in the abhorrentcrimes committed in East Africa.Since my country is a telling example of the hotbedsof tension which are now mobilizing the resources of theinternational community  I should like to recall that for ayear and a half now the Organization of African Unity hastaken up — in close cooperation with the League of ArabStates  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and very recently  the Non-Aligned Movement — the separatistcrisis on the Comorian island of Anjouan and the links tobe established with the dismemberment of our archipelagoState by the island of Mayotte’s continuing to be underforeign administration.The efforts and commitments of the Secretary-Generalof the OAU  Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim  and his SpecialEnvoys  Ambassador Pierre Yéré and Mr. Mamoudou Kane since the beginning of the crisis  as well as the efforts ofthe Governments involved in regional coordination toresolve the crisis in the Comoros  namely  Kenya  Tanzania Mozambique  South Africa  Madagascar  Mauritius and theSeychelles  have been recognized and deserve admirationand support.My country’s people  Government and head of Statewould like to convey through my delegation to the entireinternational community their commitment to peace andunity and reconciliation between the community of islandswhich make up the nation of the Comoros.Special mention should be made here of the mostrespected statesman of our world  President NelsonMandela  who  in his dual capacity as head of Stateentrusted with regional coordination to resolve the crisis inthe Comoros  mandated by the OAU  and Chairman of theNon-Aligned Movement  has agreed to bring to bear his fullauthority and his personal prestige throughout the world tocall upon the parties in conflict in the Comoros to concludea peace of the brave  in which there is neither victor norvanquished  peace brought about for the greatest possiblebenefit of the inhabitants of our archipelago State.In the light of the claims and the rightsacknowledged by our institutions  traditions  conventionsand customs in a multi-island society  El Hadj MohamedTaki Abdoulkarim  President of the Islamic FederalRepublic of the Comoros  declared after the OAU summitin Ouagadougo  and again recently in Durban during theNAM summit  that he was ready to work in a spirit ofopenness and reconciliation for greater decentralizationand autonomy for each of the four islands making up ourarchipelago State. Thus each of our islands will be ableto elect a governor and a local legislative assembly todeal with all matters relating to the immediate andparticular concerns of each of our communities of theislands of the archipelago State. An inter-islandcommission will work for the equitable and proportionaldistribution of the international community’s resourcesand investments.Here I quote what El Hadj Mohamed TakiAbdoulkarim has rightly said  as follows:“This is an issue of bringing the administrationcloser to its subjects  promoting the responsibilitywithin a single citizenry and restoring the federalbodies of a united State their fundamental roles oforganization  arbitration and the management ofinternational sovereignty.“The future of our country will only be ensuredwhen all opinions and all trends  in an atmosphereof greater tolerance  are accepted and fulfilled.”(spoke in Arabic)“Thus have We made of youAn Unmat justly balanced.That ye might be witnessesOver the nations And the Messenger a witnessOver yourselves”. (The Holy Koran  II:143)"
"39",1612,"CPV",53,1998,"I take particular pleasure inextending to Mr. Didier Opertti and to his country Uruguay  my congratulations on his election to preside overthe work of this session of the General Assembly. Hiseminent qualities  as well as his diplomatic experience will undoubtedly ensure the success of our work.I also express my deep appreciation for the wiseleadership his predecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko imprinted on the work of the fifty-second session  thuscontributing to the positive results achieved.My country appreciates highly the creativity and theintellectual energy brought to United Nations affairs bySecretary-General Kofi Annan since he took over  and weparticularly appreciate his efforts to streamline UnitedNations structures.My Government fully supported the United Nationsprogramme of reforms aimed at conferring morecoherence and efficiency on the activities of the UnitedNations. We have no doubt that the streamlining of theUnited Nations administration will have a positive impacton the way the Organization handles the various andcomplex issues confronting the international community.The efforts made over recent years by theinternational community  the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  the African subregional organizations andby States individually to deal with the conflicts in theAfrican continent have produced some positive results some of them remarkable. This has contributed to therestoration of peace and the return to normalcy in severalof the affected countries. However  the resurgence of newconflicts and the reappearance of other conflicts which webelieved had already been resolved raise serious concerns particularly because of the threat they pose to peace andstability even beyond national borders. This situationraises the spectre of disastrous consequences for thepopulations? well-being and security and casts a shadowover the much-needed economic and social developmentof the affected countries.A strong commitment is required on the part of theinternational community to find ways and means to dealeffectively with the armed conflicts in the Africancontinent. In Africa  as in any other region of the world internal conflicts arise whenever individuals or groups ofpeople have no channels through which they can funneltheir legitimate claims through peacefully anddemocratically. In the end  the non-existence of dialogue the practice of intolerance and the absence of reliablejudicial means to deal with divergences are the shortestpath to armed conflict.14In his recent report to the Security Council on thismatter  the Secretary-General made a substantialcontribution to the understanding of the causes of conflictin our continent and their relationship to development  goodgovernance  democracy and human rights.Maintaining peace in fact becomes a difficult taskwhen we witness the deepening of social gaps; while theoverwhelming majority of the population has difficultyobtaining the essentials; when fundamental rights ofpopulations or parts of them  including the right toparticipate in the governance of their country  are notrecognized or respected; or when citizens or groups ofcitizens are discriminated against on the basis of ethnic cultural  religious or political considerations.This situation is compounded by the temptation ofoutside interference aimed at imposing policies or exertinginfluence on Governments — most of the time causing oraggravating conflict situations.The virus of violence and conflicts that plaguesAfrican regions and countries thrives in the precariousliving conditions of millions of Africans and the non-recognition in practice of the most fundamental rights ofcitizenship. Whenever one faces rampant famine  illiteracy ignorance  illness and oppression  whenever human dignityis not secured by the lofty ideals of full-fledged democracy or whenever the respect for human rights is not widelyupheld  then peace  stability and progress are in question.It is evident that if one wants to reduce the occurrenceof armed conflicts it is imperative to uphold respect for thefundamental rights of citizenship  tolerance and socialjustice and to support the creation of better livingconditions that comes with economic development.The United Nations  as the main guarantor of peace inthe world  has a major role to play in the mobilization ofthe resources and political will needed to confront Africancountries? colossal needs and overcome the prevalentsituation of underdevelopment and intolerance  which in theend favour the occurrence or persistence of armed conflicts.However  it must be recognized that it is up to AfricanStates  their leaders — especially those that hold the reinsof power — and their respective civil societies to assumecourageously their responsibilities  particularly in respect ofthe promotion of the sound and fair management of theirresources  the consolidation of democratic institutions  theobservation of and respect for the rights of citizenship andthe creation of a climate of tolerance and respect for thedignity and liberty of the human person.The sisterly country of Guinea-Bissau has gonethrough a difficult period in her history over the last twomonths  as it has been faced with an internal armedconflict. My country  which together with the otherPortuguese-speaking countries shares with Guinea-Bissaua long common history  has been following withparticular attention the situation unfolding in that sisterlycountry and has not spared any effort in contributing tothe search for a political and negotiated solution to thecrisis.In the framework of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) Contact Group  which wehave the honour to be coordinating  we will continue togive our best efforts to support a peaceful resolution ofthe crisis  and we hope that the joint mediation initiativeof the CPLP and the Economic Community of WestAfrican States will come to play an efficient and decisiverole in the ongoing peace process.We hope that the parties to the conflict will continueto strictly observe the ceasefire agreement signed at Praiaon 25 August and will also continue to show tolerance toenable Guinea-Bissau society to be reconciled soon.The difficult situation prevailing in Angola  acountry to which we are bound by profound brotherly tiesand a long common history  demands a strong anddecisive commitment on the part of the internationalcommunity in order to restore as soon as possiblecompliance with the obligations entered into in theframework of the Lusaka Protocol  while bearing in mindthe relevant Security Council resolutions. Of particularconcern to my country is the spectre of new armedconfrontations in Angola  raised by UNITA?s regrettabledefiance. The brotherly people of Angola  who for manyyears have been victimized by the prevailing situation ofwar  have the right to peace  political stability and amuch-needed national reconciliation.The current international financial crisis that recentlyshook the economies of many countries  especially inAsia  seems to raise increasing concerns for all of us. Itraises doubts about prospects for continuing the globalprosperity which  fuelled by economic growth  onceseemed so long-lasting. The former optimistic outlook haslately been called into question  especially in respect todeveloping nations  by a series of financial setbacks that15pose a threat to social stability  cohesion and peace in theaffected countries.The rapid degradation of economies considered to behealthy and in full expansion only months ago has been theobject of the special attention and concern of many thathave spoken from this rostrum in the last few days. Thefear and apprehensions that the stability of many Statesmay be affected negatively by the fallout resulting from thedynamics of globalization raise justifiable concern particularly about the speculative attacks against theeconomies of certain developing nations or the maintenanceof not so transparent management practices.At question is the equilibrium of the world economy the disturbance of which may have disastrousconsequences — economic and otherwise — for all of us.The ongoing democratization process taking place atdifferent rhythms in different countries could fall prey tothis situation. It could also lead to social and politicalinstability and give rise to risks to peace and security. It isillusory to believe that the negative impact of such aneconomic situation could be contained within theboundaries of developing nations  since the phenomenon ofglobalization seems to have created its own dynamics andknows no boundaries.The destinies of our countries  large and small alike industrialized or developing  are increasingly interlinked.Therefore  it is imperative that collectively we find effectivesolutions that facilitate the end of the crisis  promotegrowth on a global scale and secure a sustainable rhythm ofsocial and economic development.As a country severely affected by drought anddesertification  Cape Verde pays special attention to theenvironment.The environmental issues confronting mankind  as wellas of the relationship between man and nature  make itincumbent upon us to act in a swift  efficient and globalmanner so as to guarantee the preservation of the basicconditions that make life possible on Earth. Our primarytask should be to find a global strategy that will maintainthe balance of our ecosystems and at the same time securethe betterment of living conditions for the world?spopulation.However  this is easier said than done. Cape Verdeshares the view that  in order for us to confront the problemof environmental degradation  we should take a newapproach to the dynamics of economic and socialdevelopment  an approach that focuses on the eradicationof poverty. Until this is done  not much can be achievedin this regard  at least not in the developing countries.Against this background  my Government has beenenacting various pieces of legislation to bring the issue ofthe environment into its legal mainstream. However whatever legislative measures we and other developingcountries may enact  in order to reap the expectedenvironmental benefits  resources should be madeavailable by the international community to allowdeveloping nations to build their capacity to implementtheir own environmental programmes in a sustainedmanner.The end of the cold war seemed to have created anew dynamic for the issue of poverty through the Agendafor Development. Awareness of this issue seems to havebeen strengthened  since we cannot remain indifferent tothe extreme poverty that severely afflicts more than aquarter of the planet?s inhabitants. The spirit of solidaritythat guided the Copenhagen Summit must today bereflected in a gamut of concrete actions aimed atsupporting the huge efforts of developing countries intheir struggle against poverty  the creation of conditionsfor sustainable development and  consequently  thegeneral improvement of people?s living conditions.Cape Verde  within the framework of theengagement undertaken at that Summit  has been adoptingthe necessary measures to combat poverty in the country.Nevertheless  like other developing nations  especiallythose on the list of least developed countries  we find thatour internal efforts will not produce the expected resultswithout additional measures on the part of theinternational community. We believe that the specialfollow-up meeting to take place in the year 2000 shouldbe the occasion for a thorough assessment of the situationand for the launching of concrete action targeted at theeffective implementation of the engagements undertakenat the Copenhagen Conference.By the same token  I cannot but emphasize the issueof small island States  which  as is known  have specialchallenges and vulnerabilities  a global assessment ofwhich will be made next year  in keeping with theBarbados Programme of Action. It is expected that theinternational community will commit itself to concretemeasures with a view to implementing the engagementsundertaken under that Programme  which is of particularimportance for the sustained development of the smallisland States.16As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  the internationalcommunity should seize the occasion to make a detailedassessment of the global performance in protecting andrealizing all the rights of the human person. To this end  anassessment of the implementation of the Vienna Declarationand Programme of Action over the last five years wouldcontribute much.It should be borne in mind that the protection andpromotion of all human rights constitutes a major challengeto mankind as we approach the next millennium.Regrettably  throughout the world  political  ethnic orreligious intolerance  as well as armed conflicts  havebrought untold misery to millions of people whosefundamental rights have been violated  including thefundamental right to life. Special emphasis  in this regard should be put on the right to development  a fundamentalhuman right which  by its very nature  conditions the degreeand the modus of realization of the other human rights —political  civil  social  cultural and economic rights.Much talk has been heard on the issue of humanrights. It is not enough  however  to proclaim such rights orto brag about them without at the same time ensuring theconditions  including the economic conditions  for theireffective implementation  a task that especially requiresaction on the part of the United Nations system and theinternational community in general.The people of East Timor are still deprived of theirfundamental rights  especially the inalienable right todispose of their own destiny. Cape Verde  in keeping withthe United Nations principles it has always upheld  onceagain emphasizes the need for the observance of andrespect for the right of self-determination of the EastTimorese people  and encourages the efforts undertaken bythe international community  under the authority of theSecretary-General  with a view to protecting and promotinghuman rights in that territory  and finding a lasting solutionthat is acceptable.As we approach the next millennium  our countries arefaced with daunting challenges  and the Organization  whichhas unequivocally scored some successes  should be capableof coping with a rejuvenated role  one which should beincreasingly more humane and reflecting more solidarity aimed at the effective implementation of the lofty idealsthat are its foundation."

What positive contributions can wemake to the new horizon that is opening up in the annalsof history?Undoubtedly  the very existence of the UnitedNations constitutes a most positive element. In 1945  thisOrganization emerged as a successor  on a larger scale  tothe ideal of peace embodied in the League of Nations.The 51 countries represented in San Francisco aspired tobuild a world in which harmony would prevail and whereinternational security would be supported by a far moresolid foundation. Today  in this Hall  almost all thecountries of the world are represented â€” we hope that inthe near future there will be no exceptions â€” and each ofthem has taken upon itself the obligation to abide by thepurposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter.Under the vigorous leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt the members of the Commission on Human Rights of theEconomic and Social Council worked untiringly  freelyand openly discussing the subject  and trying toharmonize approaches that encompassed both Westernhumanism and the ancient philosophy of the East. Thefruit of their efforts was the adoption  on 10 December1948  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.26During those bitter years  when the shadows left bythe worldwide conflagration had not yet cleared  and thoseof the bipolar confrontation were already looming  somebelieved that the Declaration was a pleasant  romantic andentirely unrealistic suggestion.Others saw it  on the contrary  as our speciesâ besthope  in the conviction that international relations haveethical value only insofar as they guarantee the dignity ofhuman beings  which is our very essence as rationalcreatures  through respect for our natural attributes. As theformer President of Chile  Mr. Eduardo Frei Montalva oncestated  the ratification of the Declaration was ademonstration of faith in peace  faith in the peoples of theworld and faith in moral progress.I am proud to be able to say that Costa Ricaenthusiastically supported the Declaration; since then  CostaRica has expressed its firm belief that human rights cannotbe subordinated to the interests of States. Today ourcountry is the seat of the Inter-American Court of HumanRights  the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights  andthe University for Peace of the United Nations. ThroughoutCosta Ricaâs history as a Member of the United Nations  ithas consistently been committed to the cause of humanrights  in both the international arena and the domesticsphere.On this occasion  I reiterate to the Assembly all CostaRicaâs firm  solemn and unconditional commitment tocontinue fighting actively  whenever and wherever  toachieve full respect for all human rights.Today my country reaffirms that its voice willcontinue to be heard in all forums on behalf of the nobleethical and moral ideals that we proclaimed 50 years ago.Perhaps the most important legacy that the UnitedNations of the twentieth century will leave to the UnitedNations of the twenty-first century will be the certitude thathuman rights are a matter of universal concern. Thisconviction has allowed the broad conceptual  legal andpolitical development of the subject of human rights. Wehave debated and signed pacts  conventions and protocolson increasingly specific aspects of human rights.Despite this prodigious pile of legal instruments humanity is still very far from having inscribed humanrights on its very spirit. In many aspects  the commitmentto an ethic of coexistence is as absent from the events oftoday as it was half a century ago.Costa Rica observes with regret the instances ofintolerance and violence that still persist in our world  theethnic  religious  cultural  national  ideological or genderdiscrimination: the conflicts in the Balkans  the tragicwars endured by some African peoples  the situation inAfghanistan and the savagery of terrorism in various partsof the world. We are extremely concerned by the limitedprogress of the Middle East peace process and theincreasing virulence of national extremism and religiousfanaticism in certain countries.My country believes that these serious problemsmust be faced from an ethical standpoint  with theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights as the basic codefor the conduct of both States and individuals.The legal validity of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights is no longer debated today. However  fora long time  doubts and objections were raised as to thepossibility of establishing mechanisms to guarantee it.Thanks to the efforts of many years  the UnitedNations now has a High Commissioner for HumanRights. My country is proud to have been one of the mainsponsors of the establishment of that office.One of the most important events that has takenplace this year was the successful culmination of theeffort to establish an International Criminal Court.The valuable experience of the InternationalCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia â€” of whichthe Second Vice-President of Costa Rica  Judge ElizabethOdio  is a member â€” undoubtedly contributed tostrengthening the conviction on the need for a permanentcourt to try the most serious violations of human rights.My country embraces the adoption of the Statute ofthe International Criminal Court  which took place inRome on 17 July of this year  whereby the internationalcommunity rejects and condemns the most heinous crimesagainst our universal conscience. We are especiallypleased that the Rome Conference included within itsdefinition of crimes violations of the basic norms ofinternational humanitarian law  applicable both tointernational and internal conflicts. In addition  in thelight of the tragic experiences of some Latin Americancountries in the recent past  we are gratified by theinclusion of the legal definition of forced disappearance.I am pleased to announce that  in the coming days I will have the honour of signing the Courtâs Statute on27behalf of my country  and I express Costa Ricaâs firmintention to proceed with its speedy approval andratification.My country is convinced of the necessity to establisha commission that will prepare  before the year 2000  theessential conditions for the Statute to enter into force. CostaRica believes that the commission should be convened assoon as possible.This year  in addition to celebrating the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights my country will celebrate another anniversary which  forCosta Ricans  is no less important: the fiftieth anniversaryof the abolition of the Costa Rican army  decreed on 1December 1948. Only 10 days later  Costa Rica adopted theMagna Carta of international ethics  the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights.The abolition of the army was the culmination of mycountryâs long anti-militaristic history. In 1866  the thenPresident of Costa Rica  Mr. JosÃ© Mar'a Castro  stated thatone of the foundations of external peace is a strictadherence to international law  among whose prescriptions as listed by President Castro  are dignity  good faith  loyaltyand frankness. Today  as then  my country believes that inorder to invoke international law and aspire to be arespected and valued State without need of military support Costa Ricaâs principal duty is to govern its domestic andinternational conduct by a system of values that is groundedin the fundamental rights of individuals.As a result of its historical and moral tradition  CostaRica believes that there are no small countries when itcomes to consolidating and preserving peace. Such has beenCosta Ricaâs rule of conduct when it has had theopportunity  as it does now  to be a member of the SecurityCouncil.For this same reason  Costa Rica has tenaciouslysupported the work aimed at general disarmament  and inparticular the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and has vigorously condemned the carrying out of nucleartests. In that regard  my country urges all those States thathave not yet done so to adhere fully and unconditionally tothe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.Because of the values that have emerged from its ownexperience  Costa Rica has invariably repudiated terrorismin all its manifestations  wherever and by whomever it iscommitted. We do not believe that there is any justificationfor attacks against innocent people. Likewise  we condemnthose Governments that support  shelter and giveassistance to those who commit or instigate terrorist acts in clear violation of their international obligations.We believe that the international community mustmake special efforts to prevent and eliminate internationalterrorism. In this context  we stress the recent negotiationson an International Convention for the Suppression ofTerrorist Bombings  and we urge Member States to signit. We also trust that during this session of the GeneralAssembly decisive progress can be made on thepreparation of an international convention for thesuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. My delegationwishes to express how deeply pleased it is that theConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction is to enter into force within six months.My country urges all those States that have not yet doneso to accede to that Convention as soon as possible.We are pleased to see that in Central America â€”notwithstanding the conflicts and the turmoil that ourcountries faced during the last decade â€” there are signsof progress towards the elimination or substantialreduction of military expenditures. Some countries haveeliminated their armed forces  and others have reducedthem significantly. Costa Rica does not intend to eitherexport or impose any models on others  but it warmlyapplauds the decision of these brother countries.The international community should acknowledge thespecific progress that has been made in reducing militaryexpenses by developing countries. In this spirit  CostaRica wishes to propose the creation of a special fund forCentral America  which would be established throughcontributions of developed countries and organizations.The idea would be that each dollar not spent on militarybudgets would be at least matched by contributions forsocial development programmes to strengthen democraticsystems in our region.The Central American peace process has been one ofthe most successful ones of recent times. Only a decadeago  in this same Hall  we were exhausting ourselvesdiscussing and commenting on the effects of the CentralAmerican crisis. Today  our countries rarely make theheadlines of the international press. However  we wouldlike to stress that  notwithstanding Central Americaâs hugesocial and economical problems  it resolutely continues towork to consolidate for its children a more dignified andfreer way of life  more in accordance with the spirit ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have28progressed in the areas of electoral democracy and freedomof expression. Now the time has come to consolidateparticipatory democracy. Therefore  at the end of thiscentury and of the millennium  Costa Rica has begun aprocess of national political dialogue  with broad popularparticipation  in order to strengthen our more than 100-year-old democracy.The Central American countries have workedstrenuously for the integration and liberalization of oureconomies. We have achieved important progress in ourintegration mechanisms and structural adjustment processes.We are participating actively in the negotiations aimed atcreating a free-trade area throughout the Americas  and wecontinue to maintain a policy of openness and commerciallinks among the Latin American countries.Despite the regional efforts to redraft its economicplans and to adapt them to the world marketâs requirements Costa Rica views with apprehension the creation ofeconomic unions or commercial blocks that beget newdiscrimination against third countries. Similarly  newconditionalities in the commercial policy of theindustrialized economies and the use of managed-trademechanisms are a clear impediment to the ideal of freetrade and create new inequalities of access to the worldeconomy.At the same time  we observe that  while the globaltrade in raw materials and agricultural products is losing itsvigour  the exchange of high-technology goods is growingstronger. This means that the portion of trade traditionallycarried out by the developing countries is becoming weakerin the global context. In this regard  Costa Rica urges theopening of markets  not only of the small economies  butalso of the large and industrialized economies. Costa Ricaalso advocates commitment to the ideal of free trade thatgave birth to the World Trade Organization and respect forits rules and resolutions in order to create an internationalenvironment more propitious for developing countriesâeconomic progress.Free trade encourages economic growth  and economicfreedom encourages the creation of wealth within thenations. In accordance with these principles  my countryundertook  in 1997  the chairmanship of the negotiatingprocess for the free-trade zone of the Americas  and we aretrying to contribute dynamically to its progress.We are also making efforts to attain fair and non-discriminatory access for Central American products tomarkets in the United States and the European Union â€”the regionâs principal trade partners. In both markets  ourcountries have been negatively affected by the diversionof trade and investment that have resulted from thegranting of preferential concessions to third countries which are displacing our main exports. We refute the neo-protectionist arguments of the groups who are trying toobstruct the access of Central American products to thosemarkets. For this reason  we are promoting thestrengthening of the Caribbean Basin Initiative in order tocorrect those diversions and inequities. Furthermore  webelieve there should be better opportunities for ourexports to the European Union through its generalizedpreferences system. We are also promoting tariffreduction for agricultural products in all the industrializedcountries.At the same time  Costa Rica urges industrializednations to cooperate with the efforts to strengthen theinternational financial institutions in order to ensure thestability of the world financial system. Institutions such asthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank andregional entities such as the Inter-American DevelopmentBank must provide support to overcome the crises thatcause financial instability  especially in the emergingmarkets.While some believe that economic profit and ethicshave nothing to do with each other  experience has shownus otherwise. Capitalism without rule of law and notsubject to ethical rules usually causes scourges such asthe spread of drug-trafficking  the reign of organizedcrime and corruption.My country  like many others  has been affected bythese phenomena. Mr. Miguel Angel RodrÃ­guezEcheverr'a  President of Costa Rica  is activelyparticipating in both the fight against and the preventionof these scourges  and he gave proof of his commitmentto this cause when he contributed to the success of therecent special session of the General Assembly on drug-trafficking. For Costa Rica  these struggles can be wononly if they have a solid ethical foundation. Genuineethical leadership can do more for the long-lasting andsustainable prosperity of a society than the best laws andthe most detailed treaties.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is notonly a statement of rights  it is also a clear statement ofevery human beingâs duties to the community. One of thefundamental obligations of all persons is to behavefraternally with their fellow men and the environment.29Costa Rica has not been exempt from the problemscaused by environmental degradation. However  mycountryâs authorities and many organizations of our civilsociety are working strenuously to solve them. In arelatively short time  we Costa Ricans have achieved majorprogress in the task of recovering and preserving our richbiodiversity  while at the same time transforming it into asource of income. For example  Costa Rica is today one ofthe developing countries that has undertaken a leading rolein carbon-fixation projects. We have negotiated importantbilateral agreements based on the filtration capability of ourforests. Those agreements have allowed us to become thefirst country to issue â€œsale of oxygenâ€ certificates asspecific proof of the quantity of captured emissions.My country has been the recipient of importantinternational cooperation programmes. In many areas wecontinue needing them. Nevertheless  we firmly believe thatcooperation is a two-way street in which we can all teachand learn  give and receive. Costa Rica believes that itsexperience in ecological matters may be useful to manyother countries and it makes it available to the internationalcommunity.Furthermore  my country would like to express its firmintention to offer technical cooperation for development  inthe modest measure of its capabilities  through the action ofa specialized office that is being established for such apurpose. Thanks to this office  Costa Ricans will share withother nations our experiences in the areas of health education  ecology  human rights and electoraldevelopment.For Costa Rica  the respect for diversity consecratedin the Universal Declaration must be an essentialcharacteristic of the Member States of the United Nations.In this regard  we are always conscious of the valuablelesson of the African thinker  Salif Tall Tierno-Bokar  whenhe taught that the rainbow owes its beauty to the variedtones of its colours in the same way that the voices ofvarious believers make up a harmony that rises up todivinity.The survival of the human species cannot be based ona system of separate existences. Since human beings firstappeared on the face of the earth  they must have had anawareness of their individual limitations and must haveunderstood that they could not survive without the othermembers of their species. Today  such natural wisdom ofour far-distant ancestors continues to be valid. We must livein community in order to build the future.The concept of love for our fellow men is at thecore of all religions. The ancient texts of the greatmasters of China  Mexico and India  and the Torah  theGospel and the Koran  regardless of any differences  areall permeated with a deep sense of identity amongindividuals.Moral and spiritual perfection  the dream of so manythinkers and the innermost aspiration of so many peoples cannot be reached without a basis in the constructive andfraternal coexistence of all the nations.At this moment in history  we the people whoinhabit the earth must create a civilization of peace andsolidarity. The twenty-first century should be the centuryof the culture of peace  which is also the culture offreedom  tolerance and solidarity."
"41",1727,"CUB",53,1998,"“To be or not to be.”Never before has Shakespeare?s famous dilemmabeen so valid. Half the world is shuddering with thecollapse of the stock exchanges  from Tokyo to Rio  fromMoscow to Buenos Aires  from London to Johannesburg and even right here in New York. We  the other half  arealso shuddering  not because of stock exchanges andsecurities that we do not possess  but because the entireburden of the global financial crash falls mercilessly onus  and nobody  absolutely nobody  is safe.The long-predicted Armageddon has arrived  and notjust in a Hollywood movie. The huge global trap that ourincreasingly distressed planet has become does not issuelicences for survival to countries or businesses. It doesnot provide protection from acid rain or the impacts of ElNiño  nor does it abide by or believe in ideologies andcultures. It does not offer life jackets to speculators ormega-owners.As in the times of slavery  human beings havebecome mere commodities  engrossed in buying andselling each other instead of learning how to enjoy anddefend their rights  while poisonous luxuries  the enemiesof liberty  corrupt individuals and societies and depriveentire peoples of their national identity.The inevitable globalization that we should havereached through fraternity  solidarity and cooperation hascome upon us in such neoliberalized form that the liberaleconomic thinking that gave rise to it cannot even berecognized in this new dogma.34The process of globalization and neoliberalinternationalization of the world economy has todaymultiplied the advantages for developed countries to thedetriment of the increasingly underdeveloped economies.This makes them more vulnerable to external factorsbeyond their control  such as the excruciating burden offoreign debt  increasingly unequal rates of exchange  thewidening technological gap and the persistent decline in theprice of commodities  in the context of a ruthless speculative and hopelessly inhuman market.The inequitable trade relationship between rich andpoor  more akin to theft or swindle than trade  is a basicelement that explains this. According to InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) data only 0.2 per cent annual growthrate has been seen in non-fuel commodities between 1989and 1998  while manufactured products grew at a rate of0.9 per cent. How could economies whose terms of tradedeteriorated  during that same period  at an annual rate of0.4 per cent and whose currencies were severely devaluatedbe expected to grow?The excruciating weight of foreign indebtedness — aphenomenon that has become eternal with the increase ofinequitable trade — rose from $1.118 trillion in 1989 to$1.875 trillion in 1998  for an annual average increase of 6per cent. What counts is money and finance  notdevelopment or human well-being.Neoliberal globalization and some of its basiccomponents  such as the liberalization of trade and freecompetition  do not in themselves mean that there will bean acceleration of economic growth or development inunderdeveloped countries. At the same time  unrestrainedderegulation and privatization have removed from theagenda the required protection for goods  services andworkers in the third world.Unfair equal treatment is being granted to economiesthat by their very nature  characteristics and volume areunequal. Tariff barriers are being replaced with more subtleand politically optional methods of protectionism  while aclub of selected owners  transnational corporations andGovernments negotiate  behind the backs of the vastmajority  a multilateral investment agreement that gives thedefinitive seal of approval to subservience and exclusion.There is no need for any special telescope to find thefamous black holes that swallow stars in outer space. Theworst black hole of them all can be found right here onEarth  right before our very eyes  where there was first agap and then an abyss  where the wealth of the rich grewin step with the poverty of the poor.International cooperation and official aid fordevelopment  funnelled through different organizations ofthe United Nations system  are tending to decrease considerably affecting the efficiency and effectiveness ofthe system?s work in the field of development.Even worse  we see attempts to further conditionsuch aid to political demands that injure national Statesand undermine the sovereignty of countries and peoples.Furthermore  such attempts erode the authority ofGovernments by determining their development policies which directly affects democratic governance. They alsobring about the resurgence of diseases that we thoughthad been eradicated  generating high mortality rates andpremature aging of the world population. These are soillegitimate that no one should support them.We  the victims  cannot be expected think as ourvictimizers do. As Comrade Fidel Castro said only a fewweeks ago at the twelfth Summit of the Non-AlignedMovement “it is not possible to acquiesce in a world orderwhich embodies to the utmost the highest principlesand purposes of a system that for centuriescolonized  enslaved and plundered us all”.Because these nations are so disunited  we have notbeen able to elude the ravages of neoliberal globalization which is so alien in spirit to the groundbreakingDeclaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen andcontrary to the very letter of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights  which in a few weeks will be 50 yearsold. Against all logic  it is in our meetings  committeesand other forums that the prerogatives to which we areentitled as human beings are being reduced to merecaricatures in an insane race to alter the very foundationsof international law.We are constantly asked why we so stubbornly callfor the genuine democratization of the United Nations andfor far-reaching reform of its institutions. What does ittake to understand that  when we are on the verge ofbidding farewell to the second millennium  the world canno longer be forced to follow Bretton Woods norms patterns and schemes that are consistent with a worldorder born out of a war and that are now obsolete.35The Dow Jones average sways and plummets just afew blocks away from this building. Uncertainty andhopelessness are rampant in the markets. Countries aregoing bankrupt — and so are their Governments. Hundredsof millions die of famine  disease  violence  terror and war.Some even become living dead  as they are deprived oftheir national identity. But we are expected to accept thathere in the General Assembly those who unleashed thismadness are destroying the only truly democratic spacewhere we can act together.How much longer are we going to allow them tocontinue imposing conditions  unilaterally launchingmissiles  improving their nuclear arsenals and testing new“smart weapons”  while they demand disarmament from thepoor and the illiterate? And further  they are preventing usfrom doing away with the dictatorship of a Security Councilwhich refuses to expand or to give up or modify the powerof veto? There can be no talk of a Security Council thatprovides legitimacy  let alone security  so long as that bodyfails to abide by the powers conferred upon it in ArticleXXIV of the Charter; so long as it ignores the powers ofother United Nations bodies; so long as its compositionremains inequitable; so long as each and every memberdoes not enjoy identical rights; so long as we in the thirdworld  the overwhelming majority of the world?spopulation  are not duly represented.For Cuba  the one steadfast and sincere thing to do isto alert the world to which we belong  and to struggle forthe values of freedom  justice  dignity and humanitarianismthat we believe in and uphold. These are the values thatshould prevail for the sake of our endangered humanspecies. It is for this end that the resources made availableto the United Nations by its Member States should be used.Enough of politicizing budgets under the pretext ofalleged cost-effectiveness — as if the millions of Africanchildren dying of curable diseases  the millions of illiteratepeople in Latin America  or the millions of peopledisplaced by conflicts in Asia and the Middle East werebolts of cloth  raw materials or spent fuel.Enough of the appalling facts cited in the latestHuman Development Report  issued two weeks ago  whichaffirms that the barest consumption needs of over a billionpeople are not being met at all  and that more than 4 billionpeople lack essential health services and 2 billion sufferfrom anaemia  including 55 million in industrializedcountries.Enough of accepting that the indicators of humanconsumption in 70 countries have dropped below thelevels of 25 years ago.Enough of accepting that a child born in a developedcountry will consume and pollute in his or her lifetime asmuch as 50 children born in an underdeveloped country.Enough of accepting that three individuals in thisworld have amassed fortunes equivalent to the total grossdomestic product of 48 States.Enough of accepting that the most powerful andwealthy nation on Earth  with the highest per capitaincome  should  according to the report  have the highestrates of human poverty.Enough of demagogy. Let us make way for ethics generosity and humanitarianism. Let the debts be paid andthe current scale of assessments maintained. Let us put anend to special United Nations peacekeeping operationsand to the arms market they have generated  and let usstrengthen the actions of the World Health Organization the United Nations Children?s Fund  the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  theFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations the United Nations Development Programme  the Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugeesand the many other agencies that have truly endeavouredthroughout their existence to assert the rights of everyhuman being. That is the only really fair  responsible andhumane thing to do.In other words  let us not allow so many children todie in the next few hours  days  months and years — suchas the 108 217 infants under five years of age  who havedied of preventable causes in the underdeveloped worldsince we opened the fifty-third session last Monday without the Assembly or the international community ofnations being able to do anything about it.Let us keep the voice and mandate of the peoplesand Governments that make up the United Nations frombeing drowned out by the inhumane interests of themasters and their partners grouped in the “Washingtonconsensus”  which is how chaste  scholarly jargoncurrently defines the alliance of countries andinternational financial institutions that have dragged us allinto disastrous unipolar neoliberalization ruled by aunique and criminal way of thinking which hypocriticallyboasts of being pluralistic.36Let us prevent heinous and disgusting phenomena suchas terrorism from being fostered in that way; both theterrorism that constantly takes innocent lives — whichmany seek to compare with the fight of other peoples thathave employed humanitarian and worthy methods in theirresort to weapons in order to win their rights — and theother much more sophisticated  computerized andglobalized terrorism that turns the economy  politics andideas into a lethal weapon to secure the interests of arestricted circle of selfish people who believe it is theirprerogative to unilaterally impose their laws and theirpunishments on others.We recognize that drafting and implementinginternational treaties are instrumental in our struggle againstterrorism. But if we are truly committed to achieving thatgoal  then the power to investigate  prevent and punishthese acts must be assumed seriously by States as anobligation which may not be delegated. There must begenuine cooperation to apprehend perpetrators  and Statesmust prevent by all means possible terrorist acts againstother States being organized  encouraged  funded ortolerated within their territory.Cuba  which has suffered from terrorism and to whichnothing that is human is alien  cannot but unequivocallycondemn such actions  methods and practices. Above all we denounce those responsible for fomenting  supporting funding  masterminding  propagating or tolerating theseloathsome actions  which  as recent events have illustrated turn their perpetrators into heinous Saturns  capable ofdevouring their own children.For almost 40 years our homeland has had to defenditself from aggression and harassment of all kinds: dirtywar  mercenary invasions  nuclear threat  veritable huntsorganized in attempts to murder our main leaders  pirateattacks  constant acts of sabotage against our industry  ouragriculture and our economy  blowing up of airliners inflight — as occurred in Barbados on 6 October 1976; overa thousand hours a week of subversive radio and televisiontransmissions which illegally invade our radio-electronicspace; and biological warfare. Our tourist facilities haveendured terrorist attacks  employing Central Americanmercenaries  organized and financed from the United States with the full awareness and tolerance of the authorities ofthat country. Furthermore  we are also currently facingfurther American criminal legislation aimed at intensifyingthe dirtiest and longest economic war ever perpetratedagainst any country. This is why we can speak about theseissues with absolute morality.I must say at least a few words about recentaccusations by the United States of alleged Cubanespionage activities in Florida  which have been widelydisseminated by the mass media as somethingextraordinary. I am sure the Assembly understands thatthe most ridiculous and laughable thing to occur in recentdays in this nation of scandals is that the world?s biggestspy  the United States  has accused of espionage theworld?s most spied upon country  Cuba.The reality we live in is not recognized in thecurrent Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Nobodydenies that this is a document of universal scope  theoutcome of the most progressive thinking of its time andthe international culmination of certain trends and valuesthat emerged from the horrors of the Second World War.However  it should not be forgotten that when weembraced it in 1948 almost two thirds of humanity stilllived under the colonial and neo-colonial yoke. All thosecountries had been reduced to mere objects ofinternational law. For them  the most traumatic experiencewas not the war but underdevelopment  political exclusionand the new and even more catastrophic economic battlesimposed upon them.While we uphold the values of our 50-year-oldDeclaration  values which cannot be renounced  and rejectattempts to cause confusion over it and give it anideological and political nature  we must have the courageand awareness to recognize its historical and conceptuallimitations  which illustrate that the time has come todraft a new international charter of human rights capableof meeting the requirements of the new millennium.If we do not do this now  what will be the use of allthe efforts made five years ago at the Vienna WorldConference on Human Rights to adopt a Declaration anda Programme of Action? What will we tell our peoples?Is it not the duty of democratic Governments to beaccountable to their voters for the discharge of theirinternational obligations? Will we finally recognize theright to development as a fundamental  universal andinalienable human right? Will unrelenting reality persuadeus that the universality  indivisibility and interdependenceof all human rights requires the acknowledgment ofnational and regional characteristics and diverse historical cultural and religious heritages  as well as the need tostrengthen international cooperation concerning this issueobjectively and without selectivity?37The establishment of the Office of the HighCommissioner and other steps taken in this regard are justfig leaves that fail to conceal all the embarrassing parts.Many goals have yet to be reached  such as thedemand of the Vienna Conference that all States abstainfrom adopting unilateral measures contrary to internationallaw and the Charter of the United Nations which hindertrade relations and impede the full realization of the rightsset forth in the Universal Declaration and its internationalinstruments  particularly the right of all people to livingstandards adequate for their health and well-being —including nourishment  health care  housing and basic socialservices.What will we do to those who violate this mandate?Do we summon them to an international criminal tribunal?Under what charges: contempt for democratic decisions;State terrorism; war Crimes; genocide?It would seem that the disturbing words of the writerand humanist John Milton are true:“They who have put out the people?s eyes  reproachthem of their blindness.”I say this because the United States Government hasignored all those complaints in the same way as it hasdrafted lists of presumed violators.In a blatant challenge to the international community the advocates of open markets and the end of ideologieshave taken additional and distinctly extraterritorial actionsaimed at reinforcing their blockade. I ask the interpreters tobe accurate: I mean blockade and not embargo. It is aneconomic  trade and financial blockade against Cuba thatignores six consecutive calls by the Assembly to put an endto what has rightly been fairly described as the grossest most serious and systematic violation of the human rightsof a whole people.On the contrary  those concerned insist on continuingtheir failed policy  one of whose instruments wasexemplarily dismantled by the international community atthe fifty-fourth session of the Commission on HumanRights  when it was decided to put an end to theextraordinary procedure on the so-called situation of Cubaand to get rid of the Special Rapporteur. That was aconscious and considered decision  the ultimate assertion ofthe growing rejection of a politicized resolution that shouldnever have existed in the first place. It was recognition ofthe truth and a result of the weariness caused by calumnyand lies. It was also the way out of a discriminatory unwarranted and selective exercise targeted on Cuba thatconsecrated the imperial will to dictate a kind ofinternational law where the powerful and wealthy judgeand we  the poor  are doomed to sit on the defendants?bench.Nevertheless  we have amassed enough evidence toindicate that a new vendetta is under way. The failedattempts last July in the Economic and Social Council toimposed a so-called joint statement on the presumedhuman rights situation in Cuba  and subsequent initiativesto engage high United Nations authorities or particularcountries in the preposterous and unsuccessful task of thelate Special Rapporteur  foreshadow new and unwarrantedconflicts that will again divert the Organization from itsmain concerns.I am referring to documents and guidelines such asthese  which I could quote and which will be madeavailable to the press  and which have been forwarded toalmost all participants in this room by senior officials ofa Government that  in keeping with its imperialphilosophy  seems to think that they are entitled to speakbut not required to listen humbly and respectfully. I quotefrom the document:“Multilateral efforts suffered a serious setback lastApril when the United Nations Commission onHuman Rights voted against a resolution on Cuba bya margin of 19 to 16  with 18 abstentions.”“Maintaining international focus on the human rightssituation in Cuba is a high priority for Secretary ofState Albright. She has asked me to speak with youour interest in pursuing a joint statement on Cuba atECOSOC.”“We feel that the most effective approach would bea joint statement of like-minded countries. Thestatement could call on the United Nations system tokeep the human rights situation in Cuba underreview. One mechanism for doing so could be theestablishment in Havana of an office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights”.The general thrust is clear.We take full responsibility in asserting thatreconsidering the issue will only mean opening yetanother  even more unacceptable chapter in the politicalmanipulation of human rights mechanisms. This would be38detrimental to the authority of the body or the relevantoffice  because our country would not accept thereimposition of any new procedure or discriminatorytreatment.Everything we do in Cuba  whether some like it ornot  whether agreed or not  is done for the sake of thehuman being. We are proud of our reality and  as we havesaid before  we do not believe it is perfect. We do not wantit to be perfect. We do not want to be bored withperfection. We do not take it as an endorsement or exportit as a model  and above all we do not impose it on anyone so no one will attempt to impose their reality on us.We do not use our agreements or disagreements withothers  including our differences with the very harsh silenced reality of our accusers  to humiliate or condemnanyone. We prefer to discuss them by means of civilizeddialogue  which we are at all times prepared to engage in believing that what really matters is cooperation and not theimposition of a dubious convergence in positions.Cuba is among the few Members of this Organizationthat has consistently submitted its reports systematically andin good time to the treaty bodies to which it belongs.Evidence abounds of the transparency and sincerity of ouractions and of the strength with which we upholdimpartiality and objectivity in the Committees on theElimination of Discrimination against Women  theCommittee against Torture  the Committee on the Rights ofthe Child and the Committee on the Elimination of RacialDiscrimination.We have similar credentials in our systematiccooperation with the various mechanisms of theCommission on Human Rights and with the Office of theHigh Commissioner  since its inception. Let me mentionalso our growing bilateral cooperation in this area withvarious States in an atmosphere of respect and on an equalfooting  each one of us with our respective virtues andflaws.For these reasons  while we denounce these newintentions and forewarn the Assembly against unwarranted diversionist and fruitless exercises  we reiterate Cuba?sunrestricted willingness and preparedness for dialogue andfor multilateral and bilateral cooperation with all States.No imposed solution can settle a problem. Theinternational community should never allow a cause asnoble and compelling as that of human rights to be heldhostage to petty political interests.Cuba is confident that dialogue will prevail overconfrontation and recalls  as a token of its goodwill  theinvitations it has extended to the thematic rapporteurs onviolence against women  on children  on mercenarypractices and on other matters  so they can becomeacquainted with the realities of a socialism that has neverneeded to proclaim its intrinsic humanity. Unfortunately however  on occasions when it has broadly disseminatedthe required information with transparency  thatinformation has at times been manipulated and used toserve the interests and objectives of our aggressors.So long as Cuban children suffering from leukemiaare denied access to Oncaspar and L-Spar to prolong theirlives; so long as Cuban AIDS patients are denied accessto AZT; so long as urgently needed purchases ofrespirators for newborn babies in intensive care units arehampered; so long as it is forbidden to sell to Cuba asingle pound of metrotrexate to test important medicinesagainst cancer; so long as a 33 per cent drop in thepopulation?s daily consumption of calories and a 39 percent drop in the consumption of proteins is artificially andintentionally provoked by a ban on food exports  byexcessive freight costs and prices  and by the harassmentof suppliers; so long as attempts are made to starve us todeath and to kill us with diseases  while speculation andmanipulation is under way with feigned official aidpresented as a humanitarian gesture  which we refusebecause we believe it to be insincere; as long as letterssuch as the one I am holding — I feel compelled to showthem  and they will be made available to all —unilaterally justify confusing  contradictory andthreatening understandings aimed at globalizingextraterritorial laws  it would be absolutely outrageous immoral and even shameful to question Cuba?s just andsovereign limits  legitimized by the 1948 UniversalDeclaration itself  that our Government and people areforced to place on those who  wielding human rights inthe abstract  defame their homeland  disown their people foster division and serve the interests of a foreign Power.I quote from the letter from Mrs. Albright to SenatorJesse Helms:“The understanding is an important stepforward in our ongoing efforts to encourage greaterrespect for property rights of United States citizensabroad.“We expect the full cooperation of theEuropeans in carrying out the understanding.39“It is important that we not miss this unique andhistoric opportunity to advance the goals of theLibertad Act and to establish broad new protectionsfor the property rights of United States citizens inCuba and throughout the world.”Certainly  this is worthy of note. What Mrs. Albrightcalls the Libertad Act in her letter is nothing but theregrettably notorious Act that has often been repudiated bythe international community: the Helms-Burton Act. I amclarifying this because I know that for most of the membersof this Assembly it would be difficult to equate a juridicalinstrument of this type with a lofty but often misused wordsuch as “freedom”.A self-respecting nation does not allow its dignity andintelligence to be offended. A people that has fought andendured such a barbaric onslaught will never be brought toits knees. A people that exists today because it has learnedto overcome its difficulties will never be shattered  let aloneconvinced of the urgency of any cause besides the revolt ofthe united.We the poor are so many and our poverty so great thatif we unite  the unity of our poverty will become ourgreatest asset. This will be our wealth  and we have morethan enough poverty to become immensely rich.Let us set aside our differences. Let us carry on ourshoulders the salvation of humanity. Let us gather thosewho  resourceful and wealthy though they may be  can stillfeel in their hearts the urgent call for survival in the globalera.Let the world recognize our sincere vote as poorpeople  and if there is no other choice  let it hear our vetoas well. Let us all unite in the struggle. As President FidelCastro has said  Cuba will never tire of calling for this. Letus unite and globalize our opposition to every boastful actof hegemony.Let us globalize respect for our human condition which is the first and foremost right to be claimed. Let usglobalize the efforts to save from ecological catastrophe aplanet that has been ruined by neoliberalism andconsumerism.Let us globalize ethics  culture and the spirituality ofpeoples in their immense and wonderful diversity  so thateach of us can drink from his own spring and we can pourour clearest waters into the great river of human thought.Let us globalize  without excluding anyone  science technology  development and cooperation betweennations. Let the rich share their wealth. Let the poorgrow  the illiterate learn to read and write  the sick heal.Let the healthy remain healthy and the hungry have food.Let us globalize generosity and eradicate plundering selfishness and greed.Let us globalize respect for the rights of others as aguarantee of peace for all races  ethnicities and religions so that we may bid farewell to arms.Let us globalize human freedom as the most sacredtrait of our species. Let this be a responsible freedom with peace and independence  dignity and sovereignty without humiliation or conditions  without alterations orrenunciations — a freedom emerging from the rebellionof human beings against a world that no longer meetstheir needs and that they are determined to change  as setout in the preamble and article 28 of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. We do not want thesefreedoms ever to be politicized; we want them to remainentirely human.In a few days it will be 40 years since the dawn ofCuba's knowledge of that freedom that re-established therights of Cubans and enshrined our humanity  becausethat freedom was born in our own breasts and nourishedby the blood  sweat  efforts and sacrifices of so manygenerations.That freedom is still alive today  shielded by an all-enduring unity. It encourages our rebelliousness in theface of a world that deserves to be and can be changedfor the sake of all mankind. As the book of Ecclesiastescommands:“To every thing there is a season  and a time toevery purpose under the heaven.” (The Holy Bible Ecclesiastes 3:1)Now is the time and the exact hour that we must act."
"42",1773,"CYP",53,1998,"I would like to extend mywarmest congratulations to you  Sir  on your election asPresident of this body. I have no doubt that yourdiplomatic experience and proven leadership will guide ussuccessfully in our work.Allow me also to thank your predecessor Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine  for the determinedleadership with which he steered the work of the fifty-second session.The United Nations  being the primary vehicle forthe pursuit of world peace  has striven throughout itsexistence to make the world a better place to live in.Despite adversities of all kinds  caused particularly byopposing national interests  violent conflicts  naturaldisasters and the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  the United Nations has pursued consistentlythe noble goals enshrined in its Charter  first and foremostthe elimination of the scourge of war and the achievementof economic development.To be realistic  however  the hopes of mankind fora new and genuinely just international legal and politicalorder  generated by the demise of the bipolar world  areyet to be realized.Cyprus reaffirms its commitment to work closelywith the other members of the Organization for theattainment of our common goals. We support  therefore the reform efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi3Annan  to streamline the operations of the Organization ina way that assures its ability to pursue its goals  meet newchallenges and safeguard its financial position. We stressonce more the importance of restructuring the SecurityCouncil to make it more representative and transparent.Cyprus welcomes the adoption of the Statute of apermanent International Criminal Court  empowering it tobring to justice the perpetrators of most serious crimes andviolations of humanitarian law. In this respect  we considerthe first-ever judgement by the international criminal courtfor Rwanda on the crime of genocide a very important step.Of special concern is the rising number of refugeesand internally displaced persons. Their plight calls not onlyfor international cooperation in providing protection andhumanitarian assistance  but also for addressing the rootcauses of displacement. We continue to believe that the bestsolution is the return of refugees to their homes inconditions of safety  with full protection of their humanrights.Cyprus condemns terrorism  which it considers amenace to humanity  requiring effective international actionand solutions on the basis of international law and theCharter of the United Nations.The situation in the Middle East continues to becharacterized by lack of progress and obstacles to theimplementation of the peace accords. The current stalemateposes a threat to the stability of the region. Cyprus  aneighbouring State with close relations to the partiesinvolved  reiterates its support for the achievement of a just lasting and comprehensive settlement based on the relevantUnited Nations resolutions.I would like to reiterate my country?s support for thedocuments adopted at the General Assembly special sessionon the world drug problem and for the relevant efforts ofthe United Nations.Cyprus welcomes the recent report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Africa. His recommendationsmerit serious consideration and support by the internationalcommunity. We believe that the international communityshould redouble its efforts towards assisting Africancountries  with special attention given to debt relief  so thatthey can avoid further instability and the danger ofmarginalization.Cyprus joined in the worldwide rejoicing over theagreement of last April concerning Northern Ireland. It isimportant for the sides to honour their responsibilities andmeet their commitments. We condemn acts of violence which should not be allowed to block the road to peace reconciliation and prosperity.Cyprus supports strongly the efforts in the area ofarms control and disarmament. Since my last appearancebefore this body  we have ratified the Chemical WeaponsConvention; we have also signed  and will soon ratify  theConvention on anti-personnel mines. I should emphasizein this respect that  in spite of the difficult situation weface because of the presence of an occupation army forceof 36 000 troops  Cyprus has decided to sign theConvention as an expression of our determination to jointhe forces struggling to eliminate this utterly cruel methodof war. We are grateful to Canada for promising tofinance the undertaking to clear the minefields along theceasefire line in our country.The United Nations has a special role to play in thepromotion of the well-being of small States. Small Statesare often exposed to a much greater degree than largerStates to threats because of increased vulnerability of theirenvironment and security.In this connection  Cyprus has suffered for morethan 24 years the grave consequences of the Turkishinvasion and the continuing occupation of more than onethird of its territory. Despite the pronounced will of theinternational community through numerous resolutionsand the willingness of the Greek Cypriot side to negotiatein good faith  no solution of the Cyprus problem hasresulted. It is  therefore  reasonable to ask why. Theanswer is: It is because of the non-implementation andflagrant violation of Security Council and GeneralAssembly resolutions by Turkey.I feel that it is necessary to give some examples ofthese flagrant violations which prevented solution of theCyprus problem. Security Council and General Assemblyresolutions calling for respect for the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and non-recognition of the Turkish Cypriot breakaway entity wereviolated by Turkey  which is the only State whichrecognized the Turkish Cypriot secessionist entity  andwhich sustains it financially and militarily.As regards Security Council and General Assemblyresolutions  calling for the speedy withdrawal of allforeign armed forces and personnel from the Republic ofCyprus  not only have the Turkish armed forces andpersonnel not been withdrawn  but they have been4increased and upgraded  to such an extent that the previousSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  described inhis report to the Security Council the occupied area ofCyprus as one of the most militarized areas in the world.United Nations resolutions for the return of therefugees to their homes under conditions of safety were notimplemented  not only because Turkish forces prevented therefugees from returning  but also because Turkey  violatingother provisions of United Nations resolutions calling on allparties concerned to avoid any action to change thedemographic composition of the population of Cyprus imported to Cyprus thousands of illegal settlers fromTurkey  usurped the properties of the refugees and installedsettlers in them. I could go on giving examples of grossviolations of United Nations resolutions by Turkey  but inorder to confine myself to the time limits allowed  I willrefer only to the latest violation.The recent demand of the Turkish Cypriot leader Mr. Denktas  in the presence of the Turkish ForeignMinister  violates all United Nations resolutions  which callfor a bizonal-bicommunal federation  with a singlesovereignty  international personality and citizenship  and isaimed at derailing the negotiating process from the base ofthe United Nations resolutions on Cyprus  and also atextinguishing the independence of the Republic of Cyprusand creating  under the guise of a Turkish CypriotRepublic  a Turkish colony in Cyprus or  to say the least a Turkish protectorate.The non-implementation of United Nations resolutionson Cyprus tarnishes the image of the United Nations and itsmain bodies. The former Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  in one of his reports to the Security Council identified as a cause of the absence of progress in Cyprusthe lack of political will on the part of the Turkish side.With that report the diagnosis of the causes of thefailure to make progress towards a solution is completed. Isit too much for the people of Cyprus to ask what the nextstep will be? Will the United Nations finally take thenecessary action to apply the required remedy in order toput an end to the tragedy that has befallen our small Stateand that has continued for 24 years?The international community should not allow oneState to violate for so long its expressed will. The SecurityCouncil  the main organ for international peace andsecurity  should proceed to examine how to implement itsresolutions as soon as possible.I now want to address the problem of Cyprus  not bylooking at the past  but by outlining my goals for thefuture. The Cyprus problem has been with us for over 40years. Today  the two communities of Cyprus are led bythe generation that was involved in the earliest stages ofthe Cyprus problem. This generation knows both the joysof friendships that crossed communal lines and thetragedies and suffering that also crossed communal lines.Rauf Denktas¸ and I are both members of thisgeneration  which has seen the best and the worst of therecent history of Cyprus. Our communities have entrustedus with their respective leaderships. The people ofCyprus  both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots  lookto us  their leaders  to help shape a future that is betterthan the present and that will not allow for a repetition ofthe past.Let me offer my vision for the future. I want allCypriots to have security in their homes and theircommunities; I want all Cypriots to pursue theirlivelihoods free of economic restrictions and the fear ofinstability; I want all Cypriot children to know theirdistinct cultural and religious heritage and to be able tocarry their identity and political rights into the futurewithout fear of domination from any quarter.The solution to any constitutional problem on thebasis of communal or ethnic criteria and federalismcontains elements of partnership and political equality ofthe constituent parts.The solution to the Cyprus problem on the basis ofa bicommunal-bizonal federation requires such apartnership of the two communities as wouldconstitutionally provide for a maximum degree of internalself-administration for the two constituent cantons provinces or States  and  adhering to the principle of theequal political status of the constituent parts  it mustprovide them with the same rights  powers and functionsregarding their respective separate  internal self-administration. The constitution must also provide foreffective participation of the constituent parts in thefederal government. It must also secure all fundamentalhuman rights and freedoms for all the citizens of thefederation. Above all  it must safeguard the singlesovereignty  the indivisibility and the unity of thebicommunal-bizonal federation. Such a federation becoming a member of the European Union  will thriveat home and abroad.5One of the questions we should ask when looking atvarious ideas for a solution is: Do they reasonably meet theneeds of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots  andwill they promote stability and encourage cooperation andpartnership among the people of Cyprus?It is obvious that a bicommunal solution must benegotiated  not only because all United Nations resolutionsso demand  but also because only in negotiations can wework out the practical steps needed to realize a functioningsolution.Security for both communities is a fundamental part ofany settlement; this will require arrangements special toCyprus. To be effective  an agreement to this end mustproduce a settlement that can meet the real life challengesinherent to a small island State.I believe that the gap between what ordinary TurkishCypriots and Greek Cypriots want and need in a settlementis not so great as it might appear. Both want the samethings: peace  prosperity  stability and physical  political economic and cultural security  including respect for andenjoyment of their homes and properties.I am confident that  working together under theumbrella of the United Nations and with the help of theinternational community  Greek Cypriots and TurkishCypriots can construct a settlement that meets these needsand removes the fears and insecurities that have plaguedCyprus since the middle part of this century. To do this  wemust begin serious negotiations.I believe that we  the current generation of leadership must negotiate a settlement to our decades-old problem thatwill give all the people of Cyprus a future that will ensurethat the bitter experiences of the past cannot and shall notbe repeated. We  the older generation of both communities must close this sad chapter of Cyprus?s history with anagreement between us which will allow generations to cometo build and realize the fruits of true partnership  based onmutual respect and political understanding.While we cannot reconcile ourselves with the Turkishinvasion and occupation  we are genuinely determined torenew and invigorate bicommunal confidence and trust cooperation and interaction with our Turkish Cypriotcompatriots. In my investiture speech last February  Iextended a hand of friendship and urged the TurkishCypriot leader  Mr. Denktas  to join me in working togethertowards finding a solution to the tragic problem of Cyprusfor the benefit of all the citizens of the island. Similarly  Iinvited the Turkish Cypriots to participate as fullmembers in the Cypriot delegation negotiating theaccession of Cyprus to the European Union  thus shapingtogether our positions and common destiny.Today  before the representatives of the internationalcommunity and from the podium of this Assembly adhering to the will of the international community for anagreed solution to the Cyprus problem within theparameters set forth in United Nations resolutions  asleader of the Greek Cypriot community  I renew myinvitation to the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community Mr. Rauf Denktas  to work together for the solution of theCyprus problem in order to build a happy and prosperousisland for our children and future generations. Theinterests of Cyprus lie in the unity and interaction of thetwo communities. The continuing tension prevents Cyprusand its people from assuming their rightful role andmaking their contribution to regional stability and theimprovement of Greco-Turkish relations.The Government of Cyprus is committed to apeaceful solution  on the basis of the United Nationsresolutions  which will safeguard the interests and thehuman rights of all its citizens.We have consistently put forward proposals for thereduction of tension on the island.Tension in Cyprus escalates because of the massivepresence of the Turkish occupation forces in the north their continuous strengthening and upgrading  and thecorresponding need the Government of the Republic feelsto strengthen its defences.The Security Council  recognizing that the increasein tension is due to the build-up of military forces  hascalled in a number of its resolutions for the reduction offorces and armaments.While the Government of the Republic of Cypruswill continue to exercise its sovereign right to strengthenits defences with whatever means it considers necessaryfor as long as Turkish occupation forces remain inCyprus  I have not failed  in response to Security Councilresolutions  to suggest concrete ways and measures towork for a specific programme of reduction of foreignand local forces and equipment as a necessary preparatorystep for the programmed and final withdrawal of allforeign forces and other elements and for thedemilitarization of Cyprus. These proposals andsuggestions  on our part  are still valid and timely  and as6such they remain on the negotiating table. We remaincommitted to a solution to the problem by peaceful means and for this a lessening of tension is a necessary ingredient.In the face of continuous threats against Cyprus by thevastly superior military might of Turkey  whose ultimateaim is to keep the island a perpetual hostage  to destroy itssovereignty and to reduce it to a Turkish protectorate  thestrong  principled support of United Nations Members is ofparamount importance.At this point  I wish to thank the Foreign Ministers ofthe five permanent members of the Security Council andthe Secretary-General for discussing the Cyprus problem on24 September 1998 and for issuing a statement calling foran early resumption of a sustained process of directnegotiations between the two communities  reminding themat the same time of the need to achieve a comprehensivepolitical settlement in accordance with Security Councilresolutions and to avoid any actions which might increasetension.I reply “Yes” to the resumption of a sustained processof direct negotiations on the basis of Security Councilresolutions; I reply “Yes” to avoiding any action that mightincrease tension and thus jeopardize progress in thenegotiating process.We trust that we can rely once again on the activesolidarity of Members at this crucial juncture  as the mostsacred principles of the United Nations Charter and thecredibility of the world public order itself come into focusin this respect.As we approach the new millennium  the leaders ofthe world must decide what kind of world we want ourchildren and grandchildren to live in. Is it a world of sheerinterests and lack of principles  where cold calculations ofeconomic and strategic interests are pre-eminent  or a worldgoverned by justice and respect for human rights  which isthe only solution for permanent peace and stability in theworld?"
"43",1797,"CZE",53,1998,"May I first congratulatethe President on his election to the presidency of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly and wish him everysuccess in this important position.I would also like to thank his predecessor Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  and praise him for the tirelessenergy he devoted to pushing through reform steps in theOrganization.The Assembly is meeting at a time when the world istroubled by many major problems. Let me mention sevenwhich I regard as crucial.The collapse of stock markets around the world triggered by the Asian and Russian crises  shows howvulnerable national economies are in our increasinglyglobalized economy.Recent nuclear tests conducted by States not parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) have jeopardized the progress made in arms controland non-proliferation since the end of the cold war progress which is vital if global peace is to be achieved.We have not yet been able to end wars in sub-SaharanAfrica and other parts of the world — including Europe and most notably in the former Yugoslavia  where theconflict in Kosovo remains unresolved.Terrorism continues to threaten individuals andGovernments. The attacks in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam arerecent examples of the death and destruction terroristscontinue to inflict on innocent people.Fundamental human rights and freedoms are still beingviolated and the human dignity of individuals is still beinghumiliated in many countries on all continents.The environment continues to be devastated by manyaspects of humankind?s activity  global warming being oneof the particularly ominous effects.And the gap between the rich and the poor is stillwidening despite many efforts to challenge hunger andpoverty in the developing world.To address and solve these and other problems international cooperation is essential. The traditionalplatform  the United Nations  remains the most suitablefor organizing the global efforts and resources needed forthis task. These issues are a tremendous challenge to theUnited Nations  and so it is essential that the capabilitiesof the United Nations be fully exploited. TheOrganization must respond to them with flexibility. Itmust provide realistic plans and procedures for dealingwith problems as they arise. And it must exploit thepolitical will necessary to implement programmes oncethey are put in place.A country?s international reputation is largelydependent on its domestic health. In my country  thisyear?s parliamentary elections resulted in a change ofGovernment. I wish to stress that the top foreign policypriorities of the Czech Republic — joining the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EuropeanUnion — stem from our desire to actively contribute tothe implementation of the vision of a united  democratic peaceful  socially just and prosperous Europe; a Europewithout tensions or conflicts; a Europe of free citizensand cooperating regions based on mutual solidarity human rights and cooperative security.The Czech Republic  Poland and Hungary areexpected to join the Alliance in 1999. The integration ofthese countries  we believe  will justify the enlargementof NATO and its contribution to European security. Weare keenly aware of our shared responsibility in thismatter. We expect NATO?s door to remain open for othercountries to join when they are ready. The Alliance?spresent role is not limited to safeguarding the vitalinterests of its members by means of collective defence.Over time it has made a contribution to global and pan-European security. We are sure that  in close collaborationwith other European security institutions — such as theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  the Western European Union and the Council ofEurope — NATO will be able to lay foundations for afuture all-European security.Preparing for the next round of enlargement of theEuropean Union  an integration which is unique in theworld  is a task for all Europeans. By opening upmembership to Central and East European countries lastyear in Luxembourg  the Union has finally overcome theheritage of a divided continent. We hope the enlargementprocess will maintain the present momentum and that itwill not be hampered by criteria other than the readinessof each candidate country.29Europe has been a contributor to global security.However  it still has to put its own house in order. One ofthe most complicated European security problems ismanaging the consequences of the division of the formerYugoslavia and  in particular  the restoration of a self-sustained peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a settlementof the situation in Kosovo in the former Republic ofYugoslavia. We fully endorse the implementation of theDayton Peace Agreement and believe no better solution isavailable. The military objectives of the Peace Agreementhave practically been met — that is undeniably one of thegreat successes of the implementation of Dayton. Furtherprogress on the civilian side  however  continues to dependon a substantial international presence in Bosnia andHerzegovina  which has to be maintained until the desirableend-state is achieved. That is why the Czech Republiccontinues to participate in the international StabilizationForce (SFOR) spending national resources both on itsmilitary contingent in SFOR and on the reconstruction ofBosnia and Herzegovina.The worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovodue to the ongoing conflict has to be addressed as a matterof urgency. Belgrade must be strongly reminded that it hascrossed the limits of what is tolerable and legitimate. Wewelcome the adoption of Security Council resolution 1199(1998)  adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter just a fewhours ago. In our view  this resolution usefully foreshadowsthe necessary steps for the international community.The Czech Republic has traditionally paid greatattention to the Middle East peace process  and we areconcerned to see that little progress has been made. In ourview  a positive future for this region can only be securedby successfully completing the peace process  and webelieve the process can soon be revitalized.The Czech Republic also supports the endeavour ofthe international community to solve the problem ofCyprus. The current status quo is unacceptable. We hopethat Cyprus will be united as a federation in accordancewith the appropriate United Nations resolutions.We are deeply concerned to see the deterioration ofsecurity and the humanitarian situation in a number ofAfrican countries  including in the region of the GreatLakes  in Sudan and elsewhere. We fully support the effortsof the United Nations and its work with the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) to settle conflicts and stop the humansuffering in Africa. Positive developments we can nowobserve include an improving situation in Sierra Leone which is a source of our optimism on the issue of Africa.We are ready to assist the various processes at work inAfrica  including the dispatching of observers torespective United Nations peacekeeping operations  and inthe development of cooperation.Recent problems in Asia have already beenmentioned. Here we are concerned not only with thecontinuing regional economic and financial crisis and thenuclear tests  but also with enormous natural disasterstaking thousands of lives and causing enormous materialand environmental damage.The scourge of international terrorism must becountered vigorously  and in cooperation among all of us as President Clinton eloquently appealed for at this forumtwo days ago. This task is high on the agenda of many and we believe the United Nations  as the global platform should assert its responsibilities. We endorse all initiativesaimed at cutting terrorists off from any support andresources  isolating them and strictly punishing them.Being a small country  the Czech Republic isnaturally interested in all international efforts aimed atprevention and resolution of armed conflicts. We supportUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and all efforts tomake them more effective. I would like to reiterate thatmy country is committed to contributing further to UnitedNations peacekeeping operations  refining its own forcesto meet the new requirements. Let me point out theincreasing number of attacks against the personnelparticipating in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations and join the call for strict punishment of the perpetratorsof these shameful acts.We support nuclear disarmament and we lookforward to the complete elimination of nuclear arsenals.This is why we regard the nuclear tests carried out inMay 1998 by countries considered non-nuclear-weaponStates as clearly negative steps. Universal compliancewith the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) is a logical step on the way towardsnuclear disarmament  as is speedy enactment of theComprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). On the otherhand  the progress made in the Geneva Conference onDisarmament towards a fissile material cut-off treaty isencouraging.The Czech Republic appreciates the work of theOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inthe area of chemical disarmament. We are prepared tocontinue contributing to the work of the Organization andto strictly implement all its commitments arising out of30the respective Convention. At the same time  we support allefforts meant to speed up the negotiation of the verificationprotocol text  which is to strengthen the BiologicalWeapons Convention (BWC); we regard the protocol as animportant mechanism controlling implementation of theConvention.The signing of the Ottawa Convention on the completeban on anti-personnel landmines by about 100 MemberStates  including the Czech Republic  has been a greatsuccess. Now early entry into force has been ensured.Implementation  however  will be an even bigger task forall. While preparing for the ratification of the OttawaConvention  we have a clear view of its domesticimplementation.It is the Security Council that continues to have thedecisive word in questions of peace and security. TheCzech Republic considers itself among the reform-mindedcountries  supporting the Council?s enlargement  in bothcategories of membership  which guarantees equitablegeographic representation. To be more specific  we continuesupporting the aspirations of the Federal Republic ofGermany and Japan in this respect.It is rather disappointing that after five years of theWorking Group?s dealing with this issue concrete resultshave not been achieved. On the contrary  it seems thatMember States are even further apart on the issue.Unfortunately  the same applies to the question ofimproving and simplifying the methods of the Council?swork  on which consensus seemed to be near a year ago.It is our view that the Working Group should continueits work with the aim of achieving general agreement  tothe extent possible  until the end of the millennium. Wehope that talks will eventually produce concrete results thatcould be put on the agenda of the fifty-fifth session of theGeneral Assembly within the Millennium Assemblyconcept.The new Government of the Czech Republic attachesgreat importance to the issue of human rights. ThisDecember we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  adocument substantially influencing the internationalcommunity and international relations.The record of these 50 years is no doubt impressive but there is still a long way to go to achieve the desireduniversal acceptance and indivisibility of human rights. Thissad situation can be illustrated by the fact that there are stillcountries governed by totalitarian regimes where peopleare punished for such absurd “crimes” as distributing theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights or for refusing toexplain where they obtained such a “subversivedocument”. However  it has to be admitted that economicsanctions or embargoes do not seem to be effective meansof persuading a country to promote human rights.The successful conclusion of the DiplomaticConference in Rome last July  which resulted in theshaping of the International Criminal Court  fills us withhope. The adoption of the Court?s Statute is a clearbreakthrough in the area of humanitarian law and humanrights protection. We are aware that this is only an initialstage of the long process leading to a functioning Court but the step taken in Rome was crucial. I would like toexpress our gratitude to the Government of Italy for itssubstantial contribution to the success of the Conference.Cooperation in the social  economic andhumanitarian areas should undoubtedly be  in addition tobuilding peace and security  major preoccupations of theUnited Nations. Over the last few years there have beenstrong discussions on the Economic and Social Counciland its function. The Czech Republic was activelyinvolved during its Council presidency in 1997. Thechallenge for the Council  stemming from globalization ofeconomic and other links  was enormous. On the otherhand  the actual possibilities of this body to tacklesubstantial issues were rather limited. But now we arepleased to see it undergoing some promising changes.The Czech Republic appreciates the attention paid bythe United Nations to the critical issue of globalizationand its impact on economic and social development in thedifferent countries of the world. For many  like mycountry  whose economies are undergoing a fundamentaltransformation  the consequences of globalization aredoubly difficult to handle. That is why we would like theUnited Nations to have a clear agenda on globalization and we are encouraged by the lead provided by theSecretary-General.The new Government of the Czech Republic haspromised in its Programme Statement wide support forthe strengthening of United Nations authority. We havewelcomed the results so far achieved in implementing theSecretary-General?s plan for United Nations reform. Muchof the reform package  however  remains unresolved  anda number of proposals have not left the negotiating table.The Czech Republic supports speedy approval andimplementation of the remaining reform proposals.31However  even the best blueprints do not count for muchwithout money to implement them. Like others  I want tostress that the financial situation of the Organization isalarming  and I would like to underline that discipline withregard to contributing is a must for all.We look with expectations to the proposed MillenniumAssembly to be held in the year 2000  inspired  amongothers  by Czech President Václav Havel. The MillenniumSummit held within its framework could then focus on thechallenges the United Nations will be facing in the nextmillennium and identify major trends and objectives offuture United Nations activities. In addition  an importantrole could be played by a related non-governmental“Millennium Forum”. The Czech Republic?s specialcontribution to such a debate can be “FORUM 2000”  aconference taking place in Prague next month aimed athighlighting global problems that humankind faces at thethreshold of the twenty-first century.In conclusion  allow me to express my sincere beliefin the eventual success of the United Nations reformprocess. I think we can all agree that from this process theUnited Nations  a truly remarkable Organization  willemerge consolidated  strengthened and more capable thanever of solving the problems of the contemporary world —an Organization open to all who are willing to contribute tothe fulfilment of this important task."

I wish you goodfortune and all of us a successful session.I should also like to thank Ambassador Udovenko forthe dedicated way he conducted the business of the fifty-second session. He advanced the reform process at theUnited Nations and kept it on the agenda. We can and mustfollow up these efforts.This session of the General Assembly has a specialsignificance for my country. It was 25 years ago  almost tothe day  on 19 September 1973  that Walter Scheel becamethe first Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic ofGermany to address the United Nations. When he describedour perception of the United Nations  he said that it meantmore than the mere security of States  more than the mereregulation of their diplomatic relations. He said that whatit is all about is the beginning and the objective of anyrational policy â€” people.That description of our role in the United Nationsremains valid. United Germany too feels committed to aworld free from fear and want  protected by the rule of law a world in which every individual has his opportunity andwhich preserves the integrity of Creation for futuregenerations. It is the vision enshrined in the InternationalBill of Human Rights.We have come a lot closer to that vision over the past25 years. The division of Germany  Europe and the worldhas been healed. The world is developing ever more intothe â€œone worldâ€ on the foundations of democracy andhuman rights. But it is also becoming increasingly clear thatthe human race has never been so bound up together in itscommon destiny  united by common challenges  as it istoday.The crises in Russia and Asia have shaken the worldeconomy. The global scourges of drugs  organized crimeand terrorism spread their tentacles around the globe. Theyear 1998 is the year of climate disasters. Two thirds ofBangladesh is under water and the Yangtze floods inChina have claimed thousands of lives.No State  whether super-Power or small island State can master these global challenges alone. And no one canescape them  least of all the suffering people: thehomeless in Bangladesh  the drug addict in Europe  thevictim of civil war in Africa.We can shape our future only through joint efforts.We therefore need global action and global managementfor the global challenges of the twenty-first century; nottomorrow or the day after  but today.This is a test not only for Governments but also forthe other global players: the non-governmentalorganizations and the multinational corporations. Neverwere the non-governmental organizations so important asthey are today. Without them the Ottawa Conventionbanning landmines could not have been signed inDecember 1997. And  let us not forget  51 of the worldâshundred largest economic entities are now companies  andonly 49 of them States. All this shows that the time hascome for new alliances for peace  freedom and prosperitythroughout the world.The age of globalization is the age of the UnitedNations. Only here do all nations of the world cometogether. Only here can we find joint solutions to theglobal challenges of today and tomorrow. This is why weGermans want to help get the United Nations in shape forthe twenty-first century. We are facing up to thisresponsibility â€” as the second largest export nation andthe third largest economy in the world  and as the countrywith the largest population in the European Union.We owe Secretary-General Kofi Annan our gratitudeand support for his reform proposals. Now it is up to theMember States. The Security Council still mirrors theworld as it was at the end of the Second World War  butnot the enhanced status of Asia  Africa and Latin Americawith the Caribbean.The same is true of the greater weight of Japan andunited Germany. I wish to thank all Member States thatadvocate a permanent seat for Germany on the SecurityCouncil. Security Council reform cannot be delayed anylonger; otherwise  the momentum will be lost and thatwould be bad indeed.16Since the ending of the cold war the United Nationshas had more burdens to shoulder than ever. It thereforeneeds effective institutions  and for this reason it has a rightto expect members to pay their dues on time. All  andespecially the big members  must help according to theirability to ensure that the world Organization can accomplishits tasks. Germany  the third largest contributor  willcontinue to meet its obligations.We know from recent experience that we should notadd to but rather ease the burden of the United Nations.This is a task especially for regional organizations like theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). Ifthey succeed in settling conflicts locally  the SecurityCouncil will not need to deal with them. I think that wouldbe very well-advised  because it would free capacities forall of us.New avenues of joint action are therefore called for.To pretend globalization is not happening would be absurd.Only those who face up to the challenge can exploit theopportunities and cushion the risks.The impact of the crises in Russia and Asia shows thatthe world economy needs a reliable framework. That is notto say we need a global financial authority or fixedexchange rates  least of all a new wave of protectionism.But we do need better early-warning mechanisms  moretransparency and more efficient banking systems  especiallyin the newly emerging economies.This is not a task for Governments alone. What isneeded now is a global public-private partnership betweenGovernments  international financial organizations andcorporations. We therefore support the American initiativefor a dialogue between the G-8 and the newly emergingeconomies on a new international financial architecture. TheInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bankshould not always have to serve as the stopgap when theopportunity for structural reforms has been missed.Managing globalization also means weaving a networkof partnerships between the big regional groupings and thebig countries. The regional groupings are the componentsof a new global order under the roof of the United Nations.The European Unionâs partnerships with regionalorganizations like the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN)  the Southern Common Market(MERCOSUR) and the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) prove we are on the right course: Wewant an open  not a confrontational  kind of regionalism.I am confident that the European Union will be ananchor of stability in the twenty-first century. Byintroducing a single currency on 1 January 1999  it isfocusing its energies. Its global role will increase. It isabout to begin further negotiations on accession withassociated partners. What Willy Brandt said aboutGermany in 1989 applies today to the whole of Europe:â€œWhat belongs together is now growing togetherâ€.The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) toois also gradually opening its doors to the newdemocracies. In the year of its fiftieth anniversary it willadmit Poland  Hungary and the Czech Republic. Togetherwith Russia  Ukraine and the other Commonwealth ofIndependent States members  we are developing acomprehensive security partnership.True  the Russians are having a rough time atpresent  but the world needs a democratic and stableRussia  a Russia which will play the role commensuratewith its size  its status and its potential. Russia faces aHerculean task of consolidating the economy andmaintaining social stability. All those responsible mustface up to the challenge: the President  the Government the parties and business. Of course  the regions too arecalled upon.I know from my talks with Prime Minister Primakovlast week in Moscow that Russia intends neither tochange course nor to go into reverse. The crisis in Russiaaffects us all. We will not abandon Russia. It can counton us.The Kosovo conflict remains a thorn in Europeâsside. A humanitarian disaster in the true sense of theword is looming. The situation of the refugees  more than250 000 of them  is desperate. International organizations the European Union  the United States and Russia arecoordinating their efforts to enable those who have beendriven out to return to their villages.Time is getting short; winter is just around thecorner. Most of the responsibility for this drama lies withBelgrade  with President Milosevic. He must realize thatthe international community will react with military forceif necessary. We still seek a political solution forKosovo â€” self-administration within the YugoslavFederation. However  this cannot be achieved withoutBelgrade and Pristina. So the weapons must now besilenced. We condemn the use of force by the Yugoslavsecurity forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. Therecent reports we have received from Kosovo are very17disappointing  troubling and worrisome. I hope they are nottrue.NATO is prepared to provide the backing for apolitical solution. Yugoslavia and Kosovo are a part ofEurope. Their future can only be a European one. Thehistory of Europe in this century shows that we canovercome hatred and mistrust. But we have to have thewillingness to do so.In Bosnia  too  we have seen animosity slowly beingreplaced by trust and cooperation. Recently I paid mytwelfth visit to Sarajevo. That tormented city is slowlybeginning to blossom again  and the countryâsreconstruction is progressing.Nonetheless  the peace process must continue to bebuttressed by NATO and the Stabilization Force (SFOR) for the process is not self-sustaining. Regardless of theresult of the elections  the international community will nottolerate any reversal of the implementation of the peaceagreement. Furthermore  genuine peace will not return untilthe presumed war criminals and enemies of peace â€”Mr. Karadzic and his lot â€” have been brought to trial inThe Hague.Only when those guilty of crimes against humanity torturers and terrorists all over the world  have beenbrought to justice will we all be able to sleep peacefully.Thus  the establishment of the International CriminalCourt on 17 July as a major step towards a world order inwhich the force of law  not the law of force  prevails.Germany was the driving force. I appeal to all countries tosign and ratify the Courtâs Statute.No one stands more at the mercy of those who wieldpower than refugees. At present more than 20 millionpeople worldwide are in flight: despairing elderly people women  children; people who are sick  homeless anddestitute and have absolutely no idea what is going tohappen to them.Over the last several years I have been to manyrefugee camps  in Albania  Africa and the Middle East.Every refugeeâs case is a story of immeasurable humansuffering.Germany is now the country with the second largestnumber of refugees. From Kosovo alone  150 000 refugeeshave found refuge in Germany.The suffering of the refugees is a humanitarian andpolitical challenge to the international community as awhole. What is now needed  therefore  is a global refugeepolicy. The United Nations  too  has to do somethingabout it.Specifically  this means  first  a more equitabledistribution of the refugees  as I recommended here in theGeneral Assembly in 1993. We cannot leave the poorestcountries to their own devices in trying to cope with therefugee problem.Secondly  greater efforts will have to be made toremove the causes of flight and expulsion.Secretary-General Kofi Annan has declared thetwenty-first century a century of prevention  and withgood reason. To wait until a situation gets so bad thatpeople have to take flight is to make oneself partlyresponsible. Trouble must therefore be nipped in the bud.This is the task of preventive diplomacy  of human rightsobservers and peacekeeping forces.Striking at the root of mass flight and migration alsomeans eliminating the economic  ecological and socialcauses. The gap between rich and poor grows wider. Thewealthiest 20 per cent of the world population consume86 per cent of all goods  the poorest 20 per cent only 1.3per cent.This equity gap must be closed. Every individual hasa right to live in dignity  free from hunger and want.All nations must be given a fair chance in globalcompetition  the poorest ones in particular. Hence  it is upto the rich countries to help the poor make the most oftheir opportunities for development.Our aim is a social world market economy. This iswhy in 1997 Germany spent 10.25 billion deutsche markson bilateral and multilateral assistance measures â€” aninvestment in peace and stability.Africa shows what can be achieved when theinternational community and the countries concerned pulltogether. Today  democratic elections are held in morethan half of the African countries. In 20 African countrieseconomic growth is between 4 and 6 per cent  and in 11it is higher still.We want the Africans to know that we will notabandon that vast continent and its 800 million people despite the heavy burdens it still has to bear.18Poverty and refugee problems are also exacerbatingthe situation in the Middle East. The people in Israel and inthe Palestinian territories long for peace more than anythingelse on earth. The peace process requires fresh impetus.The Israelis and Palestinians must move towards eachother again and rediscover the lost mutual trust.We Europeans will continue to support this processwith our American friends. We back Israelâs legitimateclaim to security for its State and citizens.The Palestinians have recognized that claim; nowwords must be followed by deeds. They must see to it thatterrorism has no chance.But Israel  too  must show compromise as regards afurther partial withdrawal. Neither side should put any newobstacles in the way of a deal â€” and that includes allowingnew settlements in the occupied territories.Particularly in the Middle East  we have time andagain seen that terrorism leads to a dead end  destructionand suffering. We must pit all our strength against thecynics who advocate violence  the fanatics and ideologues;the dead of Omagh  Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam serve as awarning. Those who plant bombs and murder people mustbe brought to justice.Drying up the sources of terrorism â€” poverty  ethnicconflict and fundamentalism â€” is our commonresponsibility. But to fight terrorism is not to fight Islam.Islam is one of the great world religions. Nothing could befurther from the truth than the clichÃ© that Islam issynonymous with fundamentalism and violations of humanrights.We want a dialogue of cultures and religions especially with Islam. There exists an ethic of humanitythat unites us all. This ethic is based on the inalienabledignity of every individual  as expressed in the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights and the human rightscovenants of the United Nations. These are the benchmarksfor our joint action in the twenty-first century.Violations of human rights are no longer an internalmatter of States. They concern us all. Any group which like the regime in Kabul  denies women their basic humanrights places itself outside the international community ofcommon values.The world of tomorrow will be judged by how wetreat our children today. They are our most valuable asset.Yet the rights of many children are still being trampledunderfoot. Millions of children have no chance to live alife in dignity. Millions of children are forced to work.Particularly appalling is the fact that every yearsome two million children all over the world are sexuallyabused. Only through joint action can we stop childprostitution  traffic in children and child pornography including that proliferated via the Internet. I thereforepropose that the United Nations set up a contact point tocoordinate worldwide efforts to eradicate sexual abuse ofchildren. The optional protocol to the Convention on theRights of the Child designed to afford better protectionagainst sexual exploitation should be quickly adopted andquickly put into effect.Children are small people who need big rights.Protection for children during armed conflicts must beimproved  including by outlawing their use as soldiers.We all hoped that with the ending of the East-Westconfrontation the danger of a nuclear conflagration wouldbe gone forever. This has proved to be an illusion. Thethreat of proliferation of means of mass destructionhovers over the human race. We can safeguard worldpeace in the twenty-first century only if we keep suchterrible weapons under control.In Geneva  India and Pakistan have agreed tonegotiations on a cut-off. Thatâs a good sign  but notnearly enough. It must be followed by their accession tothe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. And allnations should now sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty. This also applies to the conventions banningchemical and biological weapons. The adoption of averification protocol to the Biological WeaponsConvention is now urgent.Next March the Ottawa Convention imposing aworldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines enters intoforce â€” a great success. Only if all countries now signthe Convention will these diabolical devices soon bewiped from the face of the earth. It is our common taskto get rid of the 100 million mines still remaining  usingstate-of-the-art technology.We must also radically rethink our attitude to nature.The victims of the floods in China and Bangladesh are awarning. We must swing the wheel round now. This weowe to our children and grandchildren. We can save ourblue planet and its ecosystem together or not at all.19Take the world climate. The Kyoto Protocol launcheda global effort to protect it. That was a big step forward.But time is getting short. We have just had the warmesthalf year this century. At the fourth session of theConference of the Parties to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change  scheduled for Buenos Airesin November  we shall have to agree on the instrumentswith which to achieve the objectives of Kyoto.Take water. Water is irreplaceable. Water is moreimportant than oil. Yet in more than 80 countries it is inshort supply. Two billion people have insufficient access ornone at all to clean drinking water. Finding joint solutionsfor the peaceful use and conservation of water  the sourceof life  is one of the great tasks of the twenty-first century.The pursuit of this scarce commodity must not be allowedto spark fresh conflicts.Germany intends to remain in the vanguard of theinternational campaign to protect the environment. I amgratified to note that our commitment has beenacknowledged by the appointment of Klaus TÃ¶pfer asExecutive Director of the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme.But we are not going to rest on our laurels. A fewdays ago I opened an international conference in Potsdamon early-warning mechanisms for natural disasters. Theconference has shown that progress can be achieved if wewant it. Specifically  it is now a question of establishingeffective global early-warning systems for environmentalcrises and natural disasters  and developing emergencymanagement arrangements for the coordination ofinternational relief measures. We must now get down tothis task  and the United Nations is the right place to do so.Four hundred and sixty three days from now thetwentieth century comes to an end â€” a century ofunprecedented violence and destruction. The comingcentury must be a century with a humane countenance.What a wonderful vision. But talking about it is notenough. Only if we act together will we survive together.The United Nations is indispensable to this task.Strengthening it to secure a peaceful and more equitableworld â€” that is our responsibility. This we owe to cominggenerations. My country will devote every possible effortto this task."
"45",1897,"DJI",53,1998,"Ibring to you  Sir  and to all the representatives to thisGeneral Assembly the warm greetings of the people ofDjibouti. I extend to Mr. Opertti my sincerecongratulations on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. As the worldgrows smaller and the problems confronting us grow evermore challenging  the deliberations of humanity?s forum the General Assembly  assume a critical urgency. Hiscompetence and broad experience will undoubtedly guideus very ably in the coming year.We are also most grateful to his predecessor  theformer Foreign Minister of Ukraine  for bringing to beara degree of focus and productivity that was exemplary.Through his exceptional grasp of the issues before theGeneral Assembly  he was able to lead us to satisfactoryresults.Our indefatigable Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  continues to earn our deepest appreciation for themanner in which he has managed the activities of theOrganization  especially for the way in which the UnitedNations has risen in the eyes of the general public.Demands on the United Nations have increased. Ever-changing economic  environmental  social and politicalproblems have added to these demands. Core contributionsto the funds and programmes continue to decline  however and the United Nations faces unpredictable resource flowsdue to unpaid assessments. Recognizing that a radicaltransformation of the United Nations would cause politicaltensions  the Secretary-General wisely formulated a seriesof realistic reforms to rationalize operations  reduce costsand refocus on certain critical areas demanding UnitedNations attention  such as the mitigation of poverty sustainable development and strengthening management andcoordination  both at Headquarters and in field-levelactivities.We support the Secretary-General?s relentless effortsto communicate directly with and engage the people of theworld  exploring critical issues and exchanging views withthem  and explaining the role  capacities and constraints ofthe United Nations system. His work has given the UnitedNations a reality and a new face vital to its mission.In early August  a corner of our world  eastern Africa was profoundly shocked  baffled and aggrieved by the well-coordinated simultaneous bombings of United Statesembassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Over 260 peoplelost their lives and thousands of innocent people wereinjured in those attacks.These brazen acts of aggression wroughtunprecedented carnage and extensive destruction anddamage to property. I recently visited Nairobi. What I sawresembled a war zone. I unreservedly condemn thissenseless act of terrorism. Once again  I wish to express ourheartfelt condolences to all the families who lost their lovedones in this tragedy and pray for the speedy recovery of theinjured.May I also express our concern at the United Statesaction against the Sudan. There are growing doubts aboutthe justification for the raid that devastated the El Shifapharmaceutical plant  which produced desperately neededmedicines and drugs. Visiting there recently  I was struckby the extent of the damage. All that is left of the plant isa mountain of rubble. The onus lies now on the UnitedStates to produce fuller evidence to support its claim. Wealso urge the United Nations to undertake an independentinvestigation to determine whether this factory was indeedmaking chemical weapons  as alleged.It seems essential to remind ourselves that the annualsession of the General Assembly has become the soleoccasion for virtually all mankind  collectively  toappraise the human condition. Additionally  drawn as weare by the hypnotic spell of the approaching millennium the need to assess our past successes  achievements andfailures and to develop priorities and strategies for thefuture has assumed a sense of urgency.A little over 50 years ago  the world embarked withgreat vision  enthusiasm and optimism upon a high-minded journey to end the scourge of war  eliminatepoverty and create a world of freedom and justice for all.Undoubtedly  much has been accomplished and the worldis a far better place to live in  despite the fact that manydreams remain unfulfilled and many commitmentsunimplemented.This decade  in particular  has witnessed tendenciestowards the fragmentation of societies  the spread of civilstrife and conflict and a plunge further into the povertytrap. In general  we recognize that respect for humanrights has improved and that many countries haveembraced democracy and good governance  and wewelcome that.Unfortunately  human rights violations continue  andthere is a lingering concern about the capacity  resourcesand mandates of the United Nations for timelyintervention in cases of egregious violations of humanrights. We have had the bad experience of regrettablevacillation and indifference in the face of appalling crimescommitted in Bosnia and Rwanda  and now in Kosovo.As the United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights has correctly stated  efforts to prevent the mostabominable violence should focus not only on resolvingethnic and political disputes  but also on the social issuesof chronic underdevelopment  grinding poverty  massunemployment  widespread illiteracy and systematicinequalities of income or opportunities.We therefore welcome the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court  which replaces once and forall the ad hoc proceedings. It fills in the gap ininternational law exposed by the famous Nuremberg trialsof Nazi war criminals: the need to install a permanentinternational institution able to investigate war crimes genocide and crimes against humanity.Much of the technological advancement of thetwentieth century has created a host of other problems.Man?s mastery over nature for his own benefit has2become a potential nightmare of environmental disasters one which we seemingly lack the will to contain or correct.Will we continue to have land to farm  clean water to drinkand healthy air to breath? Will our cities decay into piles ofhumans for whom day to day survival becomes thecrowning achievement of their lives?Overpopulation  abject poverty  crime  drugs and theconsequences they bring may soon threaten the foundationsof social cohesion. To a great extent  these forces aretransnational  extending beyond the capacity and control ofindividual States. They are global in nature and poseserious challenges to society and its leadership. We mustact collectively in marshalling the resources necessary tomitigate the harmful effects of modernization andglobalization.Unquestionably  the founding of the United Nationswas one of the outstanding achievements of this century.After 50 years  we can take pride in the continuingrelevance of this institution. Naturally  given the breadthand complexity of issues facing the United Nations andmankind  there will always be differences of views on theevolving role of the United Nations. However  the basicmission of the United Nations has not changed one iota:collective international action for maintenance ofinternational peace and security and promotion of economicand social development for all.While the Charter remains relevant  the world of 1945is no longer with us. The United Nations of today mustembrace the realities of the new millennium. Anachronisticstructures and outmoded thinking cannot coexist withcurrent needs and perceptions. The phenomenal growth inthe membership of the United Nations leads us to hope fora more democratic  transparent and representativeOrganization. This is the case in particular with regard tothe Security Council  which must reconcile itself toundergoing a thorough transformation in both its structureand its functions in order to reflect a more equitablegeographical representation of developing and developedcountries.The sudden outbreak of hostilities between ourneighbours  Ethiopia and Eritrea  has greatly dismayed us.As in the case of Somalia  Djibouti has attempted toreconcile the different points of view in various ways although there are few real signs of hope for a way out ofthe stalemate. Beyond the tragic loss of lives  displacementof people and destruction of property and facilities  thepsychological wounds inflicted by the tensions andhostilities that are dividing these countries suggest that itwill be several difficult years before the Horn of Africabecomes once again a region of peace and trust. Bothleaders understand my frustration — indeed  myexasperation — at this wasteful  unnecessary andseemingly endless conflict. We are confronted by seriousregional problems and must revive economies that havebeen dormant for a long time. We need a new vision  newperspectives and a far-sighted approach to deal withbilateral differences.I urge my friends  the leaders of Ethiopia andEritrea  to give peace a chance. Let us end the hostilepropaganda and provocative rhetoric and replace it witha genuine desire to engage constructively in finding asolution to this problem. It would be a tragedy if therelentless shuttling between Addis Ababa and Asmara byleaders and senior officials of many Governments including heads of regional organizations  who have alldemonstrated immense goodwill and perseverance andexpended time  energy and boundless effort in trying toresolve the conflict  were to be taken by some to belargely symbolic. We believe they are more than that. Theseries of attempts made by a great many mediators andfacilitators demonstrates the seriousness of this matter.The many views  opinions  decisions and resolutionsrelating to this conflict  even if not wholly acceptable toone or both parties  nevertheless contain significantelements that can form the basis of a settlement. It isincumbent upon both leaders to go beyond the immediateunfortunate problem and to look forward resolutely to abetter and promising future of benefit to all. In the wordsof the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations  Icall upon the leaders of those countries“to practise tolerance and live together in peace withone another as good neighbours”.There is no doubt that the speed of globalization andthe expansion and integration of the internationaleconomy have brought immense benefits to manycountries and positive changes in the living condition ofmany people. However  several countries and theirpopulations  particularly in the developing world  arefacing marginalization and hopelessness because they areunable to adapt to the rapid pace of integration. The leastdeveloped countries in particular require special attentionso that they do not slip further into the abyss of povertyand disintegration.The World Economic Survey 1997 shows that Africawill have to demonstrate still higher and more sustainedrates of growth in order to alleviate widespread poverty3and reduce high unemployment. Improved and sustainedmacroeconomic stability and economic reforms have playedimportant roles in Africa?s recent economic upturn although the sacrifices have been great.But Africa must now grapple with the erroneousperception by developed countries that private investmentflows can be a substitute for development assistance  whichin fact largely bypasses the continent: only 5 per cent ofsuch assistance goes to Africa as a whole  and only 1 percent to sub-Saharan Africa. Add this to the crippling debtservicing costs and it becomes clear that Africa  and inparticular the least developed of its countries  is in aprecarious financial position. The danger of prolonged  orindefinite  marginalization is a real one.As the continent continues to be mired in a series ofcrises  the much vaunted policy of finding African solutionsto African problems  which was among the precursors ofWestern disengagement  seems to be predicated on anumber of premises that are tenuous at best. The fact is thatAfrica cannot succeed alone; it needs serious  resolutecommitment to Africa?s economic recovery on the part ofthe industrial countries  along with a determination toprevent and resolve conflicts. It is important to note thatAfrican countries have played an important role in theefforts to maintain and restore peace in Liberia and inSierra Leone. That is a positive development that we cannotfail to welcome. But we are saddened by the resurgence ofhostilities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Wewarn all involved in the current crisis that pursuingindividual military agendas in the Congo is not in theinterest of the long-term stability of the region or of Africaas a whole. The territorial integrity of that country must berespected  and no country in the region or in any otherregion of Africa should try to place any of its neighboursunder its thumb.Since 1991  at the time of Somalia?s implosion Djibouti  both independently and through theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)  hastirelessly sought to restore peace and security to thatcountry. In 1991  we organized the first two nationalreconciliation conferences; then the United Nations beganits extensive operations. Subsequently  Ethiopia  with amandate from IGAD and the Organization of African Unity(OAU)  organized a series of meetings that led to theSodere agreement. Other countries  the League of ArabStates  various Arab States and other organizations havealso made serious reconciliation efforts during this period.Every year  new conferences were held and new agreementssigned  none of which were implemented. This shows thatthe faction leaders had learned the technique of makingpeople believe in a reconciliation that would last about aslong as their return flights home.Since the United Nations departure anddisengagement from Somalia in the mid-1990s  theinternational community has come to remember only a“failed operation” and a “failed State”. But that devastatedcountry needs the United Nations to become engagedonce again. Somalia deserves greater interest and attentionthan it now gets. This is not solely a regional or even anAfrican or Arab problem; Somalia was and continues tobe an international disaster. Its neighbours have madeenough concessions  and they stand to sacrifice and riskeven more. It is therefore fair to say that it is not easy ortolerable to continue living in a no-peace-no-war situation.Imagine having to life beside a neighbour without laws without a government  without a central authority.After seven years of bickering  the faction leadershave nothing new to offer. Give the people of Somalia with the support of the international community  a chanceto elect leaders of their choice  by stages  both regionallyand nationally — without threats and without blackmail.It is not impossible that the evolving new approach ofsetting up regional administrations or “mini-states” couldenhance security and stability and shape the futurepolitical structure of Somalia  so long as they do notcompromise the country?s unity.We are deeply saddened by the lack of progressunder the peace agreements in the Arab-Israeli conflict.Israel is continuing to seize Palestinian property; engagingin relentless settlement activities in the West Bank;imposing intransigent rule over East Jerusalem; andillegally and unilaterally extending the boundaries of themunicipality of Jerusalem.Israel?s arbitrary and coercive measures  whichinclude the suspension of the Palestinians? rights to enter work  trade  reside  remain  build or travel in the country have created intolerable uncertainties and a difficultsituation. We demand that Israel immediately withdraw itstroops  put a stop to settlement and construction in thesettlements  and desist from taking unilateral decisionsthat undermine the peace efforts  as called for by the Oslopeace accords.We are one with the legitimate aspirations of thePalestinian people to establish an independent State andto live side by side with Israel in peace and within secureborders. Above all  we hope that Israel will heed the call4by the international community to establish comprehensivepeace in the Middle East on the basis of Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978).The relentless fratricidal war in Afghanistan shows nosign of abating  despite intense and continuing internationalefforts. The people of Afghanistan have suffered immenselyand are on the verge of losing all hope of any politicalsolution to this crisis. In the last two years there has beenan increase in violence  intolerance  and the abuse ofhuman rights  in particular against women. We hope thatthe risk of tensions escalating as a result of the murder ofIranian diplomats will be defused through the ongoinginitiatives of the Secretary-General.The international community has often turned tosanctions in order to combat violations of international lawor to punish uncontrolled criminal behaviour. In practice however  the application of sanctions is often too generaland broad  serving particular political interests. Real targetsor target groups are not affected  and it is the innocentpopulation at large that suffers as a result of such blindembargoes. Once sanctions become personalized or are usedto serve as weapons to serve and protect powerful interests they cease to have time limits or clear indications as towhen their requirements have been met. Their originalpurpose is lost and the sanctions assume a life of their own.The end result is a climate of frustration and non-compliance with a resultant considerable squandering ofcredibility. Without a sense of limits  purpose and fairness the exercise then becomes futile and counter-productive.Behind the broad global problems facing our planetEarth  some of which I have mentioned briefly  lie specificareas and countries which merit particular attention. Forexample  there is universal concern about the economic andfinancial crisis assailing Asia and its implications for therest of the world. It is difficult to comprehend that theAsian miracle we had all come to marvel at should collapseso abruptly  with grave consequences for Governments businessmen and peoples. Many of the countries involvedrisk falling into severe recession. Whatever the explanationfor this crisis  this experience proves that there are realperils in the free flow of international capital. The dangeris incalculable  forcing serious revision of some of ourlong-term development plans.It is also disturbing to see so many of the resources ofthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) going towardsrescuing large international banks and financial institutionsthat recklessly and of their own volition placed their fundsin sectors where restraint and control were needed. Now wemust all wonder who will be the next to suffer a flight ofcapital and who will help to bail them out. There isundoubtedly a strong case for creating a better mechanismto regulate international standards for financialmanagement and capital flows.The task of engendering a national sense of identityand cohesion and shared values against a backdrop ofturbulence and instability is one of the core challenges ofnation-building. In Djibouti  we have had our ups anddowns. We continue to face daunting economicdifficulties  aggravated by the presence of a great numberof refugees  which has overwhelmed our limited meansand severely strained our social services.I am proud to say that Djibouti  despite theseobstacles  has established itself as a nation  a responsiblemember of the international community. Since gainingindependence over 20 years ago  we have effected aseries of changes aimed at the attainment of betterstandards of living and have undertaken to found a cultureof democracy and tolerance. The process of acceleratedpolitical and economic change continues  however fragileit may be.I believe in the concept that there should beopponents but not enemies. That is why tolerance compassion and forbearance have guided my actions asleader of my country. We have pursued a policy ofregional and ethnic inclusion  and have long recognizedthe concept of diversity in unity.Djibouti?s approach to regional affairs has alwaysbeen based on mutual respect  moderation andcooperation. We believe that the countries of the Horn ofAfrica must unite to confront the problems of poverty conflicts and underdevelopment within the framework ofthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development whoserevitalization is crucial.At the international level  we credibly contributed tothe maintenance of peace and security during ourmembership in the Security Council in 1993 and 1994. Asan extension of this  we have participated in internationalpeacekeeping missions to bring peace and stability tocountries in the throes of conflict.In the context of the current global financial turmoil one thing is certain: yesterday?s international institutionscannot cope with today?s intensity  magnitude andrapidity  which demand greater openness andtransparency. Djibouti therefore joins in the overwhelming5call for a comprehensive overhaul of the InternationalMonetary Fund and the World Bank so that they canadequately respond to the financial calamity we areexperiencing. They must also be fully equipped to mount adetermined attack on poverty  growing hopelessness andunderdevelopment. I pray that the new millennium willbring us more stability  understanding and harmony amongnations  and among peoples within nations."
"46",1918,"DMA",53,1998,"It is my distinct honour andprivilege to address this body once again. In doing so  mayI take the opportunity to offer  on behalf of theCommonwealth of Dominica  sincere congratulations toyou  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. My thanks arealso extended to Ambassador Udovenko  who so ablyguided the fifty-second session.Our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  has beenindefatigable in his efforts to bring about peace in variouscountries and regions. To him we express our thanks andcongratulations. Last year  I extended an invitation to himto visit the Caribbean. He has not yet done so. Theinvitation remains open.The Caribbean region continues to demonstrate itscommitment to the democratic process. Since we last metin this forum the people of several of our States  withinthe provisions of the existing rules  freely expressed theirwill as to who should lead them into the new millennium.Our assertion that democracy is alive and well is nota reflection that all is well in the region. The Charter ofthis Organization imposes an obligation on all itsMembers to work for the peace  security and economicand social development of all peoples of the world. Aswe seek to discharge that obligation  it behoves us to beconstantly cognizant of those factors and events whichwould militate against our success. Some of these arenatural and unavoidable; others are man-made andregrettable.The Caribbean was only a few days ago severelyimpacted upon by one such natural disaster  HurricaneGeorges. The damage inflicted was extensive  particularlyin St. Kitts and Nevis  Antigua and Barbuda  Haiti and theDominican Republic. On their behalf  I urge this body togenerously respond to their expressed need for assistance inthe reconstruction work. But the Charter obligations of theUnited Nations call for more than an ad hoc responsearrangement. We must first recognize the acutevulnerability of small States to natural disasters such ashurricanes  floods  volcanoes  earthquakes and so on  andtheir intrinsic limitations in mitigating and responding tothem.What is being proposed  therefore  is the establishmentof a disaster reconstruction fund under the auspices of theUnited Nations  the resources of which would be availablefor quick and effective response to the needs of smallStates post disaster. And there is still more that must bedone. Global warming and the greenhouse effect must behalted.There are on the agenda of this fifty-third session ofthe General Assembly many matters of profoundimportance to the Commonwealth of Dominica and theCaribbean Community as a whole. These includemacroeconomic policy questions on trade and development;the revitalization of the economic growth and developmentof developing countries; the United Nations Decade for theEradication of Poverty; the protection of the global climatefor present and future generations of mankind; andcooperation between the United Nations and the CaribbeanCommunity.That cooperation is nowhere more necessary than inour fight to maintain the integrity of the market for ourbananas. Our fight is against some very powerful membersof this very United Nations  which seem determined toderail our democracy  upset our efforts to eradicate povertyand undermine the peace and security of our region.The people of the Commonwealth of Dominica andthe people of the Caribbean Community look to the UnitedNations to intervene on their behalf. The people of theCommonwealth of Dominica and the Caribbean Communityare firm in their conviction that globalization and tradeliberalization cannot be allowed to result in themarginalization and economic disintegration of smalldeveloping States.We seek a level playing field on which our people canengage meaningfully in trade and development  rather thanbe for ever subjected to the aid-and-dependency syndrome.Our expressed desire to hold on to our banana industry which has served us well  in no way reflects anymisunderstanding of the reality of the current trade andeconomic environment.We in the Commonwealth of Dominica are activelyengaged in the diversification of our economy  involvingthe agricultural  tourism and service sectors. We havemade progress towards improving air access to ourcountry and are providing increased opportunities for ourchildren to receive secondary and tertiary education.We consider the recent naming of one of ournational parks  Morne Trois Pitons  as a World Heritagesite to be a resounding statement of our commitment tothe preservation and effective utilization of ourenvironment.It is a source of comfort to us that all this has beenachieved in an environment of social and politicalstability. We must  however  sound the warning bells  aswe note with great foreboding the practice by some ofdeporting to our countries hardened criminals who havelearned and practised their trade in their adoptedhomelands for several decades. In like manner  theunwarranted disruption and dismantling of familiesthrough inhumane immigration laws requires the attentionof this Organization.I respectfully submit that in all our deliberations andactions  as indeed in every aspect of human endeavour the aspirations and legitimate expectations of the peoplemust be central. The 21.5 million people of the Republicof China on Taiwan aspire to be represented in this body.They have a legitimate expectation that their country  afounding Member of the United Nations  should have itsmembership restored. We cannot but lend them oursupport. Ours must be a policy of inclusion.A cursory look at our agenda reveals 21 itemsdealing with the financing of United Nationspeacekeeping or observer missions  all associated withwar  threats of war  “ethnic cleansing”  terrorism and thelike. This suggests that although much has been achieved much more must be done. We must focus our attention onthe preservation of peace and security  thereby reducingthe need for the restoration of peace and security.There should be no compromise in the fight againstterrorism  whether it be in Kenya  Tanzania or NorthernIreland. We note and are glad for the encouraging signsemanating from the Middle East. We should take our cuefrom the famous British politician who said “To jaw-jaw2is better than war-war”  and seek to settle our disputespeacefully in the spirit of our Charter.By the time this fifty-third session of the GeneralAssembly comes to a close  many speeches will have beendelivered from this podium  articulate  substantive speeches delivered by men and women who together hold and wieldenormous power.The peoples of the world have heard us talk. But isthat all they want from us? I submit that the answer is aresounding no. They want action. An agenda that includes165 items suggests that much work lies ahead of us. Yet Ipropose one additional task: that the Secretary-General andhis able team of professionals subject all of our speeches todetailed scrutiny and analysis and  in keeping with thedirective of the Summit of the Americas  let us “put wordsinto deeds”.In this way  we will give the lie to those critics whoclaim this place is only a talk shop  and demonstrate tothem that it is indeed an action station.The Commonwealth of Dominica and the CaribbeanCommunity hold dearly to the principles enshrined in theCharter of the United Nations. We are firmly committed toworking with all Members and nations to bring about animproved quality of life for all the peoples of this world."
"47",1962,"DNK",53,1998,"Let me first associatemyself with the statement by my colleague  the AustrianMinister of Foreign Affairs  on behalf of the EuropeanUnion.We embark upon this session of the General Assemblyin the midst of challenges that affect all continents. We candeal with those challenges only if we display resolve and acommon vision.That vision  clear and simple  is enshrined in theCharter of the United Nations. We must strive to maintaininternational peace and security  respect for human rightsand dignified living conditions for all. Every State joiningthe United Nations has committed itself to that vision.To realize our vision  the rule of law must prevail. Webase our national societies on the rule of law  and much ismade of the rule of law within our societies. The rule oflaw offers the strongest defense against arbitrary exerciseof power  but we sometimes neglect its importance in theinternational context.My call for greater commitment to the rule of lawinternationally is not meant to belittle the progress made.The Charter has inspired an impressive body of specifictreaty law governing the behaviour of States. Laws onhuman rights  disarmament  the environment and outerspace  and the law of the sea and international trade laware important examples.We celebrate this year the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  proclaimed bythe General Assembly in December 1948. TheDeclaration covers civil and political rights  as well aseconomic  social  and cultural rights. It has had animmense impact upon the standard-setting work of theUnited Nations and within each Member State.Human rights are universal. They must beguaranteed to all persons without discrimination andobserved by all countries irrespective of their form ofgovernment. That is the essence of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. Indeed  it would becontradictory to talk about human rights if they were notaccorded to all human beings  wherever they live.To deny the universality of human rights is to denyour common humanity. Freedom from torture  forexample  must be respected everywhere  regardless oflocal traditions or local problems. Obviously  situationsdiffer  but the human rights foundation is the sameeverywhere.All States in Vienna in 1993 reaffirmed that theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights constitutes acommon standard of achievement for all peoples and allnations. All States further proclaimed that the promotionand protection of human rights is a legitimate concern ofthe international community.A feature of present-day international law is that  bynow  we have almost all the standards against which tohold Governments accountable for their acts. What we arestill missing is an effective international machinery toensure the implementation of all the rules in practice â€”to move from declarations to deeds. I wish to pay specialtribute to the many human rights defenders who strugglein the front line for the defence of our common humanvalues  often at the greatest personal risk.15It is a most proper contribution by the United Nationsto adopt this year a declaration for the protection of thework of human rights defenders  those who strive to realizethe solemn pledges contained in the Universal Declarationof Human Rights.We also warmly welcome the progress made in firmlyestablishing the rights of indigenous peoples.Another landmark contribution was achieved this yearthrough the historic adoption in Rome of a Statute for apermanent International Criminal Court. Time and again we have observed the failure of national criminal lawsystems to punish the perpetrators of atrocities and thosebehind them. The shocking events from Cambodia  theformer Yugoslavia  Rwanda  and now Kosovo andelsewhere are fresh on our minds.The prospects for reconciliation and lasting peace areundermined if the perpetrators remain at large. A keyobjective of the International Criminal Court is exactly torestore the rule of law and end impunity. This is a matternot only of justice  but also of peace and security. The adhoc Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia havebeen an important first step  but only a preliminary step.We need a permanent institution.Denmark urges all States to ratify the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court. It is an urgent task to set thishistoric building block in the construction of internationalsociety in place. In light of experiences gained  the door isopen for adjusting the functioning of the Court to the needsof the world community. The review clause in theStatute â€” a proposition strongly advocated by Denmark allalong in the negotiations â€” assures that.The signature in December last year in Ottawa by 121States of the Convention to ban the use and production ofanti-personnel landmines has established a very importantnorm in international humanitarian law. For too long hasthis inhumane  indiscriminate weapon been allowed toclaim thousands of innocent civilian victims every year. Wewelcome the entry into force of the Convention by 1 March1999. Let us now intensify our joint efforts to clear themany mines already in the ground. Denmark offers itscontinued support.A most disturbing factor in the international legalorder are the terrorist attacks taking innocent lives andjeopardizing relations among States. The internationalcommunity must continue to condemn all acts  methods andpractices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable underall circumstances  wherever and by whomsoever committed.No ends justify such means  but  apparently condemnation is not enough. We need to furtherstrengthen international cooperation to prevent  combatand eliminate terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations. There must be no safe haven for terrorists.Those responsible for terrorist acts must be brought tojustice. If traditional extradition agreements cannot bringabout such a result  less traditional arrangements must becontemplated  as envisaged in regard to the horrendousterrorist bombing over Lockerbie.In May this year  India  regrettably  decided toresume nuclear testing after 24 years of self-imposedrestraint. Pakistan  regrettably  followed Indiaâs lead andconducted its own tests for the first time. These tests notonly contradict the non-test norm that had developed overthe past two years. They also endanger peace and stabilityin the region and internationally. Therefore  the nucleartesting by India and Pakistan is of legitimate concern tothe international community.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons enjoys almost universal support. A substantialnumber of countries have ratified the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  and more are following everymonth. These two Treaties are the cornerstones of theinternational non-proliferation regime and the foundationfor the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. I urge thosecountries â€” including India and Pakistan â€” that have notyet done so  to sign and move to ratify these Treatieswithout condition.This year marks the first half-century of UnitedNations peacekeeping. The first mission was established50 years ago  based on the goals of the United NationsCharter. Since then  United Nations peacekeeping hasdeveloped norms and principles of its own: consent of theparties  impartiality and non-use of force. These principlescontinue to guide the international communityâs efforts insecuring peace and stability on all continents.Peacekeeping operations are an important illustrationof the resolve of the international community  representedby the United Nations. Their successes are real. In theMiddle East and Cyprus  the United Nations has been asource of stability for many years. In Mozambique United Nations peacekeepers have demobilized thousandsof combatants and made room for democratic elections.In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  the16United Nations preventive deployment remains an essentialstabilizing factor. And in Bosnia and Herzegovina today the United Nations is responsible for the crucial task oftraining and restructuring local police forces.Denmark has a long tradition of contributing to UnitedNations peacekeeping operations. Danish forces took partfrom the very beginning and have served the UnitedNations faithfully for the last five decades. In recent years Danish forces have served all over the world  from theMiddle East to the Balkans  as well as in Asia and inAfrica.Todayâs peacekeeping challenges differ from those ofearlier decades and much work has been done to adjust theUnited Nations to the new challenges. Denmark has takenan active part in the process. Together with other countries Denmark aims to improve the United Nations capacity forrapid reaction within the framework of the standby system.Denmark is also engaged in the creation of a newpeacekeeping capacity of the Baltic States and of southernAfrica.The demand for adjustment and reform continues.There is still work to be done in areas such as preplanningand logistic support. But peacekeeping goes beyond militaryoperations. A broader  integrated approach involvingcomponents such as civilian police  preventive diplomacyand humanitarian assistance is called for. Such conceptualflexibility will add to the strength of United Nationspeacekeeping.We  the United Nations Members  must be ready tomeet our obligations and equip the Organization with thenecessary tools for these future challenges. We must also of course  ensure the safety of personnel working for theUnited Nations.We are witnessing an enhanced role for regionalorganizations. Their special expertise has proved valuablein addressing causes of conflict and establishing a basis forsettlement. The Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe is a good example.A division of labour between organizations isnecessary  but it must not lead to confusion in leadershipand responsibility. The United Nations remains the coreinstitution in the international legal order and must maintaina central role in international efforts to ensure peace andsecurity.We are approaching the twenty-first century  acentury in which international society also should begoverned by the rule of law. The norms of internationallaw are universal but  sadly  they are not alwaysuniversally respected.Respect for national sovereignty cannot be invokedas an excuse to avoid the obligations of internationalcooperation and international law. International criticismof violations of human rights and of internationalhumanitarian law is fully legitimate.The role of the United Nations in this respectremains crucial. Indeed  direct intervention by theinternational community through the United Nations canbe fully justified and legitimate  including in grave casesof humanitarian law being violated.Respect for the rule of law in international relationscan be ensured only if the international community andthe United Nations possess the instruments and theresolve to act. In this respect  regrettably  we must notea certain paralysis in recent years in the face of gravehumanitarian conflicts and emergencies.Disagreement among Member States on how to dealwith a particular crisis weakens the resolve of the UnitedNations to act. But we must  unfortunately  also note alack of general support for the United Nations in certainquarters. The least we can expect from Members is forthem to make the necessary resources available for theOrganization  inter alia  by paying their contributions infull  on time and without conditions.We must find ways which enhance the ability of theUnited Nations to deal with violations of internationalpeace and security and other serious breaches ofinternational law. Failure to act on such challenges ismorally indefensible and betrays the principles of theUnited Nations Charter.Violations and breaches must be met convincingly with resolve and with the legitimacy of international law.Legitimacy will usually be provided by the SecurityCouncil. That is how it should be. Disagreement in theSecurity Council about a particular line of action must however  never lead to the paralysis of the internationalcommunity.If  for instance  members of the Security Councilcannot agree on a mandate for a peace operation  theymust allow for other possibilities for effective action.17When faced with an urgent agenda  the option should notbe action or no action  but what line of action.There will usually be a broad range of actionsavailable for the international community. It is a questionof choice and political will. It does not suffice to leaveeverything to the humanitarian agencies. Emergency relief however necessary  is not a substitute for political action.A reform of the Security Council can serve tostrengthen the authority of the Council. But in the end wedepend on the readiness of the members of the Council toact and to apply the same yardstick to all cases.I should also like to emphasize the role andprerogatives of the Secretary-General in the field of peaceand security. The Secretary-General has exercised thesefunctions in a highly commendable way.Before concluding  I wish to refer to the normativerole of the United Nations as an important aspect of therule of law. In particular  the United Nations conferences ofthe past decade have set valuable norms for improvingliving conditions for mankind. Common standards havebeen set in such important areas as eradication of poverty environmentally sustainable development  gender equalityand promotion and protection of human rights.Achievements have been made in meeting thesestandards  but much remains to be done. The responsibilityfalls both to Member States and to the internationalinstitutions. The United Nations system must ensure  on itspart  an effective and coordinated follow-up to the globalUnited Nations conferences.It is our collective responsibility to ensure that thefinancial resources are provided to attain these commonstandards. Denmark will continue to contribute developmentassistance in the amount of 1 per cent of our gross nationalproduct.Let me conclude by expressing my conviction that thebest way to promote the rule of law in internationalrelations is through respect for democratic norms in ourown societies.The norm-setting activities of the United Nations havegiven an indispensable impetus towards democratization andgood governance. Assistance to the establishment ofdemocratic institutions in developing countries andcountries with economies in transition can also make animportant contribution. This is an overriding objectives ofDenmarkâs considerable assistance to those countries.Whatever challenges we face to the internationallegal order  we must never fail in our determination tofollow the words of the preamble of the Charter:â€œto reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  inthe dignity and worth of the human person  in theequal rights of men and women and of nations largeand smallâ€."
"48",2007,"DOM",53,1998,"The Dominican Republic wishes to expressits gratitude for the gestures of solidarity expressed byfriendly countries with regard to the passage of the terriblehurricane  Georges  which struck our country yesterday.Furthermore  we appeal to the generosity of theinternational community to provide cooperation with a viewto facing both the immediate emergencies of the populationaffected by this phenomenon and the process of nationalrecovery.The delegation of the Dominican Republic  on behalfof the Government presided over by Mr. Leonel Fernández wishes to extend its warmest congratulations to thePresident of the General Assembly  the Minister for ForeignAffairs of Uruguay  on his well-deserved election to presideover the fifty-third session  which is taking place at a timeof great structural changes in global society and within ourOrganization. We also wish to thank Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  who presided over the deliberations of the lastsession of the General Assembly with such skill. Ourgratitude goes also to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his devotion and efforts to guide theOrganization along the path towards modernization andreform  which will strengthen us as we reach the newmillennium.The changes in the realities of the world in whichwe live make it necessary to revise international policy.In this respect  the United Nations  being the universalforum  must be strengthened and renewed by increasingits activities in areas such as peace and security ofnations  the protection of human rights and theenvironment and cooperation for socio-economic andcultural development.Faithful to its principles  the United Nations mustcontinue to encourage and deepen its programme ofreforms  taking into consideration not only the complexityof the current reality  but also the future development ofregulations aimed at relieving social marginalization andethnic and religious tensions  which jeopardize the priorityobjectives of peace and development for our peoples. TheDominican Republic expresses its firm support for thenegotiations and consultations on the programme ofreform. We trust that the process will culminate insubstantial changes in the various organs of the UnitedNations  enhancing their effectiveness and leading to amore democratic  transparent and representativeOrganization  thus ensuring its ability to act to achieve itspresent objectives.Fortunately  the constant threat of a nuclear war hasdiminished. Today  however  we are faced with thechallenge of combating together  and on a global scale hunger  poverty  environmental destruction and theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction  andencourage equitable development and free societies. Wemust also struggle to lay the bases of economic growth.There are other security problems that requiredecisive action: international terrorism  organized crimeand illicit trafficking in arms and drugs. We must createreliable instruments to put an end to these evils andachieve acceptable levels of security for our citizens sothat they can live in peace. The politics of security isinspired by the vision of a democratic world that practicessolidarity. Security must be achieved on the basis ofpolitical  economic  social and ecological cooperation. Theprinciple of sovereign equality of States and the beliefthat conflicts of interest must be resolved peacefullyrequire global cooperation because security can beachieved only with the participation of all States.41That task falls principally to the Security Council. TheDominican Republic believes it necessary to enlarge theCouncil by creating new seats for the regions of LatinAmerica  Asia and Africa  thus strengthening it in thefulfilment of its functions and allowing for greaterrepresentativity.The Dominican Republic believes that internationalpeace and stability are prerequisites for a secure future formankind. Democracy and respect for human rights  togetherwith justice and respect for the law  are the surest ways ofpreserving peace. General acceptance of these principlescannot be imposed  but it can be actively promoted.The crisis spots that afflict large segments of theworld?s population continue to be of concern to manyStates. We emphasize the need to strengthen mechanismsof dialogue and negotiation in conflict areas such as theBalkans  the Middle East and the Great Lakes region inAfrica. With regard to the Republic of China on Taiwan the Dominican Republic reiterates the positions presentedby its President  Mr. Leonel Fernández  with regard to theneed for the international community to consider theimportance of that country  due to its geographic location for the peace  security and prosperity of that region. Wefavour constructive dialogue between both sides of theTaiwan Strait to bring about understanding and mutualcooperation. We reiterate that the parallel participation ofboth countries in the United Nations would be conducive tothe maintenance of peace.The Dominican Republic is also committed to theprocess of nuclear disarmament and vigorously protests therecent nuclear tests  as these can endanger world peace. Wereaffirm the need for strict respect for international treatieson the prohibition  emplacement and testing of nuclearweapons  in the atmosphere  in the oceanic subsoil and onthe ocean floor. We urge nuclear-weapon States to use andhandle those weapons responsibly as the only protection forthose of us who do not have that type of defence. Thepreservation of world peace demands that Member Statesof the United Nations establish new nuclear-weapon-freezones and protect those already existing as a guarantee ofsecurity.Concern for the preservation of a zone free of nuclearcontamination is shared by the nations of the Caribbean which is used as a transportation route for toxic and nuclearwastes. For those countries among us that depend largelyon tourism based on sun and beaches  the coastal waterquality is vital to that important sector of our economies.Ongoing trafficking in illicit arms represents anotherthreat to security. The arms build-up must definitively bestopped. The relevant international conventions signed bythe Dominican Republic are very important  such as theone on illicit trafficking in conventional weapons.Peaceful settlement of conflicts by means ofdialogue and accord is the best method to eliminate theuse of force in political relations within and amongMember countries. For that reason  it is necessary toenhance the efforts and mechanisms recognized byinternational law in order to resolve internationalconflicts. In that context  the Dominican Republic acceptsand defends multilateralism as the appropriate way ofachieving consensus on the main problems that afflict theworld population. Poverty  drug-trafficking  terrorism inter-ethnic and territorial conflicts are problems that mustnot be dealt with unilaterally.For that reason we support the strengthening ofestablished international systems of justice. The signingof the Statute of the International Criminal Court isurgently needed to achieve these ends. We believe thatthe instruments to protect peace must be used beforeconflicts occur. The United Nations must take preventiveaction and respond rapidly and effectively to avoid laterconsequences. In that respect  the Convention on theelimination of anti-personnel landmines  signed by manyMember States of the United Nations at Ottowa  Canada constitutes an important step and commitment towards theconsolidation of mechanisms for world peace.Firmly based on the principle of encouraging thepeaceful resolution of disputes and the search for peaceand security in our region  the Dominican Republic haspromoted the strengthening of its neighbourly relations.For the first time in more than half a century  aDominican President visited the Republic of Haiti. Thatevent and the agreements reached favour the effortsundertaken by the democratic Governments of both Statesthrough dialogue and accord  which is the best way toapproach their common problems.It is in this new context of our bilateral relations thatwe wish to appeal to the international community tocontinue to provide support to Haiti. The need thatbrought about the commitment of the United Nations tothe recovery of our neighbouring country still remains.The Dominican Republic has met the challenges ofworld changes at the end of this century. The restorationof diplomatic relations with the fraternal country of Cuba42constituted an inevitable step that formalized our long-lasting relations with Cuba.Our country seeks inclusion in the integrationist trendin our geographic and geopolitical area. Thus  this year wesigned two free-trade treaties  one with the five countries ofCentral America  and the other with the 14 members of theCaribbean Community. Both agreements are modern advanced and comprehensive  as they deal with trade ingoods and services and with investment and are in keepingwith the principles of the World Trade Organization. Theyare conducive to economic growth  the creation of moreand better jobs and improvement in the quality of life ofour citizens.Other clear signs of this regional rapprochement andparticipation are the two presidential events held in ourcountry. In November 1997 the city of Santo Domingo wasthe site of the extraordinary summit of heads of State of theCentral American countries  including Belize  as well as ofthe Dominican Republic  and more recently  in August ofthis year  of the extraordinary meeting of heads of State andGovernment of the Caribbean Forum. Both meetings led toagreements and concrete positions regarding hemisphericand global challenges that our region must confront.At the same time  we have tightened our economic political and development ties with the other nations of ourregion  through the presence of our President  Mr. LeonelFernández  at the Summit of the Americas and the Ibero-American Summit through bilateral visits and exchanges atthe presidential level with the United States  Mexico Venezuela and Colombia  countries with which wetraditionally share close bonds. These regular presidentialexchanges have led to consensus on basic topics on theinternational agenda and have deepened our levels ofcooperation.Allow me now to speak out the values of democracyfrom a basically social approach  since people are the trueand ultimate raison d?être of democracy. Human rights andfundamental freedoms will be fully respected andguaranteed only when each citizen has a reasonable lifeexpectancy with access to health systems and theopportunity for education in a healthy ecologicalenvironment.As is well known  in order to achieve these objectives large public expenditures in these areas are necessary. Twofactors make this difficult: the external debt  a heavyburden which has dragged us down since the 1980s  and thecurrent financial crisis  which affects various countries ofthe world  including some in Latin America. Both factorsdrain away resources that could have financed socialdevelopment in this part of the world. The consequencesare obvious. Unable to improve the living conditions ofour people and help them become integrated into theglobal economy  poverty grows and democracy andstability are weakened.The greatest problem facing the internationalcommunity is how to deal with the enormous economicand social imbalance from which most Member Statessuffer  with the gap between the rich and the poorcountries and with the growth in global poverty. The roleof the United Nations should be strengthened informulating and coordinating policies for cooperation andin providing technical and financial assistance todeveloping countries.Human resources must take priority during thecurrent transformation of the international  political andeconomic order. Women in particular must play animportant role  as they constitute a dedicated  responsibleand active workforce and give us reasons to seehumankind as being at the centre of development andprogress.The Dominican Republic understands thatstrengthening the role of women in the political  socialand economic life of Member States is essential if we areto reduce poverty and social inequality and promotedemocracy and sustainable development. That is why it isessential to give priority to policies and programmes thatbroaden women?s participation in these areas.We vigorously support the objectives and work ofthe United Nations International Research and TrainingInstitute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW).The plans to improve the contribution of women to thedevelopment of their countries  in accordance with theirown needs  set up when INSTRAW was created continues to be of primary importance and deservescontinued support from Member States.Creating a new international order is a politicalchallenge. The conditions for this new order require themultilateral system to guarantee security and governabilitywithin the framework of respect for human rights. Incelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  which has been a guidinglight for building a more just world  we hope that respectfor human rights will become daily practice for allpeople.43In conclusion  we believe that the United Nations mustreflect on and accept the changes that are necessary for ourOrganization. That is why we enthusiastically support thereform programme  which will hope will respond to theexpectations of a United Nations in tune with our time."
"49",2054,"DZA",53,1998,"Aunanimous tribute has been paid to you  Sir  and  throughyou  to your country  Uruguay  by your election to thepresidency at this session of the General Assembly. I ampleased to join in that tribute by congratulating you onthis well-deserved distinction and wishing you all successin the discharge of your mission.I should also like to pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Udovenko  who was able to meet our expectations inexemplary fashion at a time when our Organization wasembarking on a course of reform. Mr. Kofi Annan hasfully committed himself  with imagination and courage  tothat same course of reform  and he has succeeded inmaking strides that call for our sincere expression ofgratitude and recognition.That reform is now on the right course. It is meetingthe collective expectations that have been expressed. Butmore than that  it comes at the right moment  just as newproblems are arising to test our skills in diagnosing thenew challenges and in formulating policies that arecapable of responding to these challenges and aspirations.However new these problems may be  they are anatural consequence of humanity’s progress towards thefulfilment of its destiny. They have arisen out of theunprecedentedly swift changes that have taken place ininternational relations for a full decade.These problems have names. They presentchallenges that were heretofore unknown to us  and theydemand solutions that go beyond our customaryframeworks of thought  analysis and action. Let us firstidentify these problems by their names: globalization interdependence  development  peace and collectivesecurity.These are but workshops which nourish our diversedebates and contradictory approaches. They raisedcertainties on the part of some and doubts and warningson the part of others. Until now  the debate has beenlimited to exchanges of ideas  confined to the approachesor projections that each of us has formulated from ourown perspectives  our own calculations and our own20national interests. Today  the facts themselves have beendetermined. It is incumbent upon us to confront whatyesterday was nothing but conjecture and today is a livingreality  in keeping with the principles and ideals of theUnited Nations which our countries embody.This is the case with globalization  which was longpresented to us as being capable of ensuring universalprosperity  and to which was attributed the virtue oflimitless growth. However  many of our countries haveexpressed their doubts  their warnings of the dislocationsand dangers which would result from a globalization whichlacks the least means of appropriate regulation  coordinationand monitoring. In the absence of such instruments ofregulation  coordination and monitoring  and given theacknowledged shortcomings of the existing mechanisms globalization rightly gives rise more often to doubts andfears than to support and conviction.There is no better illustration of the tragicconsequences which could result from those dislocationsthan the Asian crisis  the results of which are stillunfolding  threatening the economies of many regions ofthe world to such a degree that the spectre of widespreadrecession has re-emerged. In fact  rather than being a forcefor integration  globalization has turned into a force forexclusion and marginalization.This state of affairs forces us to think collectivelyabout how to reimbue globalization with its original andideal purpose so that it can meet the aspirations placed init for universal progress in justice and solidarity.Globalization represents a comprehensive challenge whichmust be met by comprehensive regulation  coordination anddialogue. Until then  the existing mechanisms must bestrengthened in their assigned functions of prevention andinterposition.Finally  regional integration as an integral componentof a well-balanced and carefully monitored globalization must be accompanied by bold and effective initiatives.The problem of interdependence is structurally linkedto that of globalization. The arrival of an age ofinterdependence among nations has fed the great hope ofcreating and diversifying the bonds that are necessary forexpanding the area of cooperation and exchange among ourcountries. However  the erosion of international cooperationfor development  as well as the imbalances in the presentsystem of world economic relations  still represent basicimpediments on the road to crystallizing true interdependentrelationships.At the core of the problem of globalization andinterdependence is development — a crucial problem which has not yet received the attention that is due to it.On the contrary  it is increasingly marginalized in ourdiscussions today  as well as in the design of worldeconomic policies.Finally  the problem of peace and collective securityhas encountered new challenges other than those withwhich it was identified before and which still exist tilltoday.From this perspective  I speak of the phenomenon ofterrorism. Terrorism has no respect for human life and iscapable of perpetrating the most vile crimes againsthumankind. By its logic of terror  death and destruction it seeks to strike at the foundations of every civilizedsociety. For these reasons  terrorism is truly characterizedas the most serious threat to our societies and the nationsof the world as a whole.Terrorism is a global phenomenon which calls for aglobal response from the international community. Algeriais pleased to note that after having underestimated andincorrectly analysed terrorism for a long time  theinternational community increasingly seems to be morecognizant of its dangers and aware that the time has cometo supplement unilateral and isolated action on the part ofStates fighting terrorism with collective and resoluteaction.With this perspective in mind  conditions are nowright for us to go beyond mere verbal condemnation ofterrorism to ensure that intentions and actions wouldreally go hand in hand through effective internationalcooperation whose goal is to fight terrorism. Theelimination of this scourge is no longer a mere moralobligation for humankind. It has also become a politicalnecessity in an age of interdependence and globalization.For that reason Algeria believes that the time hascome to give serious consideration to the preparation ofa global convention to prevent and fight all acts ofterrorism and to serve as a legal framework for theorganization and implementation of internationalcooperation in that matter. Such a project should takeshape as of now in the form of concerted and sustainedaction on the part of the entire international community todismantle terrorism’s multifaceted support networks andrear bases  dry up its financial resources and bring to trialthe perpetrators of terrorist acts and their accomplices andabettors. The convening of a world summit on terrorism 21which received broad support in this Assembly  would bea basic step in that direction. Algeria fully supports the ideaof such a summit and stands completely ready to make itscontribution to it.In view of Algeria’s belonging to several spheres —the Maghreb  the Mediterranean  the Arab and theAfrican — it has constructed its foreign policy on theprinciples of openness  solidarity  good-neighbourliness andcooperation. Algeria embodies these principles in itsimmediate environment  the Maghreb  convinced that onlya united Maghreb community would serve the cause ofpeace  stability and the development of the countries of ourregion.These same principles have moved Algeria to tirelesssupport for a just and definitive solution to the conflict inWestern Sahara. We fully support the United Nationssettlement plan  in cooperation with the Organization ofAfrican Unity  which calls for the holding of a free  fairand impartial referendum on self-determination.Like the rest of the international community  Algeriawelcomes the Houston accord  through which the twoparties to the conflict  the Kingdom of Morocco and thePOLISARIO front  solemnly agreed on the practicalmodalities for implementing the provisions of the settlementplan under the auspices of the United Nations. Today  oneyear after the conclusion of that accord  and despite thereal  significant progress resulting  in large part  from theefforts of the Secretary-General  of his Personal EnvoyMr. James Baker  and of his Special Representative  seriousobstacles still stand in the path to the plan’simplementation. If they are not overcome  these obstacles which the Secretary-General has clearly identified insuccessive reports  along with their causes  could seriouslycompromise the chances of holding the long-awaitedreferendum.Therefore it is now necessary to solemnly and urgentlyappeal for full and strict respect for the commitmentsundertaken and to reaffirm the responsibility of the UnitedNations  in particular the Security Council  with regard tothe full and strict implementation of the settlement plan andthe Houston accord so as to ensure that the people of theWestern Sahara can exercise their inalienable right to selfdetermination.As in the Maghreb  Algeria has been working in theMediterranean to ensure that there will be an atmosphere ofstability  peace  cooperation and prosperity. The machineryfor consultation and cooperation that was set up through theBarcelona process has opened new horizons for thedevelopment of a true partnership between the two shoresof that shared sea  a partnership directed towardsdeveloping a zone of shared prosperity in theMediterranean. In this context  Algeria undertooknegotiations on an agreement of association with theEuropean Union aimed at putting in place the conditionsnecessary for renewed and mutually beneficialcooperation between the two parties.Within the same Mediterranean region  and after thelaunching of the peace process which raised great hopes feelings of anxiety and pessimism have again returnedsince the peace mechanism has become stalemated.The Israeli Administration  by reneging oncommitments made in Oslo and Washington  byabandoning the principle of land for peace  by continuingits settlement policy and by repeatedly attacking theintegrity and sacredness of Al-Quds Al-Sharif  has led tothe undermining of the peace process  rekindling thefrustrations and anger of the Palestinian people andthreatening the entire region with a return to the era ofconfrontation which prevailed there for more than 40years.In order to deal with this perilous situation  we mustrecall that the just  comprehensive and lasting settlementto the conflict in the Middle East requires the full andunconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from all thePalestinian and occupied Arab territories and the exerciseof the right of self-determination by the Palestinianpeople  including the establishment of its own State withAl-Quds as its capital.In the same part of the world  the suffering of thebrotherly Iraqi people continues to dismay us. In thisregard  we cannot but reiterate our call for the rapidlifting of the embargo on Iraq. Similarly  we renew thesame call with regard to the brotherly Libyan people  whoare also the victims of cruel economic sanctions  whichwe hope will be lifted soon  in view of the recent positivedevelopments in the Lockerbie case.In its relations with its African neighbours  as in itsrelations with other African countries  Algeria has alwaysworked to ensure that there will be strong bonds ofcooperation and solidarity with a view to achieving thepolitical and economic unification of the continent.Intrastate and inter-State conflicts in Africa can onlydamage this ambitious and legitimate project. Wetherefore call for the settlement of these conflicts and22crises by utilizing existing African mechanisms  particularlythe Mechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution  on the basis of respect for the territorialintegrity and sovereignty of States and also the frontiersinherited from colonialization.For a decade Africa has been making profoundpolitical  economic and social reforms for which theinternational community must provide resolute andmeaningful support  as the Secretary-General of ourOrganization called for in his comprehensive and thoroughreport.In less than two months the international communitywill be celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. Such anniversaries providea good opportunity for collective self-review  which impelsus to acknowledge that in the field of human rights  thesituation is certainly much better than it was 50 years ago.The people’s liberation movement and the global spread ofdemocracy have certainly played a crucial role in promotingand consolidating human rights.There can be no doubt that the significant progressmade in democratization and the establishment within theState of the rule of law will remain fragile and will beendangered unless they are accompanied by meeting theeconomic  social and cultural needs of the citizens. This isbecause true democracy cannot take root permanently andsoundly in places of deprivation and want.In this connection and in the name of my country  Iwish to reaffirm our strong attachment to the universality interdependence and indivisibility of human rights and ourresolute commitment to promote them free from anymanipulation or politicization.If we wish to sum up these complex and multifariouschallenges facing mankind today  this could be donethrough one essential question: how can we make sure thatthe evolving new world order will be more just and moresecure  will have greater solidarity and will truly addressthe interests and aspirations of everyone?That is the question which  of course  involves ourcountry  and through it  mankind as a whole. And whatbetter forum to answer this question is there than theUnited Nations  which brings us together and throughwhose Charter we have proclaimed our determination “topractise tolerance and live together in peace with oneanother as good neighbours  and to unite our strength tomaintain international peace and security  and ... to employinternational machinery for the promotion of theeconomic and social advancement of all peoples”.The challenges of the present are embodied in thesebasic values and these shared purposes. In fact  theprimacy given to these values and the attainment of thesepurposes are contingent on our ability to mobilize ourcollective energies. Mankind  which has mastered scienceand technology  has achieved considerable progress in theutilization of the resources of our world and hasestablished its control over the means of its progress.Now it has in its hands the keys to its destiny. Using thekeys to its destiny for the common good depends onhumankind  and on humankind alone."
"50",2101,"ECU",53,1998,"When I assumed the presidency of my countryless than two months ago  I recalled that in the tradition ofthe Aymara  an indigenous people of the Republic ofBolivia  a human being and a country — and  may I say the United Nations — do their work if they manage to findharmony in seven fundamental fields.For the Aymaras there is a type of harmony that risesfrom the head  and that is the harmony we need to maintainwith our beliefs and principles.There is a second type of harmony which goes fromthe feet down. That is the harmony we must maintainwith nature  the Earth and the environment.There is a third harmony that goes from the bodyout to the right side. That is the harmony we must havewith our families  with those closest to us.A fourth type of harmony moves towards the left.That is the harmony we must have with our neighbours our colleagues at work and those others who  withoutbeing very close to us  surround us.There is a fifth type of harmony which movesforward from us  and for the Aymara people that isharmony with the past. They believe that human beingsface the past and not the future  because we can see whatis in front of us  and the past is the only thing we canreally see.A sixth type of harmony is behind us. That is ourharmony with the future  because although we do not seethe future we have an intuition about it and a sense of it.Often  although it has not yet come  we can already feelits weight on our shoulders.The seventh and final type of harmony is self-harmony  an inner harmony.If we achieve harmony in those seven areas  we willhave a harmonious body  a harmonious country and aharmonious world. It is with that vision that we havebegun to govern in Ecuador; and I believe it is with thatvision that the United Nations is doing its work.We can discuss many issues here. I want to focus ontwo  both related to left-sided harmony — harmony withour neighbours  international harmony — and theirimplications for the development of our peoples.In Latin America  as in many parts of the world  weface one of the gravest crises in our history. We have beenconsidering the advantages of globalization. Now we arealso suffering the problems of globalization. When wespeak of a global system  we speak of a real network which  like a large cobweb  encompasses us all. Theproblem with such a network is that wherever we touch orapply pressure to the web we produce a vibration and animpact throughout the web.The great majority of the countries of Latin Americahave made enormous efforts to overcome the problems ofprevious decades. They have worked to reduce their fiscaldeficits to a minimum  to open up to the global economy to participate in trade and to share the principles of open fair and transparent trade  free of discrimination. They haveunderstood that integration is the tool for progress in thefuture. They have established regional markets  and nowthey seek a continental market. After so much effort  whichat times has been costly in internal terms  we have foundthat that effort can be wasted  that it may not be a way outof our problems  because of an international crisis  whichdid not originate in our countries; it came from outside  butbecause of globalization  and the network connecting us  weare all affected.We understand the mechanics of the system. Weunderstand how something that affects markets in Asia hasan impact on Latin America. Yet  while we understand themechanics of the system  we cannot see its fairness. Ifwhile working together we encounter problems that do notoriginate in our region  we must ask the industrializedcountries in particular to take decisions that will ensure thatnot all the countries of the world suffer to the extent thatwe are suffering now.There is talk of risk of a global recession as severe as or even more severe  than that of the 1930s. We see thestock markets of the largest countries of our region affecteddaily. We see a crisis that is already striking theindustrialized countries. I think this is the appropriate forumfor us to consider the need to work together. We smallcountries like Ecuador can do little in a crisis of thismagnitude but call for reflection and true fraternity amongour nations so that a problem affecting the whole worldcan be overcome. Otherwise  a crisis as big as this leavesmany of us with no option but to wait and see how wecan protect ourselves against these troubles.The countries of Latin America see ourselves as aregion  and we believe we must behave as a region. Everycountry has its own characteristics and has to do what isnecessary individually  but it is the region as a whole thatis being affected by all these changes.The countries of Latin America have not come heresimply to ask for money and loans  as they have done atother times of crisis. The countries of the region have notappeared here one by one to try to overcome theirdifficulties on an individual basis  as on other occasions.This time we have made joint proposals — just  globalproposals. We hope these proposals will yield results.All analysts maintain that unless interest rates arelowered  in particular in the industrialized countries  thisglobal trend is undoubtedly not going to change. The 0.25per cent drop in interest rates was widely consideredimportant but insufficient in view of the magnitude of thecurrent crisis. It is therefore crucial that we deal with thismatter here in the Assembly.Along with this international crisis  Ecuador isconfronting an issue that is fundamental to itsdevelopment: its relations with Peru  and the search for adefinitive peace with Peru. We have a problem that hasbeen dragged out over many decades. In its most recentstage  for the last 56 years  we have had a protocol ofpeace  friendship and boundaries  which should now entera definitive phase. Peace is our objective; we see it as anethical  moral and economic good. Nothing is moreadvantageous to the budgets of our countries than peace.We can do great things for the benefit of our economies.In this case  peace is accompanied by a set ofincentives  specifically  the possibility of $3 billion inloans from multilateral entities for border developmentprojects  irrigation  roads  agricultural systems  schoolsand health centres  to give a few examples. This $3billion — a very large sum for both countries — can beput into action if we achieve peace.Over the past three years  we have been holdingtalks. Commissions have reached agreements on borderintegration  trade  navigation in the extraordinarilyimportant basin of the Amazon river and measures ofsecurity and confidence-building for the future. But the2most delicate and difficult issue has yet to be resolved: theestablishment of the borderline between the two countries.We have held talks at a number of levels — among ourForeign Ministers  in the negotiating commissions  amongthe countries that are guarantors of the protocol — andthese conversations have also risen to the level of thepresidencies of Peru and Ecuador. We have had threemeetings in less than two months in order to seek that finalagreement. Last night  I spoke with President Fujimori; heis planning to travel to the United States  and we agreedthat tomorrow we will see each other here in New York fora fourth meeting to try to continue seeking the definitiveformula that will resolve the question of our border in away that is fitting  acceptable to the two countries andappropriate for our peoples.The principles are clear. As countries  we cannot enterthe twenty-first century dragging with us problems that dateback to the nineteenth. We must embark on the twenty-firstcentury with a clear and positive vision that is directedtowards the future.We share all the tenets of the United Nations on issuesrelated to this one. We are completely in agreement withthe Ottawa Convention on the question of landmines. Ourcountry signed that Convention  and at the end of last weekin Brasilia  the Presidents of Peru and Ecuador submitted toPresident Cardoso of Brazil a joint communiqué requestingthat plans be drawn up for the removal of all the landminesthat have been placed in the border area over the years.This is a positive and very real step; it means that theConvention will not simply be signed and ratified but willalso be applied in practical terms in the field.We are also completely in agreement with theproposals of the United Nations on the reduction of militarybudgets and expenditures. We believe that money should beinvested in poverty reduction and in the social programmesand projects our peoples need so much. We are completelyin agreement with the conventional disarmamentprogrammes. We believe that trust must replace distrust and we believe that this task  accomplished jointly  canallow us to leave behind long decades of mutual suspicionand the great scepticism that sometimes pervades ourcountries. We are in agreement as regards general andcomplete disarmament. We agree with the prohibition ofnuclear weapons. We welcome the decision of the SouthernCone Common Market (MERCOSUR) to make all thecountries of that region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone.We believe in peace  and we are working to achieveit. It will be hard to find  in the future  two Presidents ofneighbouring countries with a history of problems whoare so firmly committed to peace  so deeply convincedthat they must achieve peace  and so zealously at work toreach a speedy  just and honourable peace. We hope ourefforts will soon meet their reward.We completely support the initiatives of the UnitedNations on the subject of the protection of human rights.Ecuador has adopted its own national human rights planinto law. We are the second country in Latin America and one of the first in the world  to adopt such a plan. Itis not a plan of the Ecuadorian Government  but a planmade by Ecuadorian society  coordinated by the Ministrywith the participation of representatives of various sectorsof the society. We believe in human rights  and wedefend them in their entirety and without reservation. OurMinister for Foreign Affairs was the first United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights before joining ourMinistry for Foreign Relations  so our support in this fieldis complete.In addition  we are concerned about the issue ofsustainable development  and we will vigorously promoteenvironmental issues. For the first time in history  awoman from a country that is not in the northernhemisphere has become chairperson of the world’s largestintergovernmental organization on the environment. Thatwoman’s name is Yolanda Kakabadse  and she is thepresent Minister of the Environment in Ecuador. We seekto indicate several things by this  which are easilyunderstandable in what I have just said.These are the central issues in the link between theUnited Nations and my country: peace  the internationalcrisis and the search for a just global accord  theenvironment and human rights. Other issues could betaken up  but I prefer to focus on this message.I believe that there is no better way to pay tribute tothe United Nations and to commemorate the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsthan for two countries with democratically electedGovernments to seek peace and endeavour to sign a peaceagreement — perhaps sign one this year — so that thedevelopment of our peoples can proceed and their qualityof life can improve.In this way we can sum up the most importanthuman rights. Democracy  freedom  development  life  theright to work  gender-related issues  the problems ofminorities and the most disadvantaged groups and theprotection of children are encompassed in these wordsthat are so simple and so important: peace  developmentand international cooperation. We want to emphasize theseideas here  in this Organization which has done so much tobring them about throughout the world.I wish the Assembly every success in its work for thebenefit of all of humanity."
"51",2146,"EGY",53,1998,"Allow me at the outset to convey my sincerecongratulations to Mr. Opertti upon his election asPresident of the General Assembly at this session and toexpress my full confidence that he will lead its workwisely and ably.It gives me pleasure as well to pay tribute to thewise leadership of the former Foreign Minister ofUkraine  President of the Assembly at its last session particularly in promoting the efforts for reform andrenewal in the United Nations.14I would like also to salute the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  who displayed his wisdom and expertisein dealing with world crises and for his outstandingcontribution to increasing the efficiency of the Organizationin order for it to keep pace with the changing times contribute to the building of the new international order andavoid the pitfalls.This is the next-to-last session of the GeneralAssembly in this century. Let it be a session for reflectionand preparation for the last session of the twentieth century next year. Let us take stock of the international work of awhole century  its positive and negative aspects alike. Letus evaluate the achievements and innovations of mankind where it failed and why. Let us list and analyse the workdone and the progress made by the United Nations to createconstructive international cooperation and establish peace.Let us also talk about what remains on the internationalagenda and what will be left for succeeding generations tofinish and accomplish.In the Charter of the United Nations  we determinedto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.Have we done so? Where did we succeed  where did wefail  and why? We also reaffirmed our faith in fundamentalhuman rights and in the dignity of nations and humanbeings. How far have we gone in translating this solemnreaffirmation into a reality? We committed ourselves topromoting social progress and better standards of life  andto using the United Nations for the promotion of the socialand economic advancement of all peoples. Have wehonoured that commitment? We determined to practisetolerance and live together in peace and neighbourliness.Have we achieved that? We determined to unite ourstrength to maintain international peace and security and notto use armed force except for common interest. Has thisdetermination come true? Have we achieved what wedetermined to do?Immediately after the end of the cold war in the late1980s  some spoke of “the clash of civilizations”. This is adangerous theory that concerns humanity and the course itwill chart for itself — whether conflict and conflagration orcoexistence and peace. We  the representatives of theinternational community  cannot  at this historical juncture ignore such a dangerous argument and a destructive theorythat runs counter to the common work and collectiveobligations we agreed upon for international life. We  thechildren of the twentieth century  must deal with this theoryand respond to it clearly. We cannot let such a negative callgo without a response or correction. What President Clintonsaid in his address before the Assembly  rejecting thistheory and expressing respect for Islamic civilization  isreally worthy of consideration and appreciation.In our opinion  we must offer the next century ourconfident view that we are one community based onpluralism — intellectual  religious and cultural pluralismand diversity. We must reaffirm that this diversity doesnot prejudice the unity of the international community.Rather  it strengthens that unity  making the internationalcommunity a dynamic whole based on healthycompetition  positive coexistence and a commonappreciation for the achievements of the many societiesthat constitute the international community. Ourcommunity cannot be dependent on the achievements ofone single society or tend to follow one single culture.The true path lies in positive interaction  complementarityand coexistence among civilizations. It does not lie in thecreation of causes for conflict or in fanning the flames ofconfrontation and of clash between civilizations. If this isallowed to happen  it will create a dangerous hotbed ofworld tension and will ultimately result in a grave loss forone and all.Once again we are at a historic juncture where astrong message from this generation is indeed necessary.We want to see the rights of people and nations upheldwithout differences as to priorities and definitions. Wewant rational disarmament and an end to the arms racewithout distinction or discrimination. We want genuinedevelopment that does not entrench poverty or ignore itscauses. We want a clean environment  a science thatbenefits all and a technology whose achievements andapplications are beneficial to all. We want a commonposition in the face of international terrorism. We wantfreedom and liberation for all peoples and a firm stand inthe face of the forces of oppression  racism andoccupation. We want a commitment to the rule of lawand respect for established norms and for the purposesand principles we consensually consecrated in the Charterof the United Nations.In order to evaluate the experiences of the past andto chart our future course  I propose that this sessioncreate a committee to commence drafting a clearstatement to history to be issued at the close of the nextsession. This statement should include our assessment ofthe past and our vision of the future. It should be issueda few days before the end of the century and thebeginning of the new millennium.The world today is passing through a stage of chaos and there is a general feeling of discontent. Wars 15terrorism  backwardness  racism  religious intolerance: arethese the remnants of past eras? Or are they the result ofpractices that continue to plague our societies? Or are theyan integral part of the fabric of human life? Or are they theresult of globalization and the factors of tension andinstability contained in the new world order?I believe we all sense the instability in internationallife. We have witnessed and continue to witness widespreadacts of terrorism throughout all continents of the world. Wehave witnessed widespread extremism in various faiths andwidespread injustice in various societies. All this points tothe fact that richness and poverty  despite their undisputedimportance as two of the facts of life  do not constitute theonly causes of world instability. There are other causes foremost among which is the policy of double standards the lack of democracy in international relations  the brazencall for a clash of civilizations and the varyinginterpretations of the principles of legality. All theseelements lead to the feeling of discontent  indeed  to thegeneral feeling of insecurity.I believe it is incumbent upon us to consider thismatter. These questions call for a clear answer because thechallenge is enormous  and the results could therefore begrave. We are all in the same boat. This responsibility isnot the responsibility of any one society. If globalizationand universality are much talked about  this should meanthat they call for a sharing of responsibility.I would like to deal briefly with some of the centralissues that occupy our minds at this stage.I shall start with terrorism. Some note  and rightly so that this international crime against all societies isperpetrated using tight organizations  facilitated sometimesby circumstances in which some have misguidedlysupported certain groups by encouraging and dealing withthem until those groups turned against them. This is alesson we must learn in order to avoid its repetition.Furthermore  some have noted  and rightly so  that the handof terrorism has struck more than one place at the sametime: Nairobi  Dar-es-Salaam and Omagh in Ireland. Beforethen  that hand of terrorism struck many places in theworld  for different motives  certainly. But the phenomenonis one and the same  and it is intolerable. We must reflectupon this matter together.In this regard  I would like to underline the importanceof the legislation enacted by the British House of Commonson dealing with the acts of conspiracy committed on Britishterritory  of the proposal of President Jacques Chirac ofFrance on controlling the financing of terrorist groups and of what was said by President Clinton in hisstatement before the Assembly in this regard. I find itimportant also in this connection to put before theAssembly the call of President Hosni Mubarak to convenean international summit under the auspices of the UnitedNations. The summit should direct the internationalcommunity to deal with terrorism legally  politically economically and technologically. This call was supportedin the final communiqué of the recent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. I suggest that the General Assemblyconsider the Egyptian call for the proposed summit. I alsocall upon the Secretary-General to start working towardsits convening.Turning to disarmament  allow me to say that recentdevelopments have proved the shortcomings of thenuclear non-proliferation regime in its current form which lacks universality. This reaffirms the need forurgent and serious steps to remedy that shortcoming  andto strengthen the efficiency of the regime throughachieving its universality and avoiding the policy ofdouble standards; otherwise  we will end up with a stateof deep mistrust and an arms race that would in turn leadto the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction especially nuclear weapons.For the last three decades  Egypt has consistentlycalled for making the Middle East free from nuclearweapons. This call was further reinforced by its 1990initiative to make the region free from weapons of massdestruction. Today  we reiterate this call with a view tomaintaining peace and security in the region.Starting from this same premise  Egypt  togetherwith seven other States  recently proposed a new agendato strengthen the international commitment towards aworld free of weapons of mass destruction  an initiativewe invite the Assembly to support. In this connection allow me to place on record the call of President HosniMubarak to convene an international conference toconsider the elimination of those weapons from the wholeworld within an agreed time-frame. I invite members ofthe Assembly to work together in order to translate thatcall into a reality.I now move to the question of the reform of theUnited Nations. Here  the premise of the Egyptian policyis the same as that adopted by the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban: we call for commitment tothe principles of the Charter and international law as acommon position on the agenda for reform.16Here  I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his ideas and initiatives in this regard. I wouldalso like to reaffirm what the summit of the Non-AlignedMovement adopted concerning the importance of takinginto account the views of the Member States of the UnitedNations in the implementation of the reform policies andthe reaffirmation of the pivotal role of the GeneralAssembly in the decision-making process  as the maindemocratic framework of the United Nations.Concerning the Security Council  the position of Egyptis based on the same elements adopted by the non-alignedStates as follows: first  the need to deal with the questionsof the reform of the working methods of the SecurityCouncil and the expansion of its membership within anintegrated framework; secondly  increasing the membershipof the Security Council by no fewer than 11 members andthe allocation of a number of permanent seats fordeveloping countries  with strict observance of theprinciples of equitable geographical distribution andequality of States; thirdly  the unacceptability of anyattempt at a partial or selective expansion of themembership of the Security Council; fourthly  theinadmissibility of any predetermined time-frame tocomplete the process of restructuring the Security Council;and lastly  the need for any resolution that would result inamending the Charter  the so-called framework resolution to be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the StatesMembers of the United Nations  in accordance with Article108 of the Charter.In addition  Egypt is committed to the decision of thesummit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) inHarare in 1997 on the allocation of five non-permanentseats and two permanent seats for the African continent  tobe rotated in accordance with agreed criteria of the Groupof African States.On the subject of the reform of the United Nations  Iwould like to refer to a matter that was the subject ofextensive deliberations in the United Nations and in therecent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement — namely the sanctions imposed by the Security Council. As theultimate objective of such sanctions is to influence certainpolitical regimes to bring them into compliance with therules of international legality  it is therefore necessary thatall means under Chapter VI of the Charter be exhaustedbefore resorting to Chapter VII and its applications. Theclarity of the objective of imposing sanctions and athorough consideration of their consequences in the shortand long terms  including human suffering  are ofparamount importance.An excessive imposition of sanctions  or theirperpetuation without acceptable reason or a clear time-frame  will erode their credibility and the commitmentsmade to applying them. Therefore  there is a need forpatience  prudence and a determination of the time-frameof sanctions.I now turn to the Middle East  which is sufferingfrom numerous problems  some chronic and others fairlyrecent  which we hope will not also become chronic ones.I am referring here to the situation of Iraq  which mustreach its natural conclusion: the lifting of the sanctionsthrough implementation of the Security Council?sresolutions and in accordance with their provisions. Thisrequires goodwill  proper conduct and the establishmentof constructive and stable cooperation between Iraq andthe mechanisms of the Security Council. This is a sharedresponsibility  not the responsibility of one party alone.Needless to say  the elimination of weapons of massdestruction in Iraq is an integral part of their eliminationin the region as a whole  as was indeed reflected inSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991).I would also like to refer to the Lockerbie issue andexpress our satisfaction at the recent positive developmentof the situation by the consent of the parties to that yet-to-be settled dispute. This represents significant progresstowards the trial of the two suspects and establishing thetruth. We all hope that progress will be made  in goodfaith  as soon as possible within the framework of thecontacts made by the Secretary-General and that anagreement will be reached on the required procedures andguarantees. Thus  the whole matter will be put behind us the sanctions imposed on Libya will be lifted and a longoverdue end to a period of tension will come to pass.At another level  we believe that the region mustavoid anything that could add to its tensions: declarationsof strategic alliances that create discord and lead tocounter-alliances; sneaking into the nuclear club  whichwill lead to an arms race in the region  unless Israel  likeall other States of the region  accedes to the Non-Proliferation Treaty; the lack of a solution to the problemsand disputes of sovereignty  foremost among which is thequestion of the three islands of the United Arab Emiratesin the Gulf; and attempts at partitioning and jeopardizingthe unity and territorial integrity of States  as is the casewith Iraq and Sudan.As for the peace process  which is about to collapse the situation is indeed grave  not only because of thedeadlock it has reached  but also because the roots of the17problem go much deeper than that. The deadlock is relatedto the negative change in the policy of Israel  whichbelieves that the current international situation enables it toimpose its exaggerated demands on the Arab parties and toimpose an Israeli peace on the Middle East. This isprobably due to the belief which it has evolved  namely thatno person  no Government and no State would be able tostand in its way  pressure it or refuse its demands.We reject this policy  which uses securityconsiderations to justify occupation  thus stripping securityrequirements  which could be legitimate  of any meaning.Such requirements could have been negotiated andreasonable ones accepted on a reciprocal basis. Yet thevalidity  true weight and credibility of those Israeli securityrequirements have become dubious. Egypt  the first ArabState to establish peace with Israel and the largest one witha role in the Middle East and the Arab and Islamic worlds cannot accept such negative policies  which will drive theregion once more towards the flames of tension  conflictand instability.We have made peace with Israel. The Arab Stateshave moved towards the same objective on the basis ofSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967)  which is based onthe principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition ofterritory by force and on Israel?s right to live in peacewithin its borders — which are  of course  the borders andthe lines of June 1967 — as well as on the basis of theMadrid framework  namely  the principle of land for peace.With respect to the Palestinians  the Oslo accord providesfor significant Israeli withdrawals before the final statusnegotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian sides canbegin.At their summit meeting in Cairo in 1996  Arableaders at the highest level expressed the commitment ofArab States to the peace process  since Arab-Israeli peaceis a strategic objective to be achieved under internationallegality. But it requires a corresponding commitment fromIsrael to follow the road to peace in a manner that restoresthe rights and the occupied territories of the Palestiniansand ensures balanced and equal security to all the States ofthe region  in accordance with the principle of land forpeace.The Arab summit decided that any disruption by Israelof these principles and bases of the peace process; that anyreneging on the commitments it has made and agreementsreached on the same path; and that any procrastination intheir implementation will only set back the peace process.The attendant dangers and repercussions of such actionswould relaunch the region into the spiral of tension andcompel the Arab States to reconsider the steps they havetaken towards Israel within the framework of the peaceprocess. The Israeli Government alone would bear the fullresponsibility for such a development.Regrettably  it has become evident that the IsraeliGovernment is reneging on the commitments it hasundertaken in the context of the Security Council?sresolutions  the Madrid framework and the Oslo accord.This attitude logically compels us to take a forthright anddetermined opposition to Israel?s negative position  whichruns counter to the objective requirements for peace. Ifwe do not  the effective international action necessary todeal with this grave situation will not be forthcoming.We wonder what the Israeli Government reallywants. The Arabs have given it acceptance  coexistence peace and recognition. But it would seem that what theIsraeli Government really wants is all of the above  plusmost of the land and the privilege to disregard the rightsof the Palestinians. This is simply unacceptable. Peopleshave their dignity and the rights to their own land and toself-determination. No generation is entitled to cede suchrights. They are the rights of all generations — past present and future — throughout history.We reiterate that Israel must reconsider its positionand its policy. The international situation is everchanging. What may be imposed today without justice orbalance will disintegrate tomorrow. We want a stable enduring agreement. This can be achieved only once weagree on a comprehensive package that includes Israel?scomplete withdrawal from the territories of Syria Lebanon  the West Bank and Gaza in Palestine; theestablishment of a Palestinian State; an agreement on thefinal status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Palestinianrefugees; an agreement on security requirements  withoutundue exaggeration; the recognition of Israel as a State;and coexistence with it as a member of the family of theMiddle East  within the framework of normal relations. Irepeat that all this must constitute a package deal thatcannot be divided to serve the interests of one party at theexpense of the others.Does the Israeli Government recognize theimportance of justice and legitimacy? Does it realize thegrave and present danger of spurning this opportunity toachieve peace? Letting this historic opportunity slip awayand entering the next century with the file of the Arab-Israeli conflict still open will lead to tension andinstability not only in the Middle East  but in the18international community as a whole. Historical experiencehas proven that tension knows no boundaries  thatinstability cannot be confined to one specific region andthat international peace and security are indivisible.The international community must therefore raise itsvoice against the setback of the peace process and play itsrole in salvaging it. We are not calling for an internationaltrial. Rather  we ask the international community to play itsrole in safeguarding the bases of peace agreed uponunanimously in the Security Council and at the MadridConference  and in the consideration of the measuresnecessary to restore the process to its correct track and toavert the eruption of further crises in the future.It was in this spirit that Presidents Hosni Mubarak andJacques Chirac announced their initiative to convene aconference of States determined to save the peace. We mustemphasize that this Franco-Egyptian initiative does not aimat replacing or hampering any current positive efforts. Itaims  rather  at reinforcing these efforts and ensuring theirsuccess  particularly those of the United States  which wesupport as long as they seek balanced agreements.Egypt accords equal attention to issues of the Africancontinent. Today  we are faced with two urgent and seriousmatters. The first pertains to the Horn of Africa  namely the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. We stronglysupport the mediation efforts  led by the Chairman of theOrganization of African Unity  to arrive at a peacefulsolution and the continued cessation of military hostilities.In this way will normalcy be restored and peaceestablished.The second question is the situation in and around theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Here  the efforts madeby the leaders of Africa and the United Nations Secretary-General continue to be important. Such efforts preserve theunity and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo and establish positive relations between it and itsneighbours in the larger context of a cessation of militaryoperations and of interference in its internal affairs. Theyalso require the maintenance of its national unity withinrational democracy.The situation in Africa is being dangerouslyaggravated by these problems and by the continent?s gravesocio-economic situation. This requires special attention which we call on the international community and theUnited Nations to give.In conclusion  I must refer to the phenomenon ofglobalization. We must face its challenges and address itsnegative aspects  while maximizing its benefits. A numberof developing countries have successfully dealt withglobalization and achieved their necessary integration intothe world economy. At the same time  many developedcountries have adopted covert protectionist measures andnew conditionalities  such as environmental and labourstandards  and continue to maintain tariff barriers againstthe primary exports of the developing countries. Thesemeasures run counter to the equitable bases of the worldtrading system. This is an important issue which we mustaddress in the context of evaluating past achievementsand challenges  and of shaping a new international order.These are the questions which Egypt wished to putbefore this session as a modest contribution to shaping acommon vision that would inspire the march of humanityin the coming decades  during which we hope that justice equality  progress and prosperity will prevail."
"52",2170,"ERI",53,1998,"I wish to join those whohave spoken before me in congratulating Mr. Didier Operttion his election to the presidency of the fifty-third session ofthe General Assembly. His vast experience and skill assureus that he will guide the deliberations of the Assembly toa successful end. I assure him of the full support of mydelegation as he carries out his important mandate.Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko ofUkraine  for his outstanding leadership during his tenurelast session.The Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. KofiAnnan  deserves appreciation for his commendable effortsand for the effective leadership he has provided to ensurethe realization of the ideals of our Organization by makingthe United Nations more effective and better able to serveits Members.The end of the cold war  even if only briefly  raisedhopes and expectations and sent tidings of a more peaceful safer  just and fair world safeguarded from conflict andtension  hunger and disease. Such hopes and expectationswere to be frustrated rather early as the world was plungedin numerous conflicts between and with States  ethnicviolence and hatred  terrorism  gross violations of humanrights  racism and xenophobia  as well as mass starvationand an increase in the number of refugees and displacedpersons.The international community cannot dismiss or much less  ignore this situation  which in some cases hascaused the commission of serious international crimes  notonly because it is generally the innocent and the weak —women  children and the elderly — who are the firstvictims  but also because this situation  which now seemsto be limited to certain regions  may soon engulf widerareas of the world. In the face of these harsh realities  itis incumbent on the United Nations and the internationalcommunity to search for fresh  innovative approacheswith a view to eliminating the root causes of thissituation  in order to ensure respect for the basicprinciples of the Charter  to save the innocent from thescourge of terrorism and to protect the human and civilrights of ethnic minorities. If they fail to do so  it will notonly prolong the agony of the victims but will  in fact sooner or later  threaten regional as well as internationalpeace and security.The founding fathers of our Organization recognizedeconomic development as one of humanity’s inalienablerights  and set as one of the goals of the United Nationsthe promotion of social progress and better standards oflife in larger freedom. I am certain that all developingcountries would declare in no uncertain terms that thisgoal has so far been unattained.The situation in Africa is cause for serious concern.In spite of the great efforts exerted by regional andsubregional organizations and agencies  the situation inmany parts of the continent is deteriorating and becomingmore dangerous by the day. The tragic bloodshed andsuffering that Africans have witnessed in the recent pastin various parts of the continent are too horrible to recite.They must not recur and  where they continue to exist they must be stopped.In the Great Lakes region  conflicts are developingmuch wider ramifications  in spite of their seemingregional containment. They pose a grave threat to peaceand security  as they may soon involve extraregionalPowers. It is hoped that through ongoing regionalinitiatives it will be possible to formulate just andmutually acceptable solutions. In the Democratic Republicof the Congo  Africans and the rest of the world havebeen forced to witness the disheartening spectacle of an22African country which had barely emerged from the crueldestruction of a rapacious dictatorship being once againravaged by multifaceted fighting. This has also divided thebroad African coalition which had contributed to thepromotion of peace and security in that country. This sadstate of affairs must be quickly reversed on the basis of fullrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and a recognition thatthe internal political process is the sole prerogative of theCongolese people  and with awareness of the need for aregional framework of cooperation to address the securityconcerns of the countries of the region.Somalia and the Sudan continue to be sources ofanguish and sorrow for Africa  because there is still a lackof progress in the efforts to resolve the crises in bothcountries. The frustration of the international community atthe lack of progress in peacemaking in both countries isunderstandable. It must be noted  however  that genuineefforts continue to be made by the countries of theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)  andthe international community must not despair or give up but must contribute to the efforts of these countries if theyare to be successful. In this connection  my delegationupholds the view that with regard to the Sudan conflictIGAD’s Declaration of Principles and consequentresolutions remain the sound basis for a just and lastingsolution to the conflict.In my statement last year I declared that Eritrea’sforeign policy rested on two basic tenets. The first was thedeep conviction that where there is goodwill all disputescan be resolved through peaceful negotiations and methodswithout recourse to violence. The second tenet was theunswerving devotion of Eritrea to justice and equality. Ialso declared that these two tenets have influenced oursearch for friendship and cooperation with our neighbours as well as with other States. This statement is as validtoday as it was last year.The commitment of the Government of Eritrea tothese two tenets has helped to defuse conflict with theRepublic of Yemen and to arrive at a mutual understandingto resolve the dispute over the Eritrean archipelago ofHanish-Zukar in the Red Sea by peaceful means througharbitration.Today  too  the Government of Eritrea insists that theroad to peace with Ethiopia is by a strict application andenforcement of the principles of the Charters of the UnitedNations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  aswell as the OAU decision on colonial borders. Once again Eritrea calls upon the international community particularly the United Nations and the OAU  to ensurerespect for these principles and the decision.Eritrea was surprised and disturbed by the eruptionof conflict with Ethiopia because  in spite ofdisagreements on the issue of boundaries  dating back tothe days of armed struggle the Eritrean Government hadassumed and hoped that in view of the close relationsbetween the two countries  it was possible to arrive at anamicable and enduring solution.The responsibility for the escalation of the disputerests solely with the Government of Ethiopia  which hasfor a long period of time consistently violated thesovereignty and territorial integrity of Eritrea  resulting inthe occupation of large tracts of Eritrean territory followed by the forced displacement of Eritrean peasantsand the replacement of Eritrean administrative structuresby Ethiopian institutions. It reached a climax on 6 Mayonly as a result of the further unprovoked incursions bymembers of the Ethiopian armed forces  which attackedEritrean troops in the Badme region  in south-westernEritrea. These incursions were premeditated andmeticulously planned. This is the root cause of thedispute.For a long time Eritreans had opted for patient andquiet diplomacy. They had hoped against hope that theperiodic incursions were only the petty acts of somemiscreant and ill-advised regional officials. It was only ata very late stage — and particularly after the publicationin 1997 of an official map of the Tigray administrativezone incorporating additional indisputably Eritreanterritory and after the issuance of the new Ethiopiancurrency note depicting the same map — that theyrealized the full meaning of the Ethiopian adventure. Yet even in the aftermath of the fighting that was triggered bythe unprovoked Ethiopian incursion and attacks onEritrean troops  Eritrea never crossed its internationallyrecognized border; but Ethiopia still controls otherEritrean territory in south-western Eritrea.In spite of all this evidence of its aggressive deeds the Ethiopian Government is conducting an absurdpropaganda campaign to portray Eritrea as awarmongering nation which has committed aggressionagainst  and occupies  Ethiopian territory. Nothing couldbe further from the truth. At no time have Eritrean troopscrossed Eritrea’s internationally recognized borders aseverybody can see. On the contrary  it was Ethiopiantroops that invaded Eritrea after Prime Minister Meles23Zenawi’s declaration of war on 13 May 1998. They wererepulsed. It is important to note that the Deputy ForeignMinister of Ethiopia  Dr. Tekeda Alemu  had articulatedEthiopia’s expansionist designs by publicly declaring in aspeech to members of the Ethiopian community in theUnited States that Ethiopia would occupy the Eritrean portof Assab within a short time. In the light of the above Ethiopia’s claims that it is the victim of aggression and willnot negotiate unless Eritrea withdraws from “its territory”are obviously false and only meant to hoodwink theinternational community and to cover up its own acts ofaggression.Even today  Ethiopia is threatening war unless Eritreawithdraws unconditionally from territories which are fullywithin its internationally recognized borders. Todayvirtually the whole of the Ethiopian army has takenpositions along the Eritrean border  and almost all of thehighest leaders of Ethiopia  including the President  thePrime Minister  the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister ofDefence  the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces  thePresident of the Tigray region and a Senior Official of theTPLF have publicly declared in just the past few days thatEthiopia has finalized war preparations and will soon teachEritreans lessons they will never forget.It is regrettable  therefore  that all the goodwill andefforts of the Eritrean Government  consisting of severalconstructive proposals  to bring about a peaceful and legalsettlement of the present border dispute with Ethiopia  onthe basis of the OAU resolution on colonial borders  havebeen consistently rejected by the Ethiopian Government which obdurately pursues a policy which is committed tothe settlement of matters by military means. The EthiopianGovernment has also rejected all overtures by third partiesfor a peaceful solution of the dispute and all calls made bythe international community to seek a peaceful solution.This expansionist and aggressive policy is underscoredby the use or threat of force  as well as a massive andmalicious propaganda campaign against Eritrea. Thepropaganda campaign accents ethnic hatred and vituperationagainst and slander of the Eritrean people and members ofthe Eritrean Government. It also calls upon the Eritreanpeople to rise up against their Government.At the same time  the Ethiopian Government has beensystematically and wilfully violating the most sacred andcherished provisions of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  the two International Covenants and several otherinternational human rights instruments  as well as theprinciples enshrined in the United Nations and OAUCharters  by deporting or expelling more than 20 000Eritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin underextremely unhealthy conditions or dumping them in verydangerous places  and by deliberately separating familymembers  exposing them to inhuman  cruel and degradingtreatment and confiscating their property. These acts havebeen well documented by third parties  including membersof United Nations agencies  heads of mission of memberStates of the European Union and several non-governmental organizations.Yet the Ethiopian Government  in an amazinglyrefined application of the Orwellian principle  accuses theEritrean Government of precisely the outrages andatrocities it itself has been committing against Eritreansand Ethiopians of Eritrean origin. The truth is that theEritrean Government has not detained  expelled  deportedor otherwise violated the rights — human or otherwise —of Ethiopians living in Eritrea. This has been verified bylegitimate third parties like representatives of theEuropean Union  United Nations agencies and theInternational Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Asusual  the Ethiopian Government has called all of themliars. We have hitherto extended an invitation to allinterested parties to carry out an on-the-spot verificationof the human rights conditions in both Eritrea andEthiopia. We now extend this invitation to members ofthe Assembly. We also would like them to receive asimilar invitation from the Ethiopian Government.This dispute is about borders  pure and simple. Anyeffort to transmute it into anything else must be viewedas only a vain and brazen attempt by the EthiopianGovernment to camouflage its aggression and itsexpansionist policies. In this connection  it must be madeclear that it was the Ethiopian Government which wilfullyviolated Eritrea’s colonial boundaries and forcefullyoccupied those areas that it had incorporated into its newmap of Tigray. It was the Ethiopian Government whichsubverted all Eritrean efforts to defuse the crisis and tofind a peaceful bilateral solution through their JointBorder Commission by unleashing unprovoked militaryattacks on Eritrea from 6 to 12 May. It was the EthiopianGovernment which declared war on Eritrea by aresolution of its Parliament on 13 May. It was theGovernment of Ethiopia which invaded Eritrea alongseveral points on their common border. It was theGovernment of Ethiopia which launched an air strike onAsmara  the Eritrean capital  on 5 June 1998. It was theEthiopian Government which imposed an air and seablockade by threatening indiscriminate air bombing ofEritrea.24Yet Ethiopia has falsely portrayed Eritrea as anaggressor country by claiming that Eritrean forces invadedEthiopian territory on 12 May. However  it is not claimsand counter-claims that matter. There is incontrovertiblematerial evidence which establishes that Ethiopia hasdeliberately used force and carried out military incursionsin Eritrea since July 1997 with a view to covertly changingthe reality on the ground. In this connection  I wish to bringto the Assembly’s attention that the Eritrean Governmenthas repeatedly called for an independent investigation of theincidents that triggered the conflict.This border dispute should not have existed in the firstplace  considering that boundaries between the two Statesare some of the most clearly defined in Africa and weremade by explicit and detailed provisions of internationaltreaties. They were then confirmed by the United Nationswhen it created the ill-fated Eritrean-Ethiopian federation and again clearly defined in the Constitution that the UnitedNations gave to Eritrea.True  the borders may not have been demarcated; butthey are not the only undemarcated borders in Africa  andthe non-demarcation of boundaries has not prevented mostAfrican — and indeed other — States from living in peacewith their neighbours and from solving their problemspeacefully.Eritrea is committed to a peaceful and legal solutionof this dispute on the basis of the principles of sovereigntyand territorial integrity of States which are enshrined in thecharters of both the United Nations and the OAU as well asthe decisions and declarations of the OAU and the Non-Aligned Movement. Since before the onset of the crisis Eritrea has been attempting to initiate numerous bilateraldiscussions with Ethiopia with a view to addressing alloutstanding issues related to their common borders. In thisconnection  the following must be mentioned.First  the Eritrean Cabinet and National Assemblyissued orders  on 14 and 20 May 1998 and again on 18June 1998  respectively  for the temporary demilitarizationof the areas of dispute.Secondly  the Eritrean President sent two letters to thePrime Minister of Ethiopia requesting him to join him indefusing the dispute and settling the border issue peacefullyand legally on a bilateral basis.Thirdly  the Eritrean Government presented to theOAU Committee of Ambassadors a proposal containing theprinciples of respect of colonial boundaries and non-violation of these borders; respect of the charters of theOAU and the United Nations; commitment not to useforce to impose a solution; commitment to peaceful andlegal means to solve the dispute; readiness to stop allhostilities; and readiness to enter into direct talks withoutpreconditions.Unfortunately  all our efforts failed because ofnegative responses from Ethiopia. On the other hand Ethiopia has yet to offer a single plan or peace proposal.It has only threatened war unless Eritrea withdraws fromterritories which are within the internationally recognizedborders of Eritrea. In this connection  it must bementioned that the Eritrean Government has time andagain requested the Ethiopian Government to publiclyannounce to the peoples of Eritrea  Ethiopia and theinternational community the territories that it claims andto designate them on a political map with cleargeographical coordinates.It is for these reasons that the Government of Eritreayet again offers the following as a basis for the solutionof the dispute.First  the comprehensive solution of the problemthrough a technical demarcation on the basis of theestablished colonial treaties that clearly define theboundary between the two countries.Secondly  a possible resort to arbitration on the basisof the sanctity of colonial borders in the event that this isdemanded by the other party.Pending a lasting  legal solution  an immediatecessation of all hostilities and a ceasefire to be monitoredby an observer force under the auspices of the UnitedNations.It is a matter of satisfaction to the people andGovernment of Eritrea that numerous governmentalinstitutions  international and regional organizations andnon-governmental organizations  including the House ofRepresentatives of the United States Congress  theEuropean Union and the Non-Aligned Movement  have in welcoming the Eritrean initiative  called upon bothEritrea and Ethiopia to avoid the use of force at all costsand to resolve their disputes peacefully.I wish to declare here and now  in loud and clearterms  that the Government of Eritrea welcomes  and isready to undertake to implement  a decision by theAssembly which provides without any preconditions forthe cessation of hostilities  a ceasefire agreement and a25peaceful resolution of the dispute by any method as theonly acceptable solution.In Africa  conflicts such as the present Eritrean-Ethiopian border dispute have taken place several times inthe past. Each one of these conflicts was addressed on thebasis of the hallowed principles and decisions of the OAU including in particular respect for colonial borders  thesovereignty and territorial integrity of States and the non-use of force or threat of force.As the OAU prepares itself to enter the twenty-firstcentury  it is imperative that its member States rededicatethemselves to the sublime principles and resolutions thathave hitherto served our continent. These principles anddecisions  which have successfully fostered peace andstability  solved conflicts and defused tension in ourcontinent in the past  will be as valid in the future as theyhave been since they were first articulated. Only throughtheir proper application will it be possible to defusetension and eliminate conflict.Eritrea reiterates its commitment to peace  harmonyand the rule of law in international relations  howeverpainful this tragedy may be. Eritrea seeks peace for itselfand for all of its neighbours. Eritrea will continue to seekgood relations with all its neighbours.Eritrea is in a race against the clock of developmentand cannot afford to lose the time  energy and resourceswhich must be used in the war against underdevelopment.To date  Eritrea has restrained itself against extremeprovocation  and it will continue to do so unless it isforced to defend itself. If aggression is committed againsttheir country  however  Eritreans will have no choice butto defend their hard-won independence and sovereignty aswell as every inch of their territory with whatever is attheir disposal."
"53",2216,"ESP",53,1998,"Allow me first  Mr. President  to offer you my sincerestcongratulations on your appointment  and to express mysatisfaction that the work of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session will be led by such a distinguishedrepresentative of a country with which Spain has excellentrelations. I should also like to thank Minister Udovenko forthe efficiency with which he presided over the GeneralAssembly during the previous session.The Foreign Minister of Austria has already set outthe main elements of the European Union?s position in theUnited Nations. For my part  I should like to highlightcertain issues of particular interest to Spain.It can generally be said that our Organization is todayin a stronger position than in previous years  which werecharacterized by a predominant feeling of crisis. The majorreforms undertaken will enable the United Nations tocontinue to be the main forum for international cooperation.Dialogue  the promotion of respect for human rights and thedevelopment of international life will continue under theauspices of the United Nations. Furthermore  theOrganization has consolidated its primary function ofmaintaining international peace and security.An essential element of the strengthening process thatthe United Nations is currently undergoing is greaterrecognition of the limits that restrict its action. The processof reforming the Organization  which the Secretary-Generalhas set in motion with decisiveness and determination  hascontributed significantly to a sense of getting theOrganization under control and of renewed confidence in itspossibilities. Spain will follow this process very closely soas to support it and ensure that it is brought to asuccessful conclusion.The debate on enlarging the membership of theSecurity Council deserves separate consideration. Thedifficulties posed by enlarging the permanent membershiphave been confirmed as negotiations have proceeded. Wemust not attempt to force decisions that might createdivisions within certain regional groups. Reform mustreflect  as far as possible  general agreement between theMembers of the Organization  and in any case it mustrespect the provisions of Article 108 of the Charter. Wemust therefore acknowledge that at present there is norealistic alternative to increasing only the number of non-permanent members.In order for our Organization to be able to performsatisfactorily its indispensable work  it must be endowedwith sufficient funds. The Secretary-General is carryingout a major reform designed to ensure  among other aims better use of the financial means made available to it byStates. However  the current financial situation is veryworrying  largely owing to the accumulation of arrears.No State should forget that full and timely payment of itscontributions is a legally binding international obligation.In 1999  my country will become the eighth largestcontributor to the Organization?s budget. We are fullyaware of the responsibility this entails and are ready toassume it.With the International Decade for the Eradication ofColonialism about to end  I believe it is important torecall that the historic work carried out by theOrganization in this field cannot be considered completeas long as there remain colonial situations such as the onewhich so painfully affects my country. I am referring  ofcourse  to the question of Gibraltar.Every year the General Assembly renews its appealsto Spain and the United Kingdom to continue theirnegotiations with a view to putting an end to the colonialsituation of Gibraltar. The current negotiation processstems from the so-called Brussels declaration of 1984  inwhich the Governments of our two States undertook toestablish a negotiation process  to include sovereigntyissues  in order to settle all their differences. During the1997 negotiating round I submitted a proposal that wouldallow Spain to regain sovereignty over Gibraltar  whilemaintaining for the inhabitants of the Territory all theircurrent benefits  granting them  in the framework of theSpanish State  a greater degree of political autonomy thanthey enjoy today  and agreeing  as an additional guarantee26of Spain?s good faith  to share sovereignty with the UnitedKingdom for a long transition period.I believe that that proposal should be able to form thebasis of an agreement that would  once and for all  put anend to an anachronistic situation originating from thedynastic wars of the early eighteenth century.Respect for human rights is essential in guaranteeingthe maintenance of international peace and security. OurOrganization also plays a prominent role in this field.The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of theadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsshould provide a powerful incentive to continue to developinternational instruments for protecting human rights. Theadoption of the statute of the International Criminal Courtduring the recent Rome Conference marked a verysignificant step in that direction. Spain firmly supported theadoption of the statute  signed it on the first day  and isprepared to carry out any actions needed to ensure itsprompt entry into force.Likewise  I wish to back the important workperformed by the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights  and to underline the importance that mycountry attaches to the work of the Commission on HumanRights  to which it has presented its candidature for theperiod 2000 to 2002.Terrorism constitutes a serious threat to domestic andinternational security  to the development and functioningof democratic institutions throughout the world and to theexercise of human rights. Spain firmly believes instrengthening the machinery of international cooperation for which the United Nations is a key forum. Spain  whichhas ratified all conventions adopted on this issue  hasalready signed the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings and hopes that  as thenext step  a convention for the suppression of acts ofnuclear terrorism can be adopted.Similarly  Spain gives high priority to the internationalfight against drugs. This was evidenced by the SpanishPrime Minister?s attendance at the special session of theGeneral Assembly in June  which was devoted to thisuniversal problem and which contributed substantially toreaffirming our conviction that it is critical to consolidateinternational coordination in seeking global solutions basedon the principles of shared responsibility  attention tosustainable development and boosting regional andinterregional cooperation.Multilateral development cooperation and povertyeradication are crucial to the establishment of peacefulinternational coexistence based on respect for humanrights. Spain is following with attention theimplementation of the reform measures proposed by theSecretary-General. My Government praises themomentum the Secretary-General is giving to the reformof the environmental and human settlement sectorsdirectly linked to development. My country isparticipating in studying new financing formulas toprovide sufficient resources for development cooperation.In this regard  without losing sight of the unavoidabledebate on budgetary matters  Spain will consider apossible gradual increase in its voluntary contributionsover the next few years.On the subject of disarmament  Spain will shortlyratify the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of theUse  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction; it is pleasedwith the swift pace of ratification of the Convention. It islikewise of the utmost importance that next year weshould succeed in concluding negotiations on a protocolon verification of biological weapons.As regards nuclear weapons  I cannot but expressonce again my concern at the nuclear tests conducted byIndia and Pakistan  which go against the internationalcommunity?s efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation.Nevertheless  we are optimistic about the forthcomingcommencement of negotiations on a treaty banning theproduction of fissile materials for the manufacture ofnuclear weapons. Finally  we are confident that thisprogress can be further enhanced by India?s andPakistan?s accession to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.The chief aim of our Organization continues to bethe maintenance of international peace and security. Herethe United Nations increasingly uses the means thatregional organizations or groups of States place at itsdisposal. As a result  its response to various crises isbecoming more flexible and the legitimizing role of theUnited Nations now carries more weight. Some goodexamples  in addition to the Stabilization Force (SFOR)and Operation Alba — to cite two cases in which Spainrespectively continues to play and played a particularlyprominent role — are initiatives such as the Stand-byForces High-Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG)  which can27speed up United Nations intervention considerably  and inwhich Spain is also beginning to participate. Moreover  themediation capacity of the Secretary-General and hisrepresentatives has been enhanced even further over thepast year.In this connection  I wish to reaffirm my country?scommitment to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  in the service of which 2 000 Spaniards arecurrently serving. Indeed  in addition to participating inSFOR  the International Police Task Force (IPTF) and theUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala(MINUGUA)  Spain this year sent a police contingent tothe United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA).Furthermore  Spain intends to sign soon a memorandum ofunderstanding with the Secretariat to define the modalitiesfor making stand-by forces available to the Organization.Humanitarian assistance operations have come to playan increasingly important role. Aid workers from manycountries  including Spain  have lost their lives in thesemissions. For this reason  my country will continue topromote all measures that can help improve the securityand safety of personnel providing humanitarian assistance.The ongoing process of globalization does not meanthe disappearance of the diversity of civilizations andcultures  which coexist with increasing closeness. To thecontrary  this diversity itself constitutes a value which mustbe used to promote solidarity and cooperation amongnations. Indeed  serious crises — some of which I shallmention in this statement — continue to afflict theinternational community; unfortunately too  our ability totake action is still often limited.The situation in Africa is cause for serious concern and justifies the special consideration our Organization isgiving to African crises. Suffice it to mention the armedconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the tragichumanitarian crisis in Sudan — in the solution of whichSpain is making a special effort to cooperate  the precarioussituation of Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau  and theextremely serious exacerbation of tension in Angola  whereUNITA must respect the Lusaka agreements and where theUnited Nations must continue to give its most valuablesupport to the peace process.In Western Sahara  the parties must continue todemonstrate their good will so that the referendum on self-determination envisaged in the Secretary-General?ssettlement plan can be held. The coming months willundoubtedly be crucial. Spain will continue to back theSecretary-General  his representatives and the UnitedNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara(MINURSO).The situation in Kosovo is also extremely serious.Spain backs the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia  butPresident Milosevic´ and his Government must understandthat the international community will not remainimpassive in the face of an indiscriminate use of forcethat is creating a very serious humanitarian problem. Asincere negotiation process should be established as soonas possible to enable Kosovo to regain the necessarypolitical autonomy in Yugoslavia.In Latin America  the reconciliation process inGuatemala continues to make good headway  despitesome tragic incidents  and is an inspiring example. Weare confident that the ongoing talks in Colombia will leadto a process of national reconciliation  an objective towhich Spain has been giving its fullest support.As regards the peace process in the Middle East Spain is deeply concerned about the current standstill andactively backs the different initiatives presented particularly the European Union proposals  to safeguardthis process and implement the commitments alreadymade by the parties. There is an urgent need to put anend to this conflict  which has already lasted too long; itimplies a threat to stability  fundamentally in theMediterranean  but with global repercussions. We mustfind a solution to achieve a long-lasting reconciliation ofthe Jewish  Christian and Islamic cultures. Spain is  to agreat extent  an example of such reconciliation  and westand ready to make all necessary efforts to achieve thisgoal.Lastly  in Asia  Spain is following with greatconcern the situation in Afghanistan. In another context it is confident that the parties will succeed in reaching anagreement to form a Government in Cambodia after therecent elections.I firmly believe that  after a period of excessive andunjustified hopes and consequent disappointments  now isthe time for the United Nations to forge determinedlyahead in fostering an international coexistence based onrespect for human rights  justice and solidarity.Nonetheless  this will only be possible if it has the fullsupport of all of us. Spain hereby reiterates its fullestcommitment to the United Nations.28"
"54",2242,"EST",53,1998,"Please allow me to extend toyou  Sir  my delegation?s sincere congratulations on yourelection to preside over the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly. I wish you all the best in carrying outyour duties. Let me also express my appreciation for hisexcellent work to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  the President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-second session.As of today 462 days remain until the end of thiscentury — a century which has recorded many phases inthe development of the world. There have been times ofconfrontation and times of partnership  times ofprotectiveness and times of openness.Seven years ago the walls of separation between thenations of East and West were torn down  creatingopportunities for closer cooperation and economicintegration. This also opened doors for nations to promotegeneral welfare  mutual understanding and respect and thebuilding of trust and confidence in one another.As has been said about this moment in history  it isnot so much that the borders between States are now openand can be freely crossed  but that they can be transcended.Distances and borders now have limited significance; theglobe has become a universal village in its own right.Today  the world economy appears to be sliding intoa deep crisis. The countries that are suffering the most arethe poorest. While I realize that globalization entails risksand challenges for economies and societies  I am convincedthat there is no alternative. The only credible formula for aviable global economy is the promotion of freer tradethrough the abolition of trade barriers and the pursuit ofsustained economic and democratic reform. Once startingon this path of reform  as difficult as it may be  there canbe no stepping aside for shortsighted political consideration.Estonia?s success is living proof of this.Along with many other States  Estonia began itstransition from a Communist regime to democracy andfrom a State-controlled economy to a free market in 1991.By 1997  Estonia had the highest economic growth rate inEurope  and preliminary figures for 1998 indicate thatgrowth continues to be strong. Estonia?s inclusion amongthe six countries to begin accession negotiations with theEuropean Union is a recognition of its achievements inbuilding a civil society and a well-functioning marketeconomy.In my country  we are proud of the European Unioninvitation. We regard the European integration process asamong the most challenging yet most rewardingendeavours for our continent  today and in the distantfuture. European integration is not simply an effort toprovide our citizens with the tools for success in aglobalizing world; it is also a catalyst for greater opennessthroughout the continent. We are convinced that pursuingmembership is in itself a strong guarantee for stabledevelopment  as it provides all applicants with a viableroad map to reform.Estonia greatly appreciates the help provided by theUnited Nations  other international organizations and anumber of bilateral donors during the difficult early yearsof transition. Now that Estonia has entered into the post-transitional stage of its development  we believe it is timeto start paying back. During the last eight years ourGovernment and people have accumulated a wealth ofexperience and know-how on transition to a marketdemocracy. We want to share this knowledge withcountries at an early stage of their reforms  starting frombuilding up a well-functioning border guard and finishingwith successful monetary reform. Learning how to teachand provide support is the final lesson before graduation and this should be the goal of every reform country.At any one time  there are 15 or 16 armed conflictsfrom around the world on the Security Council?s agenda.Conflicts between and within States spread from Europeto Africa  from the Middle East to Asia. These conflictsare often driven by poor socio-economic conditions orethnic nationalism. Estonia  recognizing the primary roleof the United Nations in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  supports efforts to maintain andstrengthen the Organization?s capacity to organize andeffectively conduct its peacekeeping operations. Inaddition  we trust that the phasing out of gratis personnel as mandated by the General Assembly  if handledproperly  will not adversely affect the functioning of theDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations.As a contributor of personnel  Estonia is committedto continuous participation in United Nationspeacekeeping operations. We are preparing to dispatch thejoint Estonian- Latvian-Lithuanian battalion known asBALTBAT for its inaugural tour of duty in the nearfuture. I would like to extend our thanks to all nationswhich have supported the establishment and formation ofBALTBAT.Estonia also intends to continue its involvement inBosnia and Herzegovina within the United NationsInternational Police Task Force (IPTF). As a conflict31prevention measure  it welcomes and supports the enhancedcooperation of the United Nations with regionalorganizations or arrangements. In particular  deepercooperation with the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) has great potential.This year has already provided the internationalcommunity with a number of landmark events. Amongnotable achievements were the twentieth special session on the reduction and prevention of the illicit production sale and demand of narcotic substances  and the adoptionof the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Estoniatrusts that this fifty-third session of the General Assemblywill reinforce the momentum captured in June and July inboth New York and Rome  respectively.On the other hand  the world community haswitnessed a number of vicious terrorist attacks. It is timefor everybody to understand a basic fact: terrorism is notpolitics; it is not religion — it is murder. Estonia deploresall terrorist activities wherever they occur  whatever theform or manifestation. We sympathize with all nationsthat have suffered these acts and call for even strongersolidarity to fight against such attacks.We also must acknowledge that even on the eve ofthe fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  one of the majoraccomplishments of our Organization  the world is stillhome to gross violations of human rights on all sixcontinents. We therefore call for a sustained effort of theGeneral Assembly  in close cooperation with regionalorganizations  to address this issue and to find the mosteffective mechanisms for early warning to identify andstop these violations.Finally  a few words concerning the United Nationsreform. We support reform based on the proposals by theSecretary-General. Estonia strongly believes that the aimof this reform must be to come to grips with a changingworld as well as the principle of cost-effectiveness."
"55",2288,"ETH",53,1998,"I should like first of all toextend to Mr. Didier Opertti the Ethiopian delegation’scongratulations on his well-deserved unanimous electionto preside over the fifty-third session of the GeneralAssembly. We are fully confident that under his guidancethe work of this session of the General Assembly willmeet with resounding success.I should like also to express our appreciation to theoutgoing President for the most effective guidance heprovided to the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly and for the most valuable contribution he hasmade in this regard.We are indeed deeply indebted to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who has tried to inject newvitality into the United Nations and who has  underdifficult circumstances  continued to make a difference atthe helm of the Organization. We appreciate very deeplyin particular what the Secretary-General has been doingto ensure that the voices of all those whose viewpointsneeded to be heard are heard  and that there is a moreeffective cooperation between the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity (OAU).I wish in this regard to commend him with greatsatisfaction for what can only be called the historic reporthe has submitted on the causes of conflict and thepromotion of durable peace and sustainable developmentin Africa. This report  on which the Secretary-General hasdeservedly already been congratulated by many  raises allthose issues which are vital for the future of Africa andtreats them with such frankness and transparency that Ican only hope that we will all have the necessary resolveand commitment to follow up its recommendations andensure their implementation.We in Africa have made  over the past few years tremendous efforts to change Africa’s image and reality.Despite the apparent slips of the past few months  what9has been achieved on our continent since the early 1990sshould not be underestimated. This applies both to activitiesin the economic area as well as to the work for peace andstability on our continent.The past few years have demonstrated quite vividlyhow most African countries  including my own  Ethiopia have shown the necessary determination to create adomestic climate conducive to economic growth anddevelopment. There is today hardly any country in Africawhich has not acknowledged that the economic future ofcountries lies in market-based and private-sector-driveneconomic transformation and which has not taken theappropriate steps to that end. It is indeed gratifying to notethat the results  certainly in my own country  have beenencouraging.However  it is hardly disputable that our performancein the economic area has not by any means measured up toour expectations and that it has been far below what isneeded to prevent hopelessness and despair on ourcontinent  especially among the younger generation.Although the reasons that provide part of the explanationfor this may not be wanting  it is nonetheless very obviousthat the well-known limitations we face in internationaleconomic cooperation  in particular in the area of trade andin connection with the debt burden  constitute the majorimpediments to Africa’s economic regeneration.Consequently  the Secretary-General has reiterated in hisreport that there is indeed an urgent need for political willto ensure sustainable growth and development in Africa  notonly on our part as Africans but also on the part of theinternational community as a whole.In the past few years we in Africa have also madeevery effort  in particular through subregional organizations to work for peace and to prevent and contain conflicts. Inthis regard  the establishment by the OAU of a Mechanismfor Conflict Prevention  Management and Resolution inAfrica has been a major step we have taken  and ourachievement on this score over the past few years shouldnot be underestimated.In our own subregion  we have continued to exert thenecessary efforts for peace in the Sudan and to assist thepeople of Somalia in achieving national reconciliation andestablish a broad-based Government and a central authority.In both cases  while success has not been easily won  theefforts we are making have nonetheless continued becauseof the conviction  including on the part of our partners inthe international community  that there is no effectivealternative to these efforts carried out at the subregionallevel through the mechanism of the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development (IGAD).But it is very clear that the gains  however small made over the past few years in the area of peace andsecurity in Africa have been tested very severely in thepast few months. Developments in the Great Lakesregion  most particularly in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  represent some of the serious sources ofconcern we have in this regard. Nevertheless  we remainhopeful that a way out of this looming danger in theGreat Lakes region will be found based on full respect forthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries ofthe region  including the Democratic Republic of theCongo  and on the full recognition of the securityconcerns of all countries of the region.It is Ethiopia’s firm conviction that there is noalternative as a guarantee for peace and amity amongStates to the scrupulous observance of all of the principlesof international law governing inter-State relations.However  the greatest danger for peace in thisconnection is not so much the violation of internationallaw per se  but the response by the internationalcommunity in the face of such violation. When theinternational community  for whatever reason  fails torespond to aggression and to violations of internationallaw with the required indignation and resolve  thenaggressors are sent  wittingly or unwittingly  the messagethat the principles of international law are not there tounderpin the peace and that laws are there to be violatedwith impunity.This has been the lesson that we have drawn fromone of the major recent disappointments that we have hadin the area of peace and security in Africa. I am  ofcourse  referring here to the naked aggression by the Stateof Eritrea against Ethiopia on 12 May 1998. Despite theefforts by various parties  this aggression continues toportend the outbreak of a full-scale war between the twocountries because  on the one hand  of Eritrea’sintransigence in insisting that the peaceful resolution ofthe crisis must be linked to Ethiopia’s acceptance of theloss of its sovereignty over a part of its territory and tothe consequent appeasement of Eritrea  and  on the other of the dangerous impression the international communityis conveying: that aggression entails not costs to theaggressor  but rewards.The aggression committed by the Eritrean regimeagainst Ethiopia is unprecedented in more ways than one.10First  it is aggression that was not only unprovoked but wasalso carried out against a State that  until the day of theaggression  was a true friend of Eritrea — probably theonly true friend Eritrea had until that day of infamy whenit decided to stab Ethiopia in the back. Secondly  this is anaggression that  paradoxical as it may seem  was designedto impose Eritrea’s will and policy on a country that is inno shape or form suited to play second fiddle to Eritrea. Itis quite possible that Ethiopia’s preoccupation withdevelopment and with the fight against poverty over thepast several years might have created the wrong impressionin the minds of Eritrea’s leaders  with their fixation onmuscle-flexing and military might.Conscious of its responsibility not only for its ownpeople but also for peace and the image of our subregion Ethiopia has exerted and continues to exert the maximumpossible effort to ensure the peaceful resolution of thiscrisis  which was created solely by the Eritrean aggressionagainst Ethiopia and the subsequent occupation of Ethiopianterritory. Our full cooperation with the various efforts madein this regard — ranging from the United States-Rwandanfacilitation to the ongoing effort by the Organization ofAfrican Unity — attests to the maximum amount of self-restraint that Ethiopia has demonstrated under difficultcircumstances and in the complete absence of a rational andreasonable partner for peace on the part of Eritrea since theearly days of the aggression.The origin of the crisis between Ethiopia and Eritreais not in any bilateral dispute between the two countries;rather it is the result of aggression — an unprovokedaggression which constitutes a flagrant violation ofinternational law. To many this Eritrean aggression againstEthiopia has been incomprehensible. But to those who  likeus  are familiar with the internal Eritrean situation  thebehaviour of the Eritrean Government stems directly fromthe total absence in Eritrea of the normal characteristics ofa State. The absolute failure of institutions  the absence ofthe rule of law and the lack of accountability can explainthe aggressive behaviour of the Eritrean leadership towardsits neighbours ever since the establishment of Eritrea as anindependent State. As a result  these factors also constitutethe single most important cause for the current crisisbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea.The fact that aggression was committed againstEthiopia by Eritrea has been indisputable for some timenow. This has been the position and conclusion of all thosewho have so far tried  under the difficult circumstancesposed by Eritrea’s obduracy and lack of civility  to maketheir good offices available as facilitators and as brokers ofpeace in this conflict. No one who has been intimatelyinvolved with these various efforts for peace betweenEthiopia and Eritrea would fail to see that Eritrea hasnever  ever been prepared to give peace a chance. No onewho has been close to the efforts made so far to resolvethe crisis peacefully would fail to have noted not only theabsolute disregard for peace on the part of the Eritreanauthorities  but also their attempt to conceal the truth their lack of transparency and their sheer failure todemonstrate the minimum decency towards all those whohave tried to help. Nevertheless  it is indeed regrettablethat some  jettisoning their principles  seem to have drawnthe conclusion that  in the face of the known irrationalitybordering on the insane in Eritrea  what needs to be doneis to lean on Ethiopia  the victim of the aggression  tocompromise on principles and to agree to theappeasement of the aggressor and to reward aggression.Two things must not be overlooked by theinternational community with regard to the enormousimplications of Eritrea’s aggression against Ethiopia forinternational law and for the future of peace and stabilityin our subregion. First  it must be recognized that this isprecisely a trap laid by the Eritrean authorities in the formof a deliberately designed game of chicken  calculated these authorities hope  to end with rewarding aggression.Needless to say  Ethiopia refuses to play according to theEritrean script  and we call upon the internationalcommunity to take the same resolute stand.Secondly  it should never be assumed that throughappeasement war would be averted and that durable peacecan be ensured in our part of the world. Although becauseof its recent history this part of the world admittedlyneeds peace most  it cannot be expected to pay any priceto avoid war  in particular by accommodating aggressors.Clearly it stands to reason  and history has amplydemonstrated  that war in the long run cannot be avertedby appeasing aggressors.It is a total illusion to believe that Eritrea will betamed  and we are saying this from experience. One justhas to look at Eritrea’s track record of the past few yearsin our area. Eritrea’s propensity to aggression manifesteditself first in its belligerent attitude towards its neighboursover the past seven years and has culminated in its mostextreme form of aggression against Ethiopia. In the faceof such a destructive attitude one may ask why suchbelligerence by Eritrea was tolerated for so long. Theanswer is that  since we believed that the transition fromleading a liberation movement to running an independentState would take time  we somehow entertained the hope11that the Eritrean leadership would mature over time  as isthe case in almost all other similar circumstances. But ourhopes were finally dashed on 12 May 1998. In light of this we have absolutely no doubt that  if we fail to tell theEritrean authorities in no uncertain terms that their unrulybehaviour cannot be tolerated any longer  the result will beeven greater instability and interminable conflict in thesubregion  and it will have enormous implications for peaceand stability in our continent.That is why the Ethiopian Government and peoplefirmly believe that this flagrant violation of internationallaw by a small nation that is totally blinded by arroganceand led astray by a leadership that has concluded thatbrinkmanship will always pay should not be leftunchallenged. On our part  whether the internationalcommunity stands with us or not on the fundamentalprinciple of preserving international law and resistingaggression  regardless of the consequences  we are preparedto stand alone  if need be on principle as well as for ournational dignity.This  as we all remember  would not be the first timefor Ethiopia to be in such a situation. In this connection one is reminded of Emperor Haile Selassie and the Leagueof Nations following Italian aggression against Ethiopia in1936. The measure proposed at the time against Italy wasthe imposition of an oil embargo  which certainly wouldhave been effective in crippling Italian aggression againstEthiopia. Nevertheless  since appeasing Fascist Italy wasthe preferred option for the great Powers of the time  theproposal was rejected. Instead  in a clear demonstration ofinjustice unprecedented in the history of inter-Stateconflicts  an arms embargo was imposed by the League onboth the aggressor  Italy  and the victim of aggression Ethiopia.As a result we all know  as history has recorded  thisdismal failure of the League of Nations to preventaggression was one of the causes which brought about thedemise of the organization and later contributed to theoutbreak of the Second World War. It is Ethiopia’s hopethat this shameful episode will not be repeated by theinternational community today  although the nature andscale of the challenge Ethiopia is facing today is radicallydifferent  and is not comparable to what it faced duringthose difficult days on the eve of the Second World War.The United Nations is still grappling with variousissues affecting international peace and security around theworld. Among these  the situation in Angola is a cause forserious concern to us. The behaviour of UNITA clearlyconstitutes a dangerous trend which might lead to thederailment of the peace process — namely  the fullimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol. We urge theUnited Nations to exert the maximum effort to save thefragile situation in Angola and ensure the establishmentof lasting peace and stability in that country.On the situation in the Middle East  we hope everyeffort will be exerted towards the full implementation ofthe Oslo accords  with a view to establishing durablepeace in the area.With regard to the question of Western Sahara  it isour earnest hope that the proposed referendum on thefuture of the territory will be held as soon as possible tobring about a final and successful settlement of the issue.As a founding member of this Organization  Ethiopiahas always been prepared to contribute to the best of itsability to all efforts designed to make the United Nationsand its various organs more effective and morerepresentative. Accordingly  my country attaches greatimportance to the ongoing exercises aimed  among otherthings  at reforming and restructuring the SecurityCouncil. A satisfactory  fruitful and expeditious outcomeof this process is indeed vital for the effectiveness credibility and  I might add  the enhanced legitimacy ofthe world body.For Ethiopia  and for all those who have trust in theefficacy of multilateralism  there is no alternative to theUnited Nations. The Organization should therefore beprotected  and what it stands for — whether in the areasof economic cooperation  disarmament or human rights —should be promoted and fostered with all dedication andcommitment. In this endeavour  Ethiopia will continue tobe second to none in discharging its responsibilities to theUnited Nations in this and other activities of theOrganization.I therefore wish to conclude by renewing Ethiopia’scommitment to the United Nations and to what it standsfor."
"56",2334,"FIN",53,1998,"This year we arecommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamationof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I should liketherefore to congratulate Mr. Opertti very warmly upon hiselection to the presidency of this session. Finland will givehim its full support in his demanding task.Finland aligns itself with the statement made by myAustrian colleague  Mr. Wolfgang SchÃ¼ssel  on behalf ofthe European Union.As has been mentioned in other statements  one of thecatchwords of our time is globalization. We all should beready to contribute to a constructive international dialogueaiming at improving the joint global responses to thevarious challenges emanating from this globalization.We have also done a lot. The United Nations has inthe 1990s convened global conferences to enhancedevelopment in the fields of human rights  sustainableenvironmental development  population policies  socialdevelopment  the advancement of women  food security human settlements and the rights of the child.These conferences have set an ambitious global agendato which Governments are committed. These commitmentsform a road map which guides the Governments  non-governmental organizations and individuals as well as theUnited Nations system. The question remains: can theUnited Nations deliver? Do we  the Member States  wantour Organization to be able to deliver? And do we make itour own responsibility to realize our commitments? Thenand only then can the United Nations deliver.And are we also able to see good partners?Democratic Member States and free  capable citizens andtheir organizations form a good basis for an internationalnetwork of safety in the world of globalization.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has beenand is the basis for developing human rights. We shouldcommemorate the Declaration in the daily activities of ourGovernments and common international institutions.Secretary-General Kofi Annan has emphasized that humanrights are the basis for sustainable human development andfor the sustainability of any community. I subscribe to hiswords and endorse his objective of knitting human rightsinto all United Nations activities. Adequate resourcesshould be secured for this process.The universal nature of human rights should bebeyond question and doubt. All women  men and childrenwho enjoy or are demanding those rights are equalregardless of their nationality or cultural identity.This year  human rights are being made more widelyand better known because there are still women  men andchildren who are not aware of their rights. Yetconsciousness of oneâs rights is the basis for the rule oflaw  democracy  good governance and full enjoyment ofhuman rights. Awareness-raising is the key to concreteresults in the field of human rights.The Criminal Court will become an effectivemechanism for the trial of war criminals  as well as a realdeterrent against genocide  crimes against humanity andwar crimes. It is particularly important that the Courtmake sure also that those individuals who are responsiblefor atrocities in connection with internal conflicts will bebrought to justice.It is important that special provisions for theprotection of women and children were included in thedefinition of war crimes and crimes against humanity aswell as elsewhere in the Statute. The Criminal Courtshould keep this in mind in its everyday work. As theexperience of the two ad hoc tribunals shows  specialexpertise is needed for that purpose.In this connection  let me emphasize that Finlandalso strongly supports the finalization of an optionalprotocol on children in armed conflicts based on an agelimit of 18 years. The suffering inflicted on children byconflicts is intolerable. It is high time to act.We have once again been reminded that terrorismconstitutes a growing threat to human beings  internal andinternational security and the functioning of democraticinstitutions. Within the framework of the United Nations important work has been done in the fight againstterrorism. A sustainable response to terrorism can befound only through intensified efforts within the UnitedNations and improved operational cooperation betweenStates. In this regard  I want to stress that the fightagainst terrorism should be carried out in accordance withrelevant international instruments  including those relatedto human rights.Finland calls for ratification and full implementationof the international conventions on the suppression ofterrorism and an early finalization and acceptance of theconvention on the suppression of acts of nuclearterrorism.25Another way to secure our global neighbourhood is tocontinue disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. Theongoing efforts of the international community werechallenged by the nuclear test explosions by India andPakistan. Finland deplored these actions. Now it isimportant to prevent a nuclear arms race in South Asia. Wecall on India and Pakistan to confirm their promises not totest again through adherence to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The CTBT remains a strong anddynamic cornerstone of the global security system. It servesthe interests of all States.Finland welcomes the agreement to begin negotiationsat the Conference on Disarmament on a treaty banning theproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons. A cap onthe production of fissile material will serve both nucleardisarmament and non-proliferation.Conventional weapons are increasingly included indisarmament efforts. Finland warmly welcomes thisdevelopment. In several conflict areas  the accumulation ofweapons is threatening the very existence of nations. Wewelcome the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention onanti-personnel landmines following the fortieth ratificationlast week.The issue of small arms is acute. Readily available andeasy to use  small arms are the main tools of violence intodayâs conflicts. The world community needs to respondto the problem of small arms through both enhanced globaland regional cooperation. Member States need to controltheir exports and other transfers of small arms. But that isnot enough. An integrated approach involving measuresaddressing both security and development of societies isrequired. Finland supports a lead role for the UnitedNations on the issue of small arms. We look forward to therecommendations next year by the United Nations panel onsmall arms.On the opening day of this session due tribute waspaid to the women and men who have served during thepast 50 years in United Nations peacekeeping operations.The Organization has a unique role in peacekeeping.Finland reiterates its firm support and commitment to thisessential function of the United Nations in global collectivesecurity. The world needs the peacekeeping and peace-building capability of the United Nations. We have tostrengthen the capacity of the Organization in these fields.Finland calls upon Member States to secure financing forthis purpose.Attacks against unarmed United Nations personneland humanitarian workers are increasing. This trend hasto be reversed. Parties to any conflict must respectinternational humanitarian law.We have the global agenda  and the commitmentsare there. For implementation we need a strong UnitedNations. The Secretary-Generalâs reform package must beimplemented without delay. The proposals for reform inthe economic and social sector need to be realized. It isalso high time to enter into real negotiations on thereform of the Security Council. All we need is politicalwill. The reform process must lead to a strengthened andmore efficient United Nations.Finland values the reforms undertaken by theSecretary General  Kofi Annan. We highly appreciate hisleadership as the head of this Organization  and wecontinue to support him in his endeavours. Member Statesmust provide the United Nations with sufficient means.They must fulfil their financial obligations towards theUnited Nations  in full  on time and without conditions.Without a sound financial basis even the efforts atreforming the United Nations are bound to fail.Finland also calls for better cooperation andcoordination of development activities both within theUnited Nations system and between the United Nationsand the Bretton Woods institutions. An efficientimplementation of the global agenda requires morecoherent approaches from the different actors in the fieldof development.Todayâs global  regional and local problems havetheir economic  environmental and social dimensions. Alarge-scale problem of a developmental  ecological orhumanitarian nature may even turn into an armed conflict.Intertwined problems call for integrated responses. Wehave good examples of integrated approaches in southernAfrica  as well as in Guatemala and in El Salvador. Peaceagreements and operational agendas include agreementson human rights  identity and the rights of indigenouspeople  social and economic aspects and strengthening ofcivilian power  as well as defining the role of the armedforces. Constitutional reforms and electoral regimes arealso essential  as is monitoring of the functioning of thecourts as a prerequisite for the reform of judicial systems.We also see the importance of good governance.We must secure the future of the United Nations  interms not only of finance but of political support as well.Here Governments and the Organization can benefit from26public interest in the United Nations. We attach highexpectations to the Millennium Assembly and to the roleand participation of civil society in the Millennium Forum.The Forum can give us guidance from all sectors of oursocieties on which way to continue."
"57",2378,"FJI",53,1998,"My country and my delegationwish to take this opportunity to extend to Mr. DidierOpertti our warmest congratulations on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession. His election to the high office is a tribute to bothhim and his great country. My delegation also wishes toconvey our deep gratitude and appreciation to theoutgoing President at the fifty-second session of theAssembly  His Excellency Hennadiy Udovenko ofUkraine  who presided with boundless energy  vision andcompetence.Change is a fact of life in our world. Change coversnew paradigms  new systems  new technologies  newpatterns in international relations and new initiativesaimed at lasting peace and international security.Thus we welcomed the wind of change in the areaof nuclear disarmament when we adopted theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) twoyears ago. My country was the first to ratify the Treaty.But the more things change  the more they remain thesame. Some months ago  India and Pakistan conductednuclear tests. My delegation calls on India and Pakistanto reconsider their nuclear pretensions and to becomeparties to the CTBT. We call on all countries to becomeparties to this Treaty and to fully implement theprovisions of the Treaty.My delegation would like to see the CTBT improvedto set a clear time-frame for the elimination of all nuclearweapons. As an imperative for meaningful change  my24delegation urges all nuclear-weapon States to destroy allstockpiles and arsenals of nuclear weapons  and in so doingrid our world  once and for all  of nuclear weapons.My delegation also calls for meaningful changeregarding the elimination of all weapons of massdestruction. Let us rid our world of chemical weapons andbiological weapons. We call on all nations to becomeparties to the landmines Convention so that we can all actcollaboratively and meaningfully to rid our world oflandmines as well.Over the past three decades  the developing countriesof the world have waged a desperate struggle forfundamental change in international economic relations inorder to attain economic justice and facilitate economicdevelopment and sustained economic growth — therebylaying the foundation for eradicating the problems of highunemployment  hunger  disease and poverty  which ravagethe least developed and developing countries. Theestablishment of the World Trade Organization wassupposed to have laid the foundation for a new system ofinternational trade relations which would contribute to thedevelopment of developing and least developed countries.As a developing island State  we seek Members?support and indulgence in understanding the special needsand the vulnerability of small island States. They should bedifferentiated further  as a separate group of disadvantagedStates. The work has already started on the determinationof criteria for such differentiation based on a vulnerabilityindex.Among the members of the United Nationsorganizations  development is measured through the humandevelopment index  which takes into account the expansionof gross domestic product  real gross domestic product percapita  life expectancy of the population and otheryardsticks. However  the hurricane that recently struck anumber of islands in the Caribbean  the devastating tidalwave in northern Papua New Guinea and extreme droughtconditions in many countries  including mine  demonstratethe vulnerability of small island States to natural disasters.We also sympathize with China and Bangladesh  whichhave suffered from extensive and prolonged flooding.In Fiji  the Government right now is providing specialfood and water relief assistance to more than 54 000households  or more than a quarter of Fiji?s totalpopulation.Because of the drought  we are expecting this yeara 50 per cent reduction in our production of sugar  whichis our main export  and there is no guarantee for animprovement for next year. Also  because of the drought we do not have seeds of sufficient quality to allow for aquick recovery in the foreseeable future. Such is ourvulnerability  and no part of the aforementioned index hasany real relevance to our calamity. Things may havechanged  with new names and new systems  but  alas  itis the same old story.I appeal to the United Nations development supportsystem to consider special schemes of assistance coveringnatural disaster situations. There are already examples ofsuch schemes in the Lomé Convention between theEuropean Union member countries and the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States.The creation of the World Trade Organization wasintended to lay the foundation for changes in internationaltrade by ensuring an open  secure  equitable  transparentand predictable multilateral trading system. Yetdeveloping countries continue to be paid paltry prices fortheir primary products; they continue to be denied access under one pretext or another  to the markets of thedeveloped countries; and even the little export trade wehave is being taken away  as in the case of Saint Luciaand its banana exports to the European Union. Exporttrade is vital to economic development and sustainedeconomic growth in developing countries. My delegationcalls for remedial change in international trade —facilitating better prices for primary products  greateraccess to the markets of developed countries and theretention of special trade arrangements for the essentialexports of developing countries.We in the developing countries require substantialforeign investment capital flows to promote economicdevelopment  sustained economic growth and social andhuman development. Regrettably  there has been littlechange in the volume of international capital flows  thepace of such flows and the direction of such flows.Where flows have taken place  they have been directed toa handful of developing countries. My delegation calls forstrategic change in the area of foreign investment throughsubstantial  increased and continuous capital flows todeveloping countries.25We in the developing countries require new environmentally sound technologies to facilitate and sustaineconomic development and social and human development.There is a dire need for us to participate in and benefitfrom appropriate  environmentally sound technologies. Yetdespite our pleas for the cooperation and assistance of theindustrialized countries for reciprocal change — by thetransfer of appropriate technologies at an affordable price by assisting us in institutional development and capacity-building to accommodate the transfer of such technologiesand by assisting us with funding  education and trainingprogrammes to facilitate the transfer and stimulate increasedcooperation at a business-to-business level — the situationhas remained virtually the same.Sustainable development is critical to small islanddeveloping States such as mine  for which the paramountchallenge is to balance economic and social developmentwith environmental protection. Six years have passed sincethe first Earth Summit in Rio  and the second summit hascome and gone. Little progress has been made in securingnew sources of financing for making the transition tosustainable development. My delegation calls forstimulating change on the issue of sustainable developmentthrough the prompt and full implementation of thecommitments and recommendations of the United NationsConference on Environment and Development.The reform of the United Nations to make it morerelevant to today?s world and more responsive to the needs aspirations and hopes of the international community in allaspects of international relations has engaged our attentionover the years  and more so last year with the presentationof the Secretary-General?s reform programme. If the reformof the United Nations is to bring about purposeful change then the Charter of the United Nations should be revised toremove the anachronisms contained in it and to make itmore relevant to our world today and tomorrow. Ageographical reconstruction of regional groups adapted tothe geopolitical dimensions of today?s world ought to beimplemented. We submit that the current set of regionalgroups should be increased numerically and reconfigured.My delegation further submits that the membership of allUnited Nations organs and organizations should begoverned by the principle of geographic rotation  so thateach country can enjoy its right as a Member to serve onall United Nations bodies. The current system of rotationhas resulted in some countries becoming de factopermanent members of the United Nations organs andorganizations.The Security Council is a classic example of thingsremaining the same. Membership on the Council permanent and non-permanent  continues to begeographically inequitable. The system of rotation doesnot provide all Member countries the opportunity to serveon the Council  and the system is further aggravated bythe number of regional groups and their geographicalconfiguration. My delegation continues to call for areview of the membership and operations of the Council.International peace and security has been one of themain pillars of the United Nations. This year marks 50years of United Nations peacekeeping as an instrumentfor maintaining international peace and security. Yet weall are still beset by conflicts of one kind or another  andlasting peace and security in our world continues to eludeus. My country is fully committed to the internationalpeacekeeping missions of the United Nations.In fact  this year also marks 20 years of participationby my country in United Nations peacekeeping. I shouldlike to take this opportunity to pay homage to our bravesons who have made the supreme sacrifice in the serviceof international peace and security.Because of the eminent contribution of internationalpeacekeeping to permanent and lasting peace and securityin our world  we call on all Member countries to settletheir assessments for peacekeeping operations promptlyand fully. My delegation would like to take thisopportunity to express to the Secretary-General oursincere and deep appreciation for citing Fiji  among othercountries  as consistently among the stalwart nations readyto contribute troops  police and observers and to takeother steps to improve overall readiness.My delegation deeply appreciates the meaningfulchange that has taken place in the scale of assessments ofMember countries. My country welcomes the newassessment rates. But while such a beneficial measure hastaken place  the arrears in the annual contributions ofsome Member countries continue to plague our coffersand to place the finances of our organizations and ourmany and varied international programmes in jeopardy.My delegation calls on all Member countries which are inarrears in payment to pay those arrears promptly  fullyand without conditions.At a time when so many changes have taken placein our world in the areas of human development andhuman rights  the bleak future of the world?s indigenouspeople has remained the same. My delegation calls on the26international community to be more responsive to the needfor a better future for our indigenous people. In the interestof meaningful change  my delegation calls for the speedyadoption of the draft Declaration on the Rights ofIndigenous Peoples  the setting up in our Organization of aunit for indigenous peoples? affairs  the granting to theindigenous people of the right of self-determination  and theestablishment of an international fund to promote andfacilitate their survival  development and progress.My delegation is aware that the most pervasiveviolation of human rights is violence against women  whichcuts across all boundaries of culture  economic status andgeography. In this connection  the Government of theRepublic of the Fiji Islands has maintained thecommitments entered into at Beijing through theimplementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and metits obligations under the United Nations Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.In promoting greater participation by women ineconomic and social development  a major initiative by theGovernment will be the launch by our Prime Minister  inthe next few days  of its National Plan of Action.Addressed in the Plan will be areas such as thedevelopment and strengthening of women?s enterprises gender parity at decision-making levels  training  promotionand appointments  domestic violence  sexual abuse andchild abuse  and review of laws which disadvantagewomen.One area of meaningful change in our world has beenthe Convention on the Law of the Sea. It enjoys universalsupport and almost universal participation  and all Statesbenefit from the stability and certainty that has beenachieved by the Convention. The work being done withrespect to the oceans requires the support of theinternational community if the achievements of theConvention are to be consolidated and its promise ofbenefits to the peoples of the world realized.Sadly  the more things have changed in the MiddleEast  the more they seem to have remained the same. Peacein the Middle East remains as elusive and perpetuallyshifting as the Negev desert. The international communitymust play a stronger and more decisive role in getting thepeace process on track  keeping it there and ensuring thatit moves at a faster rate. We call on all the parties to thecrisis to pursue positive and genuine negotiations to effectmeaningful change through compromise and achieve a justand lasting peace in the Middle East.My delegation calls for conciliatory change inLebanon with the full implementation of resolution 425(1978) in order that Lebanon may fully enjoy itsterritorial integrity  sovereignty and politicalindependence.Similarly  my delegation believes that a concessionalchange is necessary to find a solution to the situation inKosovo. My delegation calls on the parties to theinternecine conflict to enter into constructive dialogue ona political solution that should include a substantiallygreater degree of autonomy and meaningful self-administration in the territory.The issue of Taiwan has remained unchanged. Chinaand Taiwan contribute significantly to the development ofthe South Pacific region. My country is committed to aone-China policy and enjoys very good relations withboth China and Taiwan. We therefore warmly welcomethe renewed talks between China and Taiwan and hopethat they will lead to profitable change on the Taiwanissue.Likewise  on the Korean peninsula  we urge SouthKorea and North Korea to continue their dialogue toamicably resolve their common future.The removal of tension and the resolution ofremaining international disputes in East Asia are vitallyimportant to the maintenance of peace and security in theentire Asia and Pacific region. For the Fiji Islands andother small island countries in the South Pacific permanent peace in the wider Asia-Pacific region has adirect bearing on our economic future.Given my country?s commitment to global peace  theGovernment of the Republic of the Fiji Islands stronglycondemns international terrorism in all its violent forms.It is a scourge  and all States should treat it as such. Mydelegation urges universal condemnation of suchindiscriminate acts of violence  and we pledge tocooperate with all other members of the GeneralAssembly in preventing such acts and in bringing thoseresponsible to justice.We welcome the recent adoption at Rome of thestatute of the International Criminal Court  and weexpress our gratitude to the Italian Government forhosting the conference at which this took place.Last but not least  my delegation wishes to informthe Assembly that a new Constitution of Fiji was27promulgated on 27 July 1998. Pursuant to the coming intoforce of the new Constitution  the name of our country hasbeen changed to the Republic of the Fiji Islands. Aninnovative feature of the new Constitution is that it makesprovision for the formation of a multi-party system ofGovernment through representation in the Cabinet of allpolitical parties that secure a certain number of seats inParliament.The new Constitution also makes provision for theappointment of a Human Rights Commission and aConstitutional Offices Commission. The Government of theRepublic of the Fiji Islands considers the promulgation ofthe new Constitution as laying the foundation formeaningful change in our multiracial country. Generalelections under the new Constitution are due to be held nextyear.Change is a paradox in international relations. If weare to fashion a new and better international community inwhich international democracy is to prevail and in whichthe development and progress of all nations is to beengendered  we  collectively and in collaboration  have toinculcate change in the many issues which my delegationhas enumerated. We must make meaningful change in ourworld an international imperative."
"58",2425,"FRA",53,1998,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate you  Mr. President on your election  which attests to the high regard in whichthe international community holds you and your country and which France  as an old and true friend of Uruguay welcomes. We hope that the work of the fifty-third sessionof the General Assembly will  under your presidency  leadto the strengthening of the Organization.It was 53 years ago in San Francisco that we  “thepeoples of the United Nations”  decided to join our efforts“to save succeeding generations from the scourge ofwar...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  inthe dignity and worth of the human person...toestablish conditions under which justice...can bemaintained  and to promote social progress”.That immense ambition was justified by the recenthorrors  which at all costs were to be prevented fromhappening again — a necessary utopia  perhaps  or asuperhuman task. But as the great French writer AlbertCamus put it:”Superhuman tasks are the ones man takes a long timeto accomplish  that’s all.”A long time has elapsed  and we are still working onthat  still toiling. We have no reason to be ashamed of whatwe have done as the United Nations throughout these 53years  of what the Security Council and successive GeneralAssemblies have done  as well as seven Secretaries-General — in particular the current one over the last twoyears  whose work has been so outstanding.Over the decades  the Security Council  except whenparalysed by abuse of the veto  has almost always managedto shoulder its primary responsibility for internationalsecurity. When it failed to do so  no other institution wasable to in its stead. Since its first peacekeeping operation 50years ago  the Security Council has launched 49 operationsof this kind.The institutional framework established by theCharter has  in the most varied situations  ranging fromcold war confrontation to the cooperation of recent years proved its irreplaceable usefulness. This again was borneout in the spring of this year during the Iraqi crisis  whenthe Secretary-General was deservedly commended; inAfrica  during the creation of the United Nations Missionin the Central African Republic  which was the firstentirely new peacekeeping operation in four years; andeven in the Balkans  where the difficult mission entrustedto the United Nations in Eastern Slavonia achieved itsobjective.And yet  as the Secretary-General himselfemphasized recently “Unpredictability and surprise have become almostcommonplace” (A/53/1  para. 1) and the illusions of the end of the cold war have notstood the test of reality. Our world  let us acknowledgethis fact  is not moving towards greater harmony.Sometimes our interventions are not appropriate; someStates take advantage of circumstances and deliberatelycarry out archaic policies of force that contravene theprinciples of the Charter. On other occasions  theabdication or implosion of States has released amongvarious groups ancestral forms of hatred that are still verymuch alive  thus facilitating organized crime. All theseare destabilizing factors which  while very different  allhelp to disorganize and imperil international relations.Several major crises have proved this recently. TheAsian financial crisis reminded us that strong growth when badly regulated  is vulnerable in a globalized worldthat is all too often dependent on the ultra-sensitivereactions of the trading floors and the increasingly rapidspread of contagious effects. Each day $1 600 billion isexchanged on the financial markets — huge sums ofmoney that are greater than the means of intervention ofall the financial institutions of the world. In 1970 thoseamounts were equal to the world’s gross national product.Today  they are 15 times greater.The nuclear tests in South Asia were a dramaticreminder that a very serious regional territorial disputecombined with a feeling  justified or not  of insecuritycould open the way to nuclear and ballistic proliferation.In East Africa  a typical armed conflict was born ofa border dispute. In the Great Lakes region  six or sevenStates are in the grip of regional conflict on the territory15of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Destabilizationis threatening Central Asia  starting with Afghanistan. Icannot list them all  but currently more than 30 conflicts civil wars or State break-ups are under way that involvemore than 40 countries in their aftermath of suffering.Twenty-two million civilians — displaced persons andreturnees — have been affected by these conflicts andrequire assistance from the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Refugees  which is currently activein 118 countries. Nor can I fail to mention child soldiers;slavery  which still goes on in a scarcely veiled form;disappeared persons; and so many other tragedies.But I do not wish my statement to be a long litany ofwoe that is only too familiar to the United Nations  whichis the first to learn of these situations. Is it not at this verymoment trying to maintain peace on four continents withapproximately 15 000 personnel engaged in about 17operations? To cite just one example  no fewer than 20agencies are trying to rebuild Bosnia.Nor do I intend to neglect the progress achieved in1998  which I mentioned at the beginning of my statement.I wish simply to explain that the United Nations and themultilateral system do not today have the necessary meansto meet all these challenges. But we cannot and must notgive up. How can we restore the necessary vigour to ouraction?Allow me to make some suggestions in this area. First we can preserve the powers that the Charter has given ourinstitutions. The first priority is to reserve for the SecurityCouncil a monopoly on legitimate enforcement action in thecase of “threats to the peace  breaches of the peace  andacts of aggression”.Nothing can justify the use of force by a State  agroup of States or an organization  however powerful  ifprior authorization was not received from the SecurityCouncil — except in cases of self-defence.My country shares the impatience of those whodeplore the fact that it should take so long to find a solutionto various cruel conflicts — for example  in Kosovo  wherethe humanitarian situation is so critical. Since November1997 France has warned of the risks of explosion; it has putforward many proposals in liaison with Germany and itsother partners in the Contact Group to prepare the groundfor a realistic political solution. It has just begun action forthe return of refugees. It has never ruled out the possibleuse of force. On this latter point  I hear voices urging us toforgo the authorization of the Security Council. But afterthis case there would be another exception  and thenanother. Little by little  any country would declare itselfentitled to intervene wherever its interests  security orambitions so required  and we would have to begin allover again. We must remain firm on this principle.Second  we must make sure that the authority of theSecurity Council is respected and its resolutions arecomplied with. This goes for all its resolutions. But todaythe question arises particularly in connection with Iraq.The lifting of the oil embargo has  by the Council’sresolutions  been made subject to the controlleddismantling of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq musttherefore meet these conditions — completely meet them but only them. Once that objective is achieved  our aimmust be to reintegrate Iraq into the internationalcommunity  starting with the region.The only way to achieve that end is by Iraq’scomplete compliance with the relevant resolutions — allthe resolutions  nothing but the resolutions — whichmeans Iraq’s unreserved cooperation with the UnitedNations and the bodies empowered to monitor Iraq’sdisarmament.The third need is to increase the representativenessof the Security Council in order to increase its legitimacy.This is why my country has come out in favour ofenlarging the Security Council  with  on the one hand new permanent members — two seats for the North  towhich Germany and Japan have every claim  and threefor the South; on the other hand  there should be newnon-permanent members for the North and South. Thisenlargement must at the same time preserve the Council’seffectiveness and not prevent it from carrying out itsresponsibilities under the Charter. I hope this fifty-thirdsession of the Assembly will see progress on this reform.Fourth  we must increase the capacity of ourOrganization to prevent or settle regional crises. There ismuch to be done. Now that the international communityhas just commemorated on a melancholy note the fifthanniversary of the Oslo accords  what remains of thepeace process in the Middle East and the hopes born inMadrid? There is no longer a light shining in the night and the fires of hatred are gaining ground. Francecontinues to support the persevering efforts of the UnitedStates Secretary of State  but we do not wish to be leftwithout any prospects at all should those effortsunfortunately not succeed. That is why President Chiracand President Mubarak have proposed in that eventconvening a conference of countries resolved to save the16peace. This concern for the future has been very wellreceived. In liaison with Mr. Amre Moussa  we are workingto further our proposal. We must not abandon the goal ofmeeting the aspirations of the peoples of this region for ajust and lasting peace which respects the resolutions andagreements that have been reached.Another region in crisis calls for our attention. As Imentioned earlier on the territory of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo six or seven African States of theGreat Lakes region are engaged in confrontation in a tangleof problems involving border issues  guerrilla activities ethnic strife  refugees  the quest for arable land and soforth. It is illusory to hope for a separate settlement in eachof these States. A regional crisis such as this calls for aregional solution. That is why my country has raised againthe idea of a conference for peace in the Great Lakesregion  which we suggested as early as 1995. Theconference would be placed under the aegis of the UnitedNations or the Organization of African Unity  with theactive participation of the States of the region. SeveralAfrican diplomatic initiatives have the same goal. Wesupport those efforts.Africa is currently the theatre of other crises. Let uspay tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General’srepresentatives. Here I salute in particular the memory ofMatre Blondin Beye  who died while on a peace mission.Fifth  there is a need to reinforce the multilateraldisarmament and non-proliferation system. Following thenuclear tests in South Asia  whose risks everyonerecognizes  we must strengthen the anti-proliferation regimeand pursue the disarmament process in all areas — nuclear conventional  chemical and biological.Our primary objective here should be the entry intoforce as speedily as possible of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. France  together with the UnitedKingdom  was the first nuclear-weapon State to ratify theTreaty and is the only one to have completed thedismantlement of its testing centre. I call on all States thathave not yet done so to accede to this Treaty — includingIndia and Pakistan  which have announced their intentionnot to carry out any more nuclear tests.Another objective here would be a treaty banning theproduction of fissile material for military purposes. Iproposed at the meeting of the five permanent members ofthe Security Council held in Geneva on 4 June last that weshould launch such a negotiation. A universal  non-discriminatory and verifiable cut-off treaty would givenew impetus to disarmament.We should also pursue relentlessly the prohibition ofchemical and biological weapons. Let us see to it that theConvention banning chemical weapons becomes universaland that the Convention banning biological weapons ismade truly effective through a verification mechanism.Combating the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction also means preventing the spread of vehiclescapable of delivering such weapons  while preservinguseful civilian applications.In order to make progress in conventionaldisarmament  let us ensure that the Ottawa Conventionproviding for a comprehensive ban on anti-personnelmines comes into force as soon as possible.Sixth  we should continue to combatunderdevelopment  whose link with crises needs nofurther demonstration. France remains heavily committed;it is the second largest provider of official developmentassistance. In order to modernize its aid and make it moreeffective  France has decided to reform its cooperationarrangements and increase coordination with other donors— in the first place with the European Union. More than60 per cent of aid to Africa comes from the EuropeanUnion. Europe is also the largest source of aid to LatinAmerica and the second largest to Asia.France would like development resources to be morepredictable. The Secretary-General has made proposalsthat we welcome in a constructive spirit  in particular theidea of a development account. We encourage the UnitedNations to continue its discussions in this area.Seventh  we need to work with the non-governmental organizations. They are capable of soundingthe alarm  making proposals and cooperating in verypractical terms to help build States governed by the ruleof law. Parallel to these actions  we expect much from theactivities of Mrs. Robinson  United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights  both in the Commissionon Human Rights and in the various United Nationsagencies  which must also — all of them — integrate thehuman rights dimension into their activities.After more than 10 years of negotiations  1998 willsee the adoption of the declaration on the defenders ofhuman rights. This is a crucial text because these are therights that dictatorships try to stifle and threaten.17However  even if we reinforce the Security Council strengthen the hand of the Secretary-General and betterhandle future crises and other aspects of existing ones  thiswill still not be enough. We must regain the initiative  andfor that we must extend our efforts to bring worldwideregulation to other fields. This brings me to my final points.The eighth requirement is to extend the rule of law inall its aspects. The Statute of a permanent InternationalCriminal Court was adopted in Rome after intensivenegotiations. It is a major step forward in the fight againstthe impunity of the foremost criminals. France was one ofthe first to sign it. The Statute achieves an essentialsynthesis of the various legal traditions in the world andstrikes a balance between the Court’s competences and thepowers of the Security Council that is in keeping with thespirit and calling of the United Nations. We hope that thosecountries that still have reservations will be able to join us.In another field of law  the International LabourOrganization has taken a historic step towards universalcompliance with basic labour standards through thedeclaration adopted at its eighty-sixth conference  which isa commitment on the part of the 174 member States of theOrganization.On 11 November 1997 the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization adoptedthe Universal Declaration on the Human Genome andHuman Rights. This is the first normative framework toguide the international community in an area of scientificresearch where advances are already shaking our traditionalconcepts of life and social organization. France issubmitting a draft resolution calling on the GeneralAssembly to endorse this Universal Declaration.Ninth  we must contain and reduce the scourge oforganized crime  beginning with drugs. The volume ofillegal drug trafficking now approaches $500 billion — 8per cent to 10 per cent of world trade. According to theInternational Monetary Fund  money-laundering operationsrepresent from 2 per cent to 5 per cent of global grossdomestic product.At the special session in New York in June wedecided to put more emphasis on reducing the demand fordrugs  in addition to what we have done about supply. Letus do so.Tenth  we must combat terrorism in all its forms whoever the perpetrators and whatever their motivation.The recent International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings is an important stepforward  but that is not enough. We must also acquire themeans to hunt down those who finance and instigate theseattacks. France is proposing the negotiation of a universalconvention against the financing of terrorism.We need to define concrete mechanisms for legalmeasures and mutual judicial assistance against those whofinance terrorism. Effective sanctions  such as the seizureor the freezing of the assets of organizations orindividuals that have participated in terrorist acts must beprovided for. Innovative measures  such as making itimpossible to invoke banking secrecy in judicial bodiesinvestigating a terrorist attack  should be introduced. If wehave the will to do this  we can launch this negotiation atthe end of the present session of the General Assembly.President Clinton spoke here on Monday of thiscommon struggle as a shared obligation. This is correct.In addition  we need to attack the multiple causes thatbreed terrorism.The eleventh point I would like to make concernsthe remedy for not only the current financial crises  butalso the malfunctioning of the international financialsystem as such. That is the issue here  as is shown by theincreasing calls for a “new Bretton Woods”. Financialglobalization is running wild now. New means urgentlyneed to be found. It is the responsibility of each State tomake its contribution. We need also to define new rulesadapted to today’s financial realities. My country is todaypresenting to its European partners some proposals tocounter international financial instability.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) mustnaturally remain the pivot here. But the IMF must bemore legitimate and more effective  working on the basisof clear  realistic  political and strategic guidelines cooperating with other competent bodies  organizingdialogue between industrialized countries and emergingcountries  ensuring the transparency of the financialsystem and reflecting the economic  social and politicalrealities of partner countries — an IMF that can detectearly warning signs to prevent crises from happening.Within this transformation  to which the Director-General of the IMF is making an important contribution and also in order better to stabilize the internationaleconomic and monetary situation and to support worldgrowth  Europe will play an increasingly important role18since it is finalizing the introduction of its single currency the euro  and we are anticipating the benefits.From this period we are living through  which is sofull of contrasts  consisting of unprecedented progress andof crises threatening to wipe out our efforts  in particularthose made under the aegis of the United Nations additional progress must be forthcoming in building a morejust and more peaceful world  because this is what we allwant.Today’s world needs rules. The United Nations mustremain the unifying framework  and the Charter mustremain the reference point. Preserving what has proved itsworth  adapting when necessary  inventing new forms ofregulation — these are three main areas for our work."
"59",2450,"FSM",53,1998,"It is my high honour to address theAssembly today  both as the Chairman of the SouthPacific Forum and as the President of the FederatedStates of Micronesia.First of all  Mr. President  for the South PacificForum and for my country  I wish to express sincerecongratulations on your election to the highest positionone can hold in this body. We are confident that yourstrong experience and leadership will provide the rudderthat is needed here to steer us safely through the manychallenges that lie ahead.I also thank the President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-second session  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko ofUkraine  for his skilful guidance throughout the past yearduring most difficult and troubling times.Recognition also must be given to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  whose tireless and effectivework in both leadership and coordinating roles is wellknown to all of us.The Federated States of Micronesia was honoured tohost the twenty-ninth summit of leaders of the SouthPacific Forum in Pohnpei on 24 and 25 August. As aresult  I have the privilege and heavy responsibility ofreporting to this organ the consensus achieved by all 16member countries of the Forum at that summit.The South Pacific Forum is a unique institutioninvolving independent and self-governing States whichshare a very special part of the world. Forum membercountries differ greatly in land area  ocean area  population resource endowment  economic development andindustrialization  social structures  cultures and livingstandards. However  we all share a common bond as Forummembers and have established agreed positions on a widerange of issues which transcend our diversity. We have alsoagreed to work together to pursue cohesion  stability andwell-being in our countries.At the recent summit  the heads of Government andrepresentatives of the 16 member countries reviewedprogress and took decisions on a number of issuesconsidered important to the region  which were generally ofa political  economic or environmental nature. I willmention briefly some of the subjects that were discussedand refer for further details to the Forum communiqué which is to be issued as a document of this GeneralAssembly.The overall theme of the Forum?s summit this yearwas “From Reform to Growth: The Private Sector andInvestment as Keys to Prosperity”. In this regard  theForum agreed that efforts should be made to ensuremacroeconomic stability by improving fiscal discipline further promoting public sector reforms and broadening thetax base. It also emphasized the need to introduce a widerange of policy  legal  regulatory and institutional reformswhich provide the private sector with a more favourableand competitive business environment.Leaders noted that good overall progress has beenmade in the implementation of the Forum Economic ActionPlan  which aims at strengthening the economies of theisland countries. This progress was made despite suchdifficulties as capacity constraints facing some members the backdrop of region-specific difficulties  notably droughtand other disasters  and the problems faced by membercountries on account of the Asian economic crisis. Specificrecommendations were endorsed concerning the region?sresponse to undesirable economic activities  the promotionof competitive telecommunications markets  thedevelopment of information infrastructure and work relatedto the Forum Free Trade Area.On a related matter  the Forum revisited the objectiveof having the United Nations adopt a vulnerability index with the aim of having such an index included among thecriteria for determining least developed country status anddeciding eligibility for concessional aid and trade treatment.It was noted with pleasure that the United NationsEconomic and Social Council had agreed to deferconsideration of Vanuatu?s graduation from leastdeveloped country status for one year  pending furtherconsideration of the vulnerability index issue  and that theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)have created a task force on the subject. While these stepshave been important  much work remains ahead to gainfull international recognition of vulnerability in its variousmanifestations as obstacles to the sustainable developmentof small island developing States.The Forum solidly reaffirmed its previousendorsement of the Barbados Programme of Action forthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates as a comprehensive framework with great potentialfor the region  and noted the efforts under way for itsimplementation  but that much remains unaddressed. It isbelieved that the special session of the General Assemblyin 1999 to review the Plan of Action will represent animportant opportunity for the region. Support wasexpressed for national  regional and transregionalactivities in the run-up to the special session  both tobetter position ourselves for effective participation and toraise pre-sessional awareness of the situation of smallisland developing States.One issue that received a great deal of attention atthis year?s Forum summit was that of global climatechange  and in particular the risk of sea level rise broughton or hastened by human activities affecting theatmosphere. The Forum?s membership includes two annexI parties to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change. All the rest  including several which arenot United Nations Members  are small island developingcountries and committed members of the Alliance ofSmall Island States (AOSIS). We are driven in that regardby deep concerns about our very survival.It was encouraging and perhaps indicative to othersthat despite a wide diversity of interests on this issue theForum succeeded in reaching a comprehensive position.The Forum recognized the legally binding commitmentsagreed to in the Kyoto Protocol as a significant first stepforward on the path of ensuring effective global action tocombat climate change. The Forum encouraged allcountries to sign the Kyoto Protocol and to work towardsits earliest possible ratification. In particular  noting thatthe Framework Convention obliges developed countryparties to take the lead in combating climate change andthe adverse effects thereof  the Forum stressed theimportance of implementing measures to ensure earlyprogress towards meeting the commitments in the KyotoProtocol. This applies particularly to the United States 2the European Union  the Russian Federation  Japan  Canadaand other annex I emitters.The Forum called for substantial progress at theupcoming fourth session of the Conference of the Parties tothe Framework Convention in Buenos Aires in establishingthe rules for international implementation mechanisms —particularly emissions trading  the clean developmentmechanism and joint implementation — to ensure that thesemechanisms assist the effectiveness of greenhouse-gasreduction efforts.It was also noted that an effective global response tothe problem of climate change will require ongoing activecooperation and strengthened action by all parties  takingaccount of their common but differentiated responsibilitiesand their respective capabilities. The Forum stressed theurgent need to initiate a process to develop procedures andfuture time-frames for wider global participation inemissions limitation and reduction in which significantdeveloping country emitters would enter into commitmentswhich reflect their individual national circumstances anddevelopment needs. But remember  developed countriesmust take the lead.The Forum noted with relief and gratitude therecognition in the Kyoto Protocol of the importance of theadaption needs of small island States. The leaders called foradequate resources to be generated through theimplementation mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol and theGlobal Environment Facility for the full range of adaptionmeasures. The Forum countries anticipate maximizing thebenefits to them from such implementation measures andmechanisms through the work of another regionalorganization  the South Pacific Regional EnvironmentProgramme.Respectful of the wide range of reactions and emotionssurrounding the outcome of Kyoto  and recognizing also thedifficult challenges that will face the delegates at BuenosAires  it is suggested that the Forum consensus should betaken as a harbinger of the possibilities for finding commonground on a larger playing field — one on which theultimate fate of all of us may be decided.Before I leave the subject of climate change  I wouldlike to express gratitude to the donor nations that respondedrecently to the suffering visited upon Pacific island peoplesby the climatic phenomenon of El Niño. Whether or notscientists can decide conclusively that the recent intensityof the El Niño effect is a symptom of global climatechange  it is a fact that entire island populations foundthemselves in a situation where their very survivaldepended on the willingness of other countries to provideemergency assistance. We will always be thankful thatsuch assistance was forthcoming.While we express our appreciation  we are alsomindful of the situation of the devastation that has beencreated by Hurricane Georges in the southern UnitedStates  and we are hoping and praying that thisphenomenon will pass  giving relief to the people.Another issue of immediate and continuingenvironmental concern to our Forum region is theongoing practice by industrialized Powers of shippingradioactive wastes back and forth through our economiczones in the advancement of their own national interestsand priorities  irrespective of our strenuous and continuingprotests. The Forum noted that some strides have beenmade in exchanging information on these shipments  butthe risks remain. At the very minimum  we continue toseek a strong regime of prior notification to andconsultation with coastal States on planned shipments ofhazardous wastes  and the development of a regime tocompensate the region for actual economic losses causedto tourism  fisheries and other affected industries in thearea.The Forum leaders could not help but note withalarm the recent tests of nuclear devices by India andPakistan. They expressed grave concern that the recentnuclear tests constitute a threat to the international processof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty. It will be recalled that the region encompassed bythe Forum members has perhaps greater standing than anyother region in the world to express alarm over thecontinued testing of nuclear devices. The Forum membershave endured and continue to endure the human sufferingthat has resulted from the curse of nuclear proliferationand testing. The Pacific island countries are taking actionwithin the region to counter the presence of nuclearweapons and the testing of nuclear devices through theSouth Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. We call upon theUnited States to ratify that Treaty.Finally  as regards the South Pacific Forum — andI stress that I do not mention here every issue that wasdiscussed or covered in the communiqué — I want torelate the Forum?s pleasure in drawing attention to thesigning of the Noumea Accord between the Governmentof France and the concerned parties in New Caledonia.This Accord represents a tremendous accomplishment by3all involved in moving forward the process of self-determination for New Caledonia  whatever the ultimateoutcome of that process might be.I have already consumed much of my time incommenting on issues that concern the South Pacific Forumas a group. Briefly now  I ask that you focus your attentionon the situation of my small island developing country.The Federated States of Micronesia is approaching theend of the millennium with a sense of unsettlement. Wewill be among the first to celebrate the beginning of thenew epoch  but  in an immediate sense  what does thiscelebration promise for us? Our developmental processbegan only a few years ago  and the barriers we face interms of need for technology and manpower development scarcity of resources  our remote location and smallpopulation — to name only a few — are beyond ourcapability to overcome alone.We are indeed fortunate to be receiving substantialassistance from the United States and other bilateralpartners  but our long-term future cannot and should notdepend upon bilateral assistance. Perhaps it is not realisticfor us to plan for complete self-sufficiency  but we do wantto become  and we must become  more self-reliant.We in the Federated States of Micronesia have someconcerns that the emphasis of effort in the United Nationsis being somewhat drawn away from the balance betweenaddressing the overall interests of all countries and at thesame time particularly assisting developing countries tomove towards their rightful condition. In other words  wefear that the traditional role of the Organization in assistingless advanced countries with their development could bemarginalized. I use the phrase “drawn away” because theshift to which I refer would not be something that leaderssat down and purposefully decided on. In large part  giventhe breadth of the Charter  the United Nations is simply indanger of becoming overwhelmed by its responsibilities. Asregional and national conflicts proliferate  drug traffickingflourishes  terrorism looms as an ever more dangerous partof our daily lives  and as the global environment becomesincreasingly threatened  the demands on the time andresources of this body and its Members to confrontimmediate problems are compelling.But while the need to move towards a closer paritybetween the living standards of the North and the Southnecessitates long-term solutions  it cannot be forgotten thatin the long term the accomplishment of that goal will domuch to address the problems to which I have justreferred  which seem beyond the reach of immediate solutions.Meanwhile  as developing countries  we too must doour part. We must create the flexible  though outward-oriented  economies that can maximize the benefits of theglobal economy in which we also exist. At the same time we must not forget that our national identities and uniquenational and subnational social  political and economicsituations demand a proactive approach that avoidsblindly jumping on the bandwagon of the latestdevelopment initiatives in order to reap the perceivedbenefits of donor assistance. In realizing that mistakesinevitably are made and opportunities lost  we must notlose our sense of self-confidence or permit ourselves tobecome overly prone to accepting the dictates of well-meaning donor partners whose understanding of oursituation may not be complete.But we must also remain very alert to the need forcourse correction and we must endure periods ofstructural  institutional and even behavioural change. Theprocess is now ongoing in my country. With theassistance of the Asian Development Bank and donorpartners  we are well along in implementing a two-pronged programme that involves Government and publicenterprise reforms  on the one hand  and private sectorreforms  on the other. On the Government side  we arereorganizing and downsizing our institutions andimproving our tax structure in order to move along theadjustment path to sustainable finances and rationalservice levels. On the private sector side  our reforms aredesigned to improve the economic environment forprivate sector growth  especially in those productiveactivities that earn dollars from abroad. This means among other things  reducing the role of Government inproductive activities and restructuring our legal andregulatory environment to encourage private sectoractivity and investment  especially foreign investment.Despite our determination to carry through thiseffort  we know that it alone will not producedevelopment. It will facilitate development and make ourapplication of development assistance far more effective.But now  perhaps more than ever  we will require thepatience  understanding and continued support of donorpartners and international institutions  which have been soinstrumental in helping us to reach this point.This is to be a session during which two veryimportant anniversaries are celebrated: 50 years of UnitedNations peacekeeping and 50 years of the Universal4Declaration of Human Rights. As to the first  I wish tohonour those who served in the peacekeeping operations ofthe past 50 years  especially those who lost their lives inthe service of the United Nations. As to the second  thevital role played by the Declaration hardly needs myendorsement; but I would refer to my statement at the 1993Vienna World Conference on Human Rights  when  inspeaking with respect to those who have given their livesin the cause of human rights  I said:“Those very heroes would be among the first to say 'Let?s look into the past only for what we can learnfrom it. The job is not yet done  and our enemy growsstronger.'”It only remains for me to refer to the activities of theinternational community and this body having to do withmy country?s predominant resource — the ocean. This isthe International Year of the Ocean. The world can littleafford to miss the opportunities presented by this occasionto focus on our planet?s most prevalent yet least understoodphysical mechanism. The single best example of thatdangerously incomplete understanding surely is the ocean-generated  worldwide disaster of El Niño  which occurred ironically  this year.For obvious reasons  the peoples of Micronesiasecured involvement in the long negotiations that led to theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea evenbefore we emerged from Trusteeship status. We havecontinued that involvement as a party to the Conventionand now call on all States to ratify the Convention andparticipate fully in the process. We support the Tribunal forthe Law of the Sea  as well as resolutions aimed ateradicating the practice of driftnet fishing and unauthorizedfishing in areas of national jurisdiction. We urge action toreduce by-catches  fish discards and post-harvest losses.Looking towards the Assembly?s special session on theBarbados Programme of Action  and also towards nextyear?s consideration of oceans by the Commission onSustainable Development  we encourage the recognition oflinkages between the various related issues and the need formore integrated treatment. By necessity  I speak of linkagesand integration  which are familiar terms of usage withinthe United Nations system but there is nothing routineabout the devastations of El Niño that were visited upon mycountry?s people earlier this year and upon other peoplesaround the world. I can think of no better example of theneed for the recognition of linkages in terms of ocean andclimatic issues and the necessity for the application ofintegrated response measures.In closing  I should like to refer to the fact that  inrecent years  as the problems of our increasingly complexand globalized society appear to have escalated  it hasbecome fashionable in some quarters to question whetherthe United Nations Organization is worth maintaining. Itis as though the world?s peoples expect that the worth ofthis Organization is to be tested by its efficiency in“fixing” a set of global problems  after which presumably  we would all live happily ever after. Thatmistaken notion is grounded in the assumption thatinternational cooperation exists only for immediateproblem-solving.Speaking for a relatively new Member country of theUnited Nations  allow me to suggest humbly that therepetition of mistakes of whatever scale and the creationof new crises along with every step forward is elementalto the human condition. The Charter of this Organization monumental as it may be  is still a document designed byand for human beings on this planet and must be judgedand applied in light of the human experience. The UnitedNations should not be expected to work itself out of ajob.The people and the Government of the FederatedStates of Micronesia deeply respect the pastaccomplishments of the United Nations and look forwardto continuing to meet our commitments to it  even thoughour contributions may appear small."
"60",2493,"GAB",53,1998,"Iwish first to convey to Mr. Didier Opertti the warm sincere congratulations of the Government and thedelegation of Gabon on his well-deserved election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession. This is a tribute to his country  Uruguay  and anunambiguous recognition of his personal and professionalqualities. Our congratulations go also to all the otherAssembly officers  and we wish them every success inguiding our work. We assure them of the support andcooperation of the delegation of Gabon.To the President of the General Assembly at the fifty-second session  Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko  who spared noeffort in carrying out his responsibilities  I convey oursatisfaction and our deep gratitude.The present times are characterized by politicaltension  by change and by socio-economic upheavalexacerbated by a grave financial crisis; our involvement isrequired  in more than one respect. Gabon remainsconvinced that the United Nations continues to be the bestforum for working together to harmonize our differentapproaches towards peace and development. We owe it toourselves to consider the circumstances in which theOrganization was established to free the world from thespectre of war. Was it just to prevent world war  or was itto make use of the renewed humanism inspired by the SanFrancisco Conference to eradicate all the causes of armedconflict wherever they might emerge so as  in the words ofthe Charter  “to promote social progress and betterstandards of life in larger freedom”?Now more than in the past  and especially since theend of the cold war  narrow nationalism has beenresurfacing to nullify all the international community?sefforts to make of our world a global village in whichpeace and security  friendship among nations andinternational cooperation are the watchwords. Peace is asine qua non for the development of peoples and of nations.That truth is easy enough to affirm  but applying it iscomplicated by the play of interests within States  oftencombined with outside interference.This has been and remains the bitter experience ofAfrica. For nearly a decade  the African continent has facedmultifaceted political tension and violence between andwithin States  just when the end of the cold war had givenrise to hope that resources would be mobilized for itsdevelopment.Yet during that same period many African countrieshave courageously embarked on political reform andeconomic restructuring. Overall  there has been tangibleprogress. Clearly  stability is indispensable for suchprogress  which means that questions of internationalpeace and security are the concern of the day on ourcontinent  and more specifically in Central Africa. Thatsubregion  so rich in potential  has come since the end ofthe cold war to be a world disrupted by “the disorder ofnations”  fuelled and maintained by a variety of forces.Although living in peace within its borders and withits neighbours  Gabon is extremely concerned at thissituation. President Bongo believes that our countrycannot remain an isle of peace  freedom and even relativeprosperity in an ocean of misery  violence and fratricidalwars. That concern is shared by the other heads of Stateof Central Africa  and was at the root of the summitconference held on Thursday  24 September 1998  atLibreville  at the initiative of President Bongo  on thesituation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thatimportant meeting gave heads of State and heads ofdelegation an opportunity to express their support forPresident Kabila and to condemn the aggression againstthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and theinterference in the internal affairs of that country. Theycalled for the withdrawal of foreign forces of aggression;for a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;for respect for the territorial integrity of that country; andfor continuing the process of democratization begun bythe Government of the Democratic Republic of theCongo.They also stressed the need for concerted action bythe countries of Central Africa  the States members of theSouthern African Development Community  of theOrganization of African Unity and of the United Nations and all those who are working to find a solution to theCongo crisis  renouncing any partisan decisions that couldprolong the suffering of the peoples of Congo and ofneighbouring States. The heads of State and heads ofdelegation of Central Africa therefore decided to establisha summit follow-up and negotiating committee under thechairmanship of the President of the Gabonese Republic and reaffirmed that it would be appropriate to establish aregional peacekeeping force.Turning to Angola  I wish first to honour thememory of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Matre Alioune Blondin Beye  and of membersof his team  who worked tirelessly for peace in thatcountry  tragically giving their lives to that cause. Theheads of State and of delegation reaffirmed at theLibreville summit their support for the Government ofAngola  which is sparing no effort in the search for25lasting peace in that country and for the full and speedyimplementation of the Lusaka accords.Finally  with regard to the Republic of the Congo  theheads of State supported the reconstruction and nationalreconciliation efforts and condemned the destabilizationmanoeuvres originating outside the country.Of course  we are not insensitive to the disturbancesand violence occurring in other parts of the world — quitethe contrary. Gabon shares the position of the Organizationof African Unity (OAU) on ways and means of resolvingthe problems in Sierra Leone  Guinea-Bissau  Liberia andSomalia and between Ethiopia and Eritrea. We arefollowing most attentively the resumption of dialoguebetween the Israelis and Palestinians  as seen in the recentsummit meetings. These talks offer a glimmer of hope fora global settlement of the problems of the Middle East. Welikewise believe that only political means will return peaceto Afghanistan. With the same conviction  we encourage theefforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN) to preserve peace in South-East Asia.A global vision of peace is certainly necessary. In fact through the phenomenon of globalization  the shock waveof conflict is often felt very far from the epicentre. It isequally clear that development cannot be ensured in anunstable environment  for peace constitutes the fertileground in which development must take root and prosper.It is in that spirit that Gabon studied the remarkablereport (A/52/871) that the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  submitted to the Security Council on the causes ofconflict in Africa. He very rightly noted that historicallegacies  internal and external factors  economic motivesand particular situations are the source of many conflicts inAfrica. These various causes are known to us and we mustcombat them.In this respect  I would like to draw the attention ofthe Assembly particularly to one of the causes of conflictthat I believe should be given our full attention because ofthe many dangers it poses to the stability of our entirecontinent. Furthermore  this phenomenon is also evident inCentral and Eastern Europe. I refer to the question oftransnational populations — in other words  communitiesdispersed over several States as a result of various historicalcircumstances. Aware of the danger in Africa  the foundingfathers of the OAU  in their great wisdom  inscribed in itsCharter the principle of the inviolability of frontiersinherited from colonization. To reshape States on the basisof diverse claims seemed to them to be simply risky. Theytherefore chose to take charge of our history through theopenness of integration. Gabon reaffirms its support forthis approach.All in all  the resurgence of nationalism  poorunderstanding and abuse of the rights of peoples as wellas their manipulation  inevitably lead to national unrest with its attendant deadly difficulties. Faced with theserealities and possibilities  the Government of Gabonwould more than ever like to reaffirm its commitment tocertain principles which underlie the maintenance ofpeace and security  both internally and internationally.These include respect for human rights in general and forthe rights of national minorities in particular; respect forcultural identities; respect for the territorial integrity ofStates; respect for national sovereignty; the principle ofnon-interference in internal affairs; the principle of goodneighbourliness; and the principle of the peacefulsettlement of disputes.In any event  dialogue remains the best and mosteffective way of preventing conflicts and maintaining orrestoring peace. Political differences must have a politicalresponse. The African populations  already overwhelmedby underdevelopment  cannot and should not have toendure  in addition  the deadly consequences of conflict.We must therefore always engage in dialogue. This iswhy President Bongo  sensing the changes in history andthe aspirations of his people  set in motion in mid-1989the rethinking within the former single party in ourcountry that led to the national conference of March-April1990  which reopened the way to pluralism anddemocracy.New regulatory and control institutions havegradually been established since then and they areworking. Individual and collective freedoms arerecognized and enjoyed by our citizens  who can evenappeal as high as the Constitutional Court  as a glance atour newspapers in Gabon suffices to make clear. Thisshows how deeply committed we are to the principles ofparticipatory democracy  taking into account our overalllevel of development and our sociological environment.It is also in this new context that in two months weshall be organizing presidential elections for the secondtime. The logistical and legislative preparations arealready at a very advanced stage; they are basically thework of government. The National Electoral Commission which is already in place  will conduct the actual electoraloperations. Its representatives were appointed last week inall departments and communes. The Prime Minister sent26invitations a month ago to various States and organizations including the United Nations  to observe both thepreparations and the polling process itself.A few days ago I had the opportunity to address theSecurity Council on mechanisms for conflict prevention inour subregion. Without repeating the report that has beenmade to the Assembly  I would like to recall here that  inaccordance with the decision made by the heads of State orGovernment of the countries of Central Africa  Defence andInterior Ministers of the countries members of the UnitedNations Standing Advisory Committee on SecurityQuestions in Central Africa  meeting in Libreville from 28to 30 April 1998  re-examined the plan for theestablishment of an early-warning mechanism as aninstrument for the prevention of crises and conflicts. Gabon which now holds the chairmanship of the Committee  isdoing everything in its power to meet the logistics needs toallow Libreville to be the headquarters of that mechanism.Along the same lines  also concerning the logic ofprevention  the Committee held from 18 to 21 May 1998 inBata  Equatorial Guinea  the first conference on thequestion of relationships between democratic institutionsand peace in Central Africa. That conference broughttogether members of Governments  representatives ofopposition political parties  high-ranking officials of theforces of law and order  representatives of civil society andexperts on matters of political freedoms  the press andhuman rights. The participants? main recommendation wasthe establishment of a subregional parliament of CentralAfrica  which would be charged with dealing with questionsof common interest  with a view to strengthening measuresfor confidence-building and subregional peace  whileserving as a forum for harmonization of views and thepromotion of values related to the democratic experiencesof member States. In general  we can say that the action ofthe Committee is a needed extension of the Organization ofAfrican Unity?s Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution.All these preventive measures would be in vain if theinternational community made no further disarmamentefforts. My country supports the high priority given by theUnited Nations to the question of disarmament in generaland to the elimination of nuclear weapons and otherweapons of mass destruction in particular. Even if the harmthey can cause is less  we are also concerned about theproliferation of conventional weapons  which are also toolsof death and destruction. We therefore commend thestatement by the President of the Security Council on theoccasion of the ministerial meeting on Africa held on 24September 1998  in which the Council asked the ad hocWorking Group to elaborate further concreterecommendations on the need to stem illicit arms flows toand in Africa.Apart from these concerns  we have certain groundsfor satisfaction. Disarmament took a step forward veryrecently with the adoption of the Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction  which I personally signed on behalf ofGabon on 4 December 1997 in Ottawa  and which hasjust entered into force with the deposit of the fortiethinstrument of ratification by an African country  BurkinaFaso.Other significant instruments  such as the ChemicalWeapons Convention and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  have become a reality. Gabon convinced of the prominent role of disarmament in themaintenance of international peace and security  is asignatory of these important instruments. My countryinvites all States Members of the United Nations to worktowards complete and general disarmament in the twenty-first century  the guarantor of a lasting peace. We mustmake the quest for peace a cardinal point of reference.However  that peace will remain in jeopardy as longas the basic needs of peoples are not met. The persistenceof conflicts  non-respect for the human person  hatred andthe rejection of democratic values all have seriousrepercussions on the economic health of States. Likewise the phenomenon of refugees and displaced persons epidemics and the cost of reconstruction in the wake ofwar all are burdens that affect already fragile economiesand aggravate difficult social situations.The situation at this end of century makes itimperative for the international community to deal withdevelopment and social issues if we wish to prevent ourworld from self-destructing. The content of the 1998Human Development Report  published by the UnitedNations Development Programme a few weeks ago strengthens this conviction. The conclusions of the 1995Copenhagen summit therefore remain valid  and theUnited Nations must again take the initiative.Statements of intention no longer suffice. We needconcrete action and realistic programmes that take intoaccount the phenomenon of globalization. These27programmes must ensure that no one is excluded and thateach of our nations  by making the necessary efforts toadapt  can become integrated in the most harmonious waypossible. That is why Gabon believes it necessary torelaunch the idea of a new partnership based on fairness inorder to respond to the legitimate aspirations of people —mainly  to eliminate poverty and to promote well-being.With globalization  States? autonomy and room formanoeuvre has been greatly reduced. The power ofGovernments is offset by the power of the markets.Openness and freedom  however  must not come to meanfree rein to establish the law of the jungle  in which we  thesmall and the weak  will inevitably be crushed anddestroyed.In this context  it seemed necessary to the Governmentof Gabon not to abdicate but to refocus the role of theState. A new direction has been reflected  inter alia through an ambitious programme of liberalization ofeconomic activities on the one hand and on the other by theprivatization of large sectoral public enterprises.As for the structure of the economy of Gabon  let mesay that our country remains dependent on the sale of threeprincipal raw materials: oil  wood and manganese. Theprices of these products have been on the decline forseveral months now. If we factor in the fluctuations in theUnited States dollar  which is also on the decline  we cansee that the result is a decrease in the income of the State which puts the country?s investment and developmentcapacities in considerable jeopardy.This fact is not the only handicap to my country?sdevelopment. The debt and its servicing absorb almost 45per cent of our budgetary resources. This is trulyintolerable.All of this notwithstanding  the international financialinstitutions continue to classify Gabon as an upper middle-income country  thus preventing its access to financing onflexible terms. Gabon is the only sub-Saharan Africancountry in this situation  which is simply unjust.Gabon  a developing country just like any other  asksthat international financial institutions apply new assessmentcriteria and  above all  that they give more appropriateconsideration to our debt burden in order further to unleashour productive capabilities. This would benefit not only thepeople of Gabon but also our partners abroad.Other major problems must also mobilize theinternational community  inter alia  the drug problem terrorism  major pandemics  human rights and theenvironment.The General Assembly held its twentieth specialsession on the fight against drugs last June. Gabon ispleased that on that occasion our Organization enshrinedthe criminal nature of the traffic in drugs and broadenedthe options for solutions to this scourge at the globallevel. That session gave political impetus to theinternational efforts of States in the fight against drugtrafficking  which now spares no country. TheGovernment of Gabon invites the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies to further support the efforts made inthis respect at the regional level.As for the scourge of terrorism  and bearing in mindthe horrible attacks in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam  I mustfirst of all pay a tribute of compassion and respect to thememory of the Kenyan  Tanzanian and American citizenswho lost their lives there. I express my deepest sympathyto all of those persons who were wounded. Above all  theGovernment of Gabon most forcefully reaffirms itscondemnation of acts of terrorism in all theirmanifestations  wherever they may occur. We believe thatno cause can justify resorting to such acts. But I alsodenounce certain retaliatory measures that they inspire  inparticular the placing of countries that are suspected ofinvolvement under embargo. This type of response isneither appropriate nor efficient. In most cases  thosetypes of measures affect mainly innocent civilianpopulations.We believe  therefore  that under the auspices of theUnited Nations  urgent dialogue must be undertaken toexplore ways and means of preventing and combatingterrorism.In the field of human rights  Gabon welcomes thecreation of an International Criminal Court  as establishedby the Statute adopted at Rome on 17 July last. The sameapplies to the Organization of African Unity Protocol which created  at the organization?s thirty-fourth summit a Pan-African Court of Justice.Because of industrial development  environmentalquestions have become an increasingly pressing concernfor the international community. The awareness to whichthe Rio Summit gave rise unfortunately was not followedup by the concrete measures that were expected.Commitments have not been fulfilled  and as time goes28by  the Rio consensus must lead us more than ever towardsa necessary commitment if we wish to avoid its remaininga dead letter.I should like also to take this opportunity to expressmy delegation?s satisfaction with  and its support for  theefforts made by the International Seabed Authority  theguarantor of a common heritage of humankind  in theconsideration of a draft code on the mining  exploration andexploitation of the seabed.We must make sincere and tireless efforts on all ofthese major issues. I very much appreciate the work of ourOrganization  which  through its executing bodies  itsspecialized agencies and with the support of otherorganizations  is making every effort to achieve these nobleobjectives.As I already said last year  Gabon supports the ideathat the United Nations system needs rational and consistentrenewal  in keeping with today?s realities. The proposals ofthe Secretary-General on the reform of the budgetary administrative  social and economic sectors reflect a spiritof innovation that will make it possible to face thechallenges of the new millennium.More specifically  as regards the thorny question ofthe expansion of the Security Council  Gabon is  of course in favour of it. We believe Africa should have twopermanent seats — I repeat  two permanent seats — whichwould be occupied on a rotational basis by all Africancountries — I repeat  all African countries — in accordancewith modalities to be determined by them.Before concluding  allow me to commend theachievements of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We knowhis task is immense and difficult. He has alreadyaccomplished a great deal  with courage and skill. I havealready mentioned the promising views he shared with theSecurity Council on the eradication of conflicts and thepromotion of lasting peace in Africa. For Africa  and forthe entire international community  we must encourage andsupport him."
"61",2540,"GBR",53,1998,"Today’s world offersone clear lesson: to survive and prosper  we have to worktogether better. That much is clear.We share a global environment. We depend on eachother for development and prosperity. Regional conflictsaffect us all. Our peoples suffer together under theshadows of drugs and terrorism.We can no longer separate what we want to achievewithin our own borders from what we face across ourborders. Rapid change of the sort we have seen recentlycan inspire fear. But we must face and conquer that feartogether.And if our finance  our trade  media communications and even our culture are  day by day more and more transnational  it would be strange andpotentially dangerous if our politics remained locked inthe old compartments built just after the Second WorldWar. If the challenge is international  then the responsemust be international too. We must launch a new era ofinternational partnership in which we modernize thoseinstitutions that allow us to cooperate and to worktogether.The United Nations has a real record ofachievement. That is true. But it is true also that it hashad its failures. It has stood by or intervened ineffectivelywhen brutality was abroad. It has sometimes deliveredwords when action was needed.But the United Nations is no more than its MemberStates. Its failures are our failures. The values of theUnited Nations Charter are as valid now as when theywere written. But we have to find new ways of applyingthem.So I believe in the United Nations  but I also believeit must modernize  and do so urgently. All parts of theUnited Nations need proper accountability to go withsecure funding  better management and more effectivecoordination in all their activities.Our Secretary-General has given us a lead. But it isnow up to us  the Member States  to give him our fullsupport. We must not allow reform in the United Nationsto falter.And let me emphasize today that we need tostrengthen too the authority of the Security Council. Thismeans broadening its composition: new permanentseats — for the developing world as well as for Germanyand Japan. More non-permanent seats alone would be anunacceptable compromise. We have been talking aboutthis now for five years. It is time for decisions.28We face many challenges  but none more immediatethan the contagion of recession spreading from thosecountries currently in difficulty to affect the wider worldeconomy. The solutions do not lie in misguided attempts toimpose new panoplies of controls on international capitalmovements  or in a retreat from open trade. Rather  wemust all recognize that the absence of proper financialstructures and disciplines in individual countries  coupledwith a lack of transparency  will be punished by themarkets sooner or later.However  we can act. We can devise new mechanismsto support a process of change: rules to encourage greatertransparency in international and national financial dealings;better supervision and regulation of financial operators;adequate resources for the international financial institutionsto deal with short-term liquidity problems; structural reformprogrammes for countries in difficulty  programmes thattake account of the social effects of the restructuring we areasking for.The only way to tackle such complex problems is anew  high-level  international collaborative effort. Globalproblems will require global solutions. As Chairman of theG-8  Britain will play our full part in ensuring the necessarylook at the international financial architecture and how itcan be improved for a new age. This is a priority  I believe for us all.However  we know that  unlike in the 1950s  thiscannot be left simply to a few developed countries. Gettingthe financial framework right is only a start. We mustcreate the conditions for sustainable development in all ourcountries.The international community has set itself exactingtargets. Most important is the target to halve the proportionof people living in abject poverty by the year 2015. Ourown development effort is now geared to the eradication ofpoverty. I told last year’s special session that we wouldreverse the decline in our development assistance. Recentlywe have announced that we are raising our developmentbudget by £1.6 billion  and our support for health education and water projects in Africa by 50 per cent. Wehave helped pay for the World Health Organization’scampaign to roll back malaria. We are trying to put ourmoney where our mouth is.Of course  however  these development programmesonly work if the conditions are right  and too much moneyhas been wasted over the years. That is again why the workthe United Nations is doing to create strong developmentpartnerships is so important and must be given our fullbacking. I call today on all parts of the United Nationssystem  including the Bretton Woods institutions and theWorld Trade Organization  to give top priority to effectivecoordination of their development efforts. The poor ofthis world will otherwise be the losers.If we want to eradicate poverty  we also need toensure that the least developed countries benefit from thisglobal economy. That means  for example  letting themsell their goods without imposing tariffs on them. Itmeans actively helping them benefit from globalization.And it means rejecting any false allure of protectionism.The European Union is committed to zero tariffs forthese countries by the year 2000. And I would urge alldeveloped countries to follow suit.We also have to ease the debt burden on the poorestcountries. Britain has proposed the Mauritius Mandate tospeed up assistance for those in the debt trap who aregenuinely ready to help themselves out of it. By the year2000 all qualifying highly indebted countries should haveembarked on a systematic process of debt reduction  withthe aim of a permanent exit from their debt problems. Butwe need to make sure it happens. Again  a hugecollaborative effort between the countries represented heretoday will be needed.Development must not be at the expense of theenvironment. We all know this. But  again  this is achallenge to us. The success of Kyoto was a close-runthing. Buenos Aires will be hard work  but it has to work.Countries with the biggest emissions must come forwardquickly with credible plans to meet their Kyotocommitments. We in Britain will shortly publish aconsultation paper on how we will meet our obligations.And I hope that others will come forward and do thesame.The world has high expectations of the UnitedNations as the guardian of global peace and security. TheUnited Nations should not get involved if regionalorganizations are better able to tackle a local conflict. Butsometimes we must demonstrate collective global will.And if we act  we must act decisively. Clear principlesmust be our guiding hand. Let me set some out briefly.First  prevention is always better than cure. Theresources spent on averting conflict are tiny compared tothe expense of peacekeeping once the guns start to fire.The United Nations is building up its capacity in this29area  but it needs more support — and again Britainpledges to play its part.Secondly  where we do have to send in the BlueHelmets  they should be given a clear and achievable task.There must be no repeat of Bosnia  where peacekeeperswere inserted into a live conflict and told to make safeareas safe. But they were not given the means to do so.United Nations peacekeepers need a way out as wellas a way in. They must have the tools to do the job  andclear and effective command.Thirdly  the United Nations needs to be able to act andrespond fast. Fast action can prevent a conflict escalating underpin a fragile truce  save lives. Again  we in Britain aretrying to play our part. The reshaping of Britain’s armedforces following our Strategic Defence Review istransforming our ability to contribute to peacekeeping andhumanitarian operations: more and better equipped rapid-reaction forces  additional strategic lift and better logisticscapability.I can announce today that within six months we willconclude a specific agreement with the United Nations toensure that it can make rapid use of what we have to offerwhen it is needed — the first such agreement by apermanent member.Fourthly  peacekeeping has to be accompanied fromthe start by peace-building  to restore justice  democraticinstitutions  prosperity and human rights. The SecurityCouncil has to deal with the symptoms of conflict  notsimply with its causes. It needs to work with the rest of theUnited Nations  the World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund if it is to have lasting impact. Again  I willbe asking the Secretary-General to put to us new proposalsdealing with the consequences and the causes of conflict tomake this a reality.Too many of those conflicts sill abound. There are fewhigher priorities than restoring peace to the Great Lakesregion. The Middle East peace process remains an apparentdeadlock. We have managed to make progress in NorthernIreland  and the support of the world community in ourdoing so has given us great strength and courage to carryon. We owe a debt of gratitude for that support  and I hopethat the world will continue it. I believe now is the time fora further move forward in the Middle East  too. Again  wein Britain are ready to play our part in bringing this about.I want to focus  however  on one other area ofurgent concern: Kosovo. It almost defies belief that  yetagain  the security forces of President Milosevic´ areignoring the clear will of the international community andinflicting brutality and repression on those they claim tosee as fellow citizens. Of course  we recognize that theunacceptable actions of the so-called Kosovo LiberationArmy have contributed to the present appalling situation.But nothing can justify scorched-earth tactics and forciblecreation of hundreds of thousands of refugees.We have some clear responsibilities in this situationas an international community. First  we must make itclear that our patience with broken promises — phoneyassurances that are not honoured — is exhausted.Continuation of military repression will inevitably lead toa new kind of response. Secondly  we must impress onboth sides the need to negotiate  with a realisticappreciation of what is possible  and point the way to amutually acceptable solution. Thirdly  we must make itclear that we have to meet the immediate humanitarianneeds of the refugees in Kosovo and prevent  by anymeans necessary  the humanitarian disaster which we cansee just over the horizon as winter approaches.We propose a new Security Council resolutioncalling for an immediate ceasefire and demanding anurgent end to the trampling of the rights of the inhabitantsof Kosovo. It should be adopted this week  and PresidentMilosevic´ would ignore such a resolution at his peril.The international community faces another seriouschallenge in Iraq. The Security Council is unanimous ininsisting that Iraq resume cooperation with the UnitedNations  and Kofi Annan courageously reached animportant agreement with the Iraqi leadership about theUnited Nations Special Commission earlier this year.Again  this agreement has to be honoured  and we willplay our part in ensuring that it is.Finally  we face two global scourges which canundermine our institutions and  indeed  our way of life:drugs and terrorism. We all know the growing linksbetween drugs and crime and instability in so manycountries. The insidiously corrupting effect drugs have onall who come near them — growers  smugglers  pushersand users alike. We have  as we know  to tackle everylink of the drugs chain  but we are in danger of losingsight of the size of the mountain we have to climb. If weare honest with ourselves  this is a war that we are riskinglosing  but we must win. Britain  again  is spending a30further £200 million at the national level on our priorities but our collective efforts need a much stronger focus.We are not short of organizations looking at thisproblem; indeed  there may well be too many. But we aredesperately short of results: cutting supply lines  eliminatingillicit crop cultivation and stopping the profits of the drugdealers. We have a new instrument  the convention againstorganized crime. Too many countries still provide sanctuaryfor the proceeds of crime. We must demand together thatthose countries root out the traffickers and their dirtymoney — hit the drug barons where it hurts. Theconvention will provide practical means to achieve this  butthe negotiations are dragging. Let us set ourselves the taskof completing them by the millennium  at the latest.The fight against terrorism has also taken on a newurgency. The past year’s global roll-call of terror includesLuxor  Dar-es-Salaam  Nairobi  Omagh and many others.Each one is a reminder that terrorism is a uniquely barbaricand cowardly crime. Each one is a reminder that terroristsare no respecters of borders. Each one is a reminder thatterrorism should have no hiding place and noopportunity to raise funds  and that there should be nolet-up in our determination to bring its perpetratorsjustice. This applies to the new phenomenon of statelessterrorism as much as to its more familiar forms.As a start  it is surely vital that all countries sign upto the 11 international conventions to ensure that terroristshave no safe haven. We have ourselves  again  in Britain just passed new legislation to ensure we can tackleterrorist conspiracies aimed at third countries. But wemust go further. We can hope to defeat terrorism only ifwe all devote ourselves to doing so. So I welcome therecent initiative by the President of France to tackle fund-raising for terrorism on an international basis. AsChairman of the G-8  I again offer today to host a high-level conference in London this autumn to deny theterrorists this means of support. Effective new measureson an agreed international basis could make a realdifference.I have covered many points in my speech to theAssembly  but my main point is really a very simple one.We face multiple new challenges as we approach the newcentury. Our only hope  as we all know  of tackling thesechallenges successfully is tackling them together. Weneed effective international cooperation and moderninstitutions to deal with our political problems and oureconomic problems. We need the United Nations systempulling together as never before. We need to revitalizeand modernize our international institutions to deal withthe crisis in the global economy. But  above all  we needpolitical will and a sense of urgency. The problems of ourmodern world are too pressing  their consequences tooimmediate  their impact too far-reaching for us to hesitateor to look away any longer. We are being given awarning to act  to give purpose and direction in resolvingthese challenges we face together  or pay the price. Andthe time to do it — to respond to that warning — is now."
"62",2564,"GEO",53,1998,"Allow me at theoutset to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs ofUruguay  Mr. Didier Opertti  on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. Thisdecision  to which Georgia acceded with pleasure  is afitting recognition of Uruguay’s high internationalauthority and a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Opertti’spersonal qualities and profound experience.At the same time  I am honoured to have theopportunity to express my gratitude to the President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine  for his significantcontributions to the successful outcome of the previoussession.Today  as the second millennium is coming to aclose  an inevitable question pops up: What will the next the third  millennium be like? Indeed  for the first timesince the end of the global stand-off  the opportunity hasemerged to create a qualitatively new world order based14upon the comprehensive development of free andindependent States. Allow me to share our observations onsome of the important issues that we face.We have repeatedly underscored the threat to globalstability posed by the spread of the disease of aggressiveseparatism and the ineffectiveness of our joint efforts tocope with it. For five years now  the conflict in Abkhazia Georgia  has been on the agendas of a number ofinternational forums. The need to resolve this conflictwithin the framework of the territorial integrity of Georgiaand to ensure the speedy return of hundreds of thousands ofrefugees and displaced persons has been reiterated morethan once. However  we have to admit that real progresstowards the settlement of this conflict has not beenaccomplished.Moreover  in May 1998  as a result of the punitiveoperation carried out by the Abkhaz side in the Gali regionof Abkhazia  Georgia  more than 60 civilians were killed about 1 400 houses burned and over 40 000 peacefulcivilians expelled once again from their land. The vigorousefforts of the Georgian Government at that point avertedfull-scale confrontation and bloodshed.The tragedy in the Gali region was preceded by theunfulfilled resolutions of the Security Council and bydecisions on the “ethnic cleansing” of the Georgianpopulation in Abkhazia  Georgia  adopted at the Budapestand Lisbon summits of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE). Thus  we are once againconfronted by the acute problem of the implementation ofdecisions taken by the international community.The Government of Georgia remains committed to apeaceful solution of the conflict and applies only politicalmeans  to which there is no reasonable alternative. In orderto add new impetus to the peace process  we havewelcomed the creation and development of the Genevaprocess  under the auspices of the United Nations and withthe participation of the Russian Federation as facilitator  theFriends of the Secretary-General and the OSCE. Moreactive work should be conducted in the framework of theGeneva process on the question of the political status ofAbkhazia within the Georgian State.In our view  it is urgent to fully resume thefunctioning of the United Nations Observer Mission inGeorgia and  in accordance with its mandate  to ensure thefreedom of its activities.The matter of utmost importance is the safety ofUNOMIG personnel in the conflict zone. Theirvulnerability was again proved by the recent armed attackagainst four members of UNOMIG in Sukhumi.In this regard  we wish to emphasize the importanceof the proposal of the Secretary-General concerning thedeployment of self-protection units. Unfortunately  thisquestion has turned into a subject of endless discussion.Indeed  it is unclear how the deployment of a self-protection unit would contradict the interests of any of theparties to the conflict or any other State  when this stepis intended only to facilitate UNOMIG’s intensivemonitoring and would contribute to peace in the region.While categorically condemning terrorist acts regardless of the motives or where these acts might comefrom  we support the creation of joint investigative teamswith clearly defined mandates of action.The turn of events in Abkhazia  Georgia  has shownthat some important aspects should be touched upon. Firstamong these is the development of economic programmesof post-conflict peace-building to promote the peaceprocess. We already have an example of the successfulimplementation of such an approach in the settlement ofthe Georgian-Ossetian conflict. The implementation of theeconomic programme in close cooperation with theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR) has brought about the realization ofa number of important projects for the reconstruction ofthe social and economic infrastructure in the conflict zoneand  most importantly  has activated the mechanism of thereturn of refugees to their homes. Recently  we haveembarked upon the implementation of the subsequentstage of the programme  which has been financed by theEuropean Union.Secondly  for the success of the peace process  wedeem it necessary to formulate and effectively implementconfidence-building measures between the parties to theconflict. To this end  and for the implementation of themeasures formulated and the coordination of work in thisdirection  we believe it would be reasonable to activelyengage the joint United Nations-Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe Human Rights Office inSukhumi.The third aspect is the grave humanitarian situationexisting in internal conflicts  such as the one in Abkhazia Georgia. I refer to the fate of hundreds of thousands of15refugees and internally displaced persons. We regret thatthe rights of the internally displaced persons are notprotected by an international act.President Shevardnadze has called upon the worldcommunity to mark 1998  the year of the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by elaborating a comprehensive plan for the creation of aneffective international mechanism for the protection of therights of internally displaced persons throughout the world including their political rights  the right to protect theirproperty and the right to return to their homes. In thisregard  we actively support the proposal of the Secretary-General concerning the creation of an organizationalstructure for the protection of the rights of displacedpersons.When discussing the creation of a global model ofsecurity for the twenty-first century  we have to admit thatthe post-confrontational world is not yet secure  and theproblem of separatism is not the only threat against whichwe have to consolidate our efforts.We cannot but express our concern over the expansionof the zone of nuclear proliferation. The nuclear tests inSouth Asia have clearly made this threat far more ominous.Therefore  we call upon all States to display goodwill anda commitment to peace  and to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.Efforts to quell the hotbeds of the so-called localconflicts have so far been unsuccessful. Georgia is deeplyconcerned at the developments in Kosovo  and especially inthe north Caucasus region  namely  in Chechnya  Dagestanand across the border of North Ossetia and Ingushetia.Terrorism  with all its bloody manifestations  poses athreat both to the region and to the world as a whole.Unfortunately  Georgia has also had its fair share ofterrorism. The assassination attempt against the President ofGeorgia was aimed at the destabilization of the country andof the entire region. These and the recent terrorist actsagainst the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzaniarequire an intensification in the fight against terrorism.Therefore  we must actively support any efforts to do awaywith this evil.As we usher in the next millennium  it is impossiblenot to touch upon the problems of economic developmentand economic security. The process of economicglobalization raises the question of a new role for theUnited Nations as a universal institution which wouldeffectively contribute to the development of nationaleconomies and ensure economic security at both theregional and the global level.All this is especially urgent for the post-Communistcountries with economies in transition. Since restoring itsstatehood in 1991  Georgia has been on a difficult road having gone from chaos to stability and from totaleconomic collapse to development. This became possiblethrough democratic change and economic reforms.We have come to believe that the successfultransition of the newly independent States to the marketeconomy depends entirely on their integration into theinternational economic system through regional andinterregional cooperation. A clear example of theimplementation of a large-scale programme of economiccooperation is the revival of historic Silk Road. TheSummit of the Transport Corridor: Europe-Caucasia-Asia(TRACECA) member States  held recently at Baku Azerbaijan  emphasized that the idea of an alternativeroadway for the Central Asian region through the southCaucasian corridor has already turned into a significantsystem stretching across the whole Euro-Asian continent.The economic cooperation of the Black Sea basincountries is also very important. This area was recentlytransformed into a regional economic organization  havingimpressive potential and far-reaching plans.In the course of the formation of a new world order the main responsibility for international peace andsecurity rests with the United Nations. An important stepwould be the reform of the Security Council inaccordance with the new geopolitical realities. In thisregard  we reiterate our position concerning the inclusionof Germany and Japan among the permanent members ofthe Council. We also support the increase in the numberof non-permanent seats  providing one for the States ofthe Eastern European region. We also advocate moretransparency in the work of the Security Council including participation in its closed meetings by thosenon-member States whose problems happen to be thesubject of the Council’s discussions.We are aware of the importance the United Nationsattaches to the timely contributions of its Member States.In this regard  despite its economic constraints  Georgiawill do everything in its capacity to cover its indebtednessto the Organization.16Special attention should be accorded to the furtherdevelopment of United Nations peacekeeping operations.We believe that the time has come to further developand institutionalize the system of standby arrangements.The creation of the Multinational United Nations StandbyForces High-Readiness Brigade can play an important rolein preserving the peace. The same is true of theestablishment of a well-equipped headquarters from whichto identify potential hotbeds of tension.Georgia has always advocated the establishment of anInternational Criminal Court and actively participated in theRome Conference. We believe that the establishment of thispermanent jurisdictional body will ensure that grossviolations of human rights and crimes against humanity nolonger go unpunished.Like many previous speakers  in my statement I haveresorted to such expressions as “new challenges” and “newthreats” in the post-confrontational world. But at the sametime  the new era opens before us new and boundlesshorizons and creates new opportunities in the formation ofa new world order. We believe that only by joint effortsand common political will can we cope with thesechallenges and realize all these opportunities."
"63",2611,"GHA",53,1998,"Thank you very much  Sir. But Iprefer to be called â€œFlight-Lieutenantâ€ and not â€œMr.â€I join preceding speakers in congratulating thePresident and the other members of the Bureau on yourelection to direct the affairs of the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly. I am indeed very confident that underyour wise leadership the outcome of our deliberations willconstitute a great step forward in our efforts to build a newworld which meets the aspirations of our peoples in thesearch for peace  justice and prosperity.May I also avail myself of this opportunity to expressthe deep appreciation of my delegation for the remarkableachievements of Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  under whoseable guidance the Assembly at the preceding session tookvery important decisions on United Nations reformintended to prepare the Organization for the immensechallenges ahead as we move into the twenty-firstcentury.In these laudable efforts  we also recognize the boldinitiatives and drive of our Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  whose vision for the future of the United Nations corresponding so much with that of the generalmembership and the peoples of the world  facilitated thecontinuing process of reform. We in Ghana and indeed inAfrica are proud to have for a son a man of his statureand drive.The commemoration this year of the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsaffords us the opportunity to take stock of what has beenachieved over the years and map out well-definedstrategies to improve the quality of life of our peoples  byeffectively promoting and protecting their fundamentalrights  which the Declaration holds as a common standardof achievement for all people and all nations.Womenâs rights must be at the centre of that processand we should remain focused on their worldwidepromotion and protection. It is their right. It is ourobligation. The work of the United Nations instrengthening the equal status and the human rights ofwomen  from the World Conference on Human Rights tothe Fourth World Conference on Women  is indeedcommendable.Almost fifty years after the adoption of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  12 million children underfive years of age die every year from preventablediseases  200 million children under five years of age areundernourished and 110 million are denied basiceducation. Eight hundred million people have no accessto the most basic health services  and 1.3 billion humanbeings live in abject poverty around the world. This stateof affairs persists because of the inequitable internationaleconomic system which discriminates against adeveloping world  particularly Africa.The persistent critical economic situation in Africashould be of great concern to the international communityand should prompt us all to take effective and urgentmeasures to address its underlying causes. Many of ourcountries  particularly the poorer ones  continue to sufferfrom a heavy debt burden and crippling debt-servicing4obligations  which  by diverting resources away fromdevelopment  prevent us from providing adequate socialservices to our populations in basic areas such as educationand health and therefore reduce our capacity to compete inthe global market.In this regard  we stress the need for debt-reliefmeasures to be accompanied by concessional financialassistance  particularly to the least developed countries  withthe aim of enhancing the implementation of economicreforms and creating a stable environment that enablescountries to extricate themselves from the debt overhang.The international reverberations of the recent financialturmoil in Asia and elsewhere  I believe  point to the futilityof any notions that any nation can play outside the rules that any nation in this world can stand alone.In my view  the present approach of certainindustrialized countries who require developing countries toadhere to standards or policies which they themselves donot observe  or seem unable to observe  will severely testrelations between the developed and the developingcountries in the next century.We must stand together if we are not to jeopardize theprosperity enjoyed by hundreds of millions today and thehopes of billions more for a life of dignity and a healthymeasure of comfort â€” nothing more  nothing less.The new times we live in require new ideas suitableto the dynamics of today. Policy makers and opinionleaders in the developed countries bear great responsibilityin this regard  as we all do  for providing very clearleadership of integrity. Much is demanded of thosecountries that share a great part of the blame for the presentstate of the world  as they no doubt have the means to beable to provide what it takes.Even though it had been clear for some time thatsustainable development around the globe could not beachieved without a measure of fairness in economicrelations between North and South  because of short-termconsiderations of profit and advantage  the countriesbenefiting from the unjust economic order chose to ignorethe serious impact of that situation on living standards inmost parts of the world as well as in limiting worldeconomic growth.Instead  we received sermons on the truths  realitiesand moralities of life  and countries and peoples werevictimized if they were shown not to have lived up toexpectations. That was the price  in other words  that wehad to pay. It was obvious  however  that whenever asituation required moral leadership from the capitals ofthose countries which preached morality in the first place that morality manifested itself as no more than nationalinterest.No one questions the need for States to look out fortheir national interests. However  it is the blindness to theneed for enlightened self-interest that has lain at the heartof the divisions between our States for so long  and whichhas finally shaken the economic confidence of people whether in the North or the South  in recent times.The end of the cold war has unleashed new threatsto global and regional peace. Intra-State conflicts  rootedin ethnic  racial and religious intolerance  pose a threat tothe security of many States and regions. The tardiness andselectivity of the international community in dealing withsome of these conflict situations have been ratherdisturbing  as they have undermined the concept ofcollective security enshrined in our noble Charter. Article24 of the Charter not only confers â€œprimaryresponsibilityâ€ for the maintenance of international peaceand security on the Security Council  but also calls forâ€œprompt and effective actionâ€ when a breach occurs.However  in our part of the world  we often ask ourselveswhere the â€œprompt and effectiveâ€ action of the Councilwas when Rwanda was on fire. Where was the Councilwhen Liberia was in turmoil? Where was the â€œprompt andeffective actionâ€ when the people of Sierra Leoneagonized under the yoke of a brutal dictatorship?In the face of the selectivity of the Security Councilin dealing with issues of international peace and security and in spite of our regionâs meagre resources  we havehad to rely on our own efforts to respond to internal strifein some of the countries in our neighbourhood. We callon the Governments of those countries to remain steadfastin making sacrifices and doing everything possible tobring about national reconciliation  peace and stability.The international situation continues to be poisonedby unilateral economic  commercial and financialsanctions  which in some cases even have extraterritorialconsequences.We have seen such actions undermine the positivesocio-economic gains made by Cuba over the last fewdecades  with the resultant deprivation of an entirepopulationâs human rights and dignity. The world standsto gain from a peaceful solution to the differencesbetween the United States and Cuba  and we call on the5United States to settle its differences with Cuba throughnegotiations on the basis of equality and mutual respect.We are equally concerned by the effect of theimposition of sanctions by the Security Council against theLibyan Arab Jamahiriya. However  we are extremelypleased with the recent developments concerning thepossible trial of the two suspects in the bombing of PanAm flight 103 over Lockerbie.We call upon the United Kingdom  the United Statesof America and the Netherlands to engage in discussionswith the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  directly or through theSecretary-General of the United Nations  to arrive at trialarrangements which will offer appropriate safety measuresfor the two suspects.On Western Sahara  we call on the Security Counciland the Secretary-General to continue their efforts for apeaceful and just solution to the persistent outstandingdifferences and for a free and fair referendum. We will nothave a neighbouring African country recolonized by anotherAfrican country.Ghana shares the concerns and frustrations of theinternational community on the deadlock over the MiddleEast peace process. We believe that initiatives taken so farin support of the process  including the Madrid and theOslo agreements  as well as the principle of land for peace are an adequate basis for a just and long-lasting settlement.The international community is unanimous in itsdetermination to see a just peace in the Middle East  andthe Palestinian question no doubt holds the key.My delegationâs condemnation of all forms andmanifestations of terrorism and mercenary practices isrooted no doubt in their tragic consequences on the politicalstability as well as the economic and social development ofStates. Terrorist acts  in particular  are totally unacceptableas a means of seeking redress for any grievance  achievingpolitical ends or supporting a cause. It is in this connectionthat we have condemned the recent terrorist bomb attacksin Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam that claimed hundreds ofinnocent lives  injured thousands of people and causedmassive destruction to property  as well as the persistentthreat to Americans around the world.I am proud to say that since joining this Organizationon 8 March 1957  only two days after acceding toindependence  Ghana has remained true to its commitmentsto contribute to the promotion of international peace andsecurity  the principal raison dâÃªtre of this Organization.Only three years after independence  in 1960  my country Ghana  responded to the call of the Organization andcommitted troops and resources to the United Nationspeacekeeping operation in what was then the BelgianCongo  now the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of theCongo.We have since remained actively engaged consistently participating in the peace efforts of theOrganization  in all regions of the globe. As I speak Ghana is listed as one of the major contributors of troopsto United Nations peacekeeping efforts  with personnelserving in eight United Nations missions in Africa Europe  Asia and the Middle East.The Government and people of Ghana are indeedproud of our participation in these international peaceefforts  even though it has been at great expense to ourdeveloping country. It is not a sacrifice in materialresources alone  but also in human terms  as Ghana  aswell as her neighbours  has lost her sons and daughters inthese operations.We welcome the adoption last year of theConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction. My country was among the largenumber that signed the Convention in Ottawa lastDecember  and it is in the process of its early ratification.We hope that conditions will  in the not-too-distant future permit the Conventionâs universal adoption  to enable usto rid our planet of these inhumane weapons whichcontinue to kill and maim innocent civilians long after theconflicts in which they were laid. We are sincerely of theview that the international community should pay greaterattention to demining and rehabilitation  because of thehavoc that the presence of mines wreaks on theeconomies of the affected countries as well as on thecontribution of millions of peasants towards the feedingof their families.The United Nations Diplomatic Conference ofPlenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an InternationalCriminal Court  convened in Rome in June and July thisyear  is a welcome development in our collective effort toprovide a legal and institutional framework to holdperpetrators accountable for genocide  crimes againsthumanity  war crimes and serious violations ofinternational humanitarian law. It is our sincere hope thatthe spirit of compromise that led to the overwhelmingendorsement of the Rome treaty will similarly be broughtto bear on the work of the Preparatory Commission  toensure the early establishment of a fully functional andeffective court.6Once again Ghana has the unpleasant task of joiningothers to express concern at the financial situation thatpersists in the Organization  characterized by very littlecash and huge arrears. The persistent critical financialsituation places our Organization in jeopardy at this time ofreform. It is regrettable that a number of States are neitherpaying their assessed contributions nor making full paymentof their arrears  while some persistently aggravate thesituation by attaching unreasonable as well as unacceptableconditions or benchmarks to the discharge of their Charterobligations. In this respect  let me admit that there are verysmall but extremely rich countries among us who couldhave helped without making a dent in their national wealthand resources.Support for the United Nations must be demonstratednot in pious proclamations but in the willingness of allMember States to meet Charter obligations to theOrganization  including payment of our contributions toensure that the Organization is put on a sound financialfooting to tackle its mandates and pressing commitments.I wish to conclude by expressing once more mydelegationâs appreciation to the Secretary-General and tothe Assembly for the comprehensive reforms beingundertaken to restructure  revitalize and democratize theUnited Nations. I congratulate most sincerely the Secretary-General and the Assembly on their achievements so far.And I assure you that my delegation  my country  willcontinue to work with you in this reform process and in allaspects of the Organizationâs work in order to ensure thatthe Organization continues in the twenty-first century tobetter serve the global community and generations yet tocome in the maintenance and enhancement of our collectivesecurity and the promotion of international cooperation toadvance the economic and social well-being of all ourpeoples.That happens to be the vision of the founding fathersof the United Nations. And this is our commitment."
"64",2657,"GIN",53,1998,"On behalf of my delegation  I should first of all like tocongratulate Mr. Opertti warmly on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at this session. Mycountry  the Republic of Guinea  is pleased with thisexpression of confidence  eloquent proof of the internationalcommunity?s recognition of the very positive role played byhis country  Uruguay  in working for the noble ideals of ourOrganization. I am sure his personal qualities and greatexperience will ensure success at this session.I should also like to take this opportunity to conveyour great appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko President of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession  for the skill  open-mindedness and efficiency of hispresidency.I should also like to extend to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  the confidence of the Government ofGuinea  which greatly appreciates his perceptiveness  hisgreat wisdom and his hard work  which together areopening up new horizons for this Organization.Despite encouraging results in many areas  the UnitedNations still faces many challenges that threateninternational peace and security and jeopardize thesustainable development of nations. It is the responsibilityof the United Nations  in accordance with its purposes andprinciples  to become more involved in the enduring searchfor peace  so that the human race  on the eve of the thirdmillennium  can establish a real foundation for theprosperity of all States.How can one ensure peace and the harmoniousdevelopment of our States if the international communitywill not firmly commit itself to identifying and eradicatingthe deep causes of the many conflicts and imbalances thatcontinue to impede mankind?s progress towards greaterwell-being? At a time when we are preparing tocommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  the world?s conscience isstill troubled by the indifference of the major players inthe international arena in the search for appropriatesolutions to the challenges that face us all.In a number of countries  peoples and individuals aredeprived of fundamental rights. Civil wars continue tocause great suffering to innocent victims. It has beenshown that respect for fundamental rights  includingpromotion of the right to development  which underlies allother rights  is an excellent instrument of preventivediplomacy today.Our session is opening at a time when the MiddleEast peace process is completely deadlocked. My countryis following with great concern recent developments inthat part of the world  particularly in the Arab territoriesoccupied by Israel. My delegation is convinced that unlessthe rights of all the interested parties are taken intoaccount  peace will remain elusive.The search for peace in the Middle East is a matterof concern to all States  first and foremost the Statesmembers of the Organization of the Islamic Conference(OIC)  which on several occasions has called on theSecurity Council and the General Assembly for greaterUnited Nations involvement in achieving a just andlasting peace in the Middle East through the return of theoccupied Arab territories  the creation of a Palestinianstate and respect for the rights of all States in the regionto peace and security.My delegation appeals to all parties concerned particularly the authorities in Tel Aviv  to ensure strictimplementation of the Oslo and Washington agreements with a view to saving peace and thereby avoid the threatof another crisis that jeopardizes the balance in thesubregion and international peace as a whole.The African continent continues to be a centralconcern of the international community. There is no needfor me to enumerate the many internal conflicts that haveoccurred in Africa in recent years.In West Africa  the collective awareness of themember States of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) of the need to make oursubregion a zone of peace  security and stability has15contributed  thanks to the resolve shown by our heads ofState  to restoring peace in Liberia and has allowed for areturn to constitutionality in Sierra Leone.These achievements  which are the result of theunanimous desire of our peoples to manage their ownaffairs  also attest to the vitality of the institutions ofregional integration as instruments for conflict prevention management and resolution. Here  I would appeal to theinternational community for more cooperation with andassistance to the peacekeeping mechanisms initiated bysubregional organizations.There is a need to consolidate the great achievementsof the restoration of peace in Liberia and Sierra Leonethrough massive assistance for their speedy reconstruction the return of refugees and national reconciliation. If theyoung people who have been demobilized in these twocountries do not quickly find some activity in civilian life the temptation to return to disorder will remain. Tostrengthen peace and security in the West Africansubregion  the international community must help theeconomies of Liberia and Sierra Leone return to the path ofgrowth.While ECOWAS and the international communitywere seeking ways and means to consolidate peace inSierra Leone and Liberia  another conflict erupted on 7June 1998 in Guinea-Bissau. The Government of Guinea which has always advocated dialogue and consultation toresolve conflicts  expressed  from the beginning of thiscrisis  its grave concern because of the geographic historical  social and cultural ties uniting Guinea-Bissau andmy own country.The existence of a mutual defence assistance pact signed on 25 January 1980  and the explicit invitation bythe Guinea-Bissau?s democratically elected President President João Bernardo Vieira both justified the sending ofa Guinean contingent to Guinea-Bissau to preserveconstitutional order and help end the war. Faithful to ourpolicy of peace and dialogue  the Government of Guineahas been working since the beginning of this crisis in theECOWAS Committee of Seven to find a just  negotiatedsolution.We believe that complementary action by theEconomic Community of West African States and thecontact group of the Community of Portuguese-SpeakingCountries will make it possible for us to achieve theobjective of restoring peace and security in Guinea-Bissau.If we are to preserve the achievements ofdemocratization in Africa  the international communitymust adopt new  more binding legal instrumentsprohibiting any seizure of power by force and banishingthose responsible for such actions at the international regional and subregional levels. The implementation ofsuch measures will help to strengthen preventivediplomacy and to preserve peace and security within ourStates  with respect for fundamental human rights.I cannot end this section of my statement withoutmentioning the thorny issue of refugees and displacedpersons  who are the victims of these crises. My country the Republic of Guinea  because of its geographic locationamong three countries facing civil war  has of all thecountries in the world the highest proportion of refugeeswithin its territory. Over the last decade  Guinea has takenin more than 700 000 refugees  which is one tenth of ourpopulation. This massive and prolonged concentration ofpeople has had serious social  economic andenvironmental consequences in the areas of Guineaconcerned  and is weighing heavily on my country and itseconomy.I would like to reiterate here the appeal made by theGovernment of Guinea for substantial assistance  inaccordance with Security Council and ECOWASresolutions to help the Republic of Guinea bear theburden of these refugees. On behalf of the Government ofGuinea  I should like to express our gratitude to thoseStates that have already responded favourably to thisappeal.Concerned about the situation  the United NationsDepartment of Political Affairs and the United NationsDevelopment Programme organized a special meeting onthe Republic of Guinea on 9 and 10 July this year in NewYork. The Government of Guinea appreciated thiswelcome initiative by the Secretary-General. We greatlyappreciated the recognition by the internationalcommunity  through the United Nations system  of thegreat sacrifices made by the people of Guinea to help therefugees from neighbouring countries  and especially thewill of the United Nations system to mobilize resourcesto strengthen Guinea?s economic capacity and preserve itsstability  so that we can continue to be a small island ofpeace and prosperity.I should like to take this opportunity to urgemultilateral partners  all our partners  to continue topursue with us the activities undertaken in support ofGuinea  particularly in the area of the environment  which16has been seriously degraded by the long-term masspresence of refugees. The future of the water supplies ofWest Africa is at stake here.The Republic of Guinea is closely following recentdevelopments in the political situation in the Great Lakesregion  particularly the crisis in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo. My delegation is deeply concerned by the riskthat the conflict will spill over into the subregion. Weurgently appeal to all the parties to the conflict to call animmediate ceasefire and to respect the territorial integrity ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  in accordance withthe recommendations of the summit of heads of State of thesubregion held at Victoria Falls on 7 and 8 September thisyear.Promoting the right to development is part of theoverall search for greater prosperity for the human race.While tangible political progress has been made in Africaover the last decade  African States still face the challengeof development  indebtedness and the negative impact of aglobalization which is not yet fully understood.This terrible situation  aggravated by the negativeimpact of internal conflict  is significantly weakening ourStates and opening them up to new and dangerous forms offoreign greed. The implementation of a policy to graduallyreduce the imbalances between rich and developingcountries would contribute to the emergence of a trueglobal market by the creation of centres of development onall continents.Each country in the world should be given everyopportunity for development and helped to become part ofthe world trade system. Despite considerable efforts byAfrican countries towards political and economicrestructuring  and towards strengthening their credibility andmaking their economies more competitive  the economicsituation in Africa continues to be critical. If urgent andappropriate measures are not taken  the sacrifices made riskhaving been in vain.My Government has already undertaken far-reachingpolitical  economic and structural reforms and hopes thatspecial attention will be given to the situation in Africa. Weappeal to the international community and the developedcountries to continue to increase official developmentassistance. Sustained assistance to African countries willenable them to consolidate what they have already achievedand thereby to enter the next millennium with a greatersense of calm. In this respect  the Agenda for Developmentshould be strongly supported  with a view to its effectiveimplementation.The question of disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is still aconcern for my Government. While the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was a significantstep forward for the preservation of peace  recentdevelopments in the international arena require theinternational community as a whole to consider moredeeply the underlying causes of the nuclear arms race. Itseems clear that as long as imbalances and injustices arenot put right  the spectre of proliferation will continue tothreaten international peace.Countries that already possess nuclear weapons havea special responsibility for the preservation ofinternational peace and must shoulder their responsibilitiesby taking a more active part in strengthening preventionand peacekeeping mechanisms  resolving existing or latentconflicts  ensuring more equitable treatment for Statesinvolved in conflict and  finally  making a moresubstantial contribution to the development of lessfortunate nations.The Government of Guinea believes that onlygeneral and complete disarmament can prevent the risk ofproliferation. In the subregion of West Africa  the tradein small arms endangers the internal equilibrium of ourStates. Within the context of conflict prevention in WestAfrica  subregional cooperation is under way to eradicatethis scourge. We invite the other regions of Africa tosupport this initiative and to work to establish appropriatestructures in order to put an end to the illicit trade insmall arms and make Africa a zone of peace and security.The Republic of Guinea welcomes the adoption andsigning of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-PersonnelMines and on Their Destruction. The National Assemblyof Guinea has already ratified this important Conventionto show its support for the elimination of landmines which cause so much suffering to innocent victims.It is reassuring to note the greater awareness at theglobal level of the need to end drug-trafficking  whosemany consequences dangerously threaten the prosperity ofnations. The results of the recent world summit meetingon drugs will doubtless enable us to further refine ourmethods to combat the production  distribution  sale andconsumption of drugs  which are a real scourge.17The recent adoption in Rome of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court was a major milestone in theprogress of humankind towards the elimination of seriousviolations of humanitarian law committed duringinternational or internal conflicts.As our community prepares to enter the thirdmillennium  it is now more necessary than ever to adapt theUnited Nations to the requirements of international life. Thenew challenges facing us will require the adoption of new more appropriate arrangements to make the twenty-firstcentury one of peace  justice and prosperity within thecontext of an equitable partnership that is beneficial to allnations.My delegation is convinced that the United Nations isstill the melting pot in which all nations can make theirvoices heard in the search for just and lasting solutions totheir concerns. We therefore believe that the financialcapacity of the United Nations must be strengthened.Contributions must be paid on time and in accordance withthe established scale. To that end  we must  together review the way in which the United Nations systemfunctions with a view to adapting it to current and futurecircumstances.My delegation believes in the need for thedemocratization of the United Nations through therestructuring of its principal bodies  such as the SecurityCouncil  whose current membership reflects the state of theworld in 1945 and no longer corresponds to the political economic and social realities of the world today. Thereform of the principal bodies of our Organization mustenable all States to use their national capacities to seek andconsolidate international peace.My country is more committed than ever to thehonourable mission of our Organization as set forth in theCharter. Given the many challenges facing us  Guineabelieves in the need for all of us to work together tostrengthen and preserve humankind?s vision of justice freedom  peace and solidarity. That is what our peopleswould have us do."
"65",2696,"GMB",53,1998,"My delegation would like firstof all to congratulate the President on his assumption ofthe presidency for this session. We know full well thatthe tasks that lie ahead are indeed challenging  but we areconfident that with his vast experience and wisdom hewill discharge his responsibilities successfully. Whilst wewish him luck  let me also reassure him of the fullcooperation of our delegation at all times.In the same vein  we would also like to congratulatehis predecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for theadmirable manner in which he conducted the activities ofthe Assembly during the fifty-second session.My delegation is very proud of Mr. Kofi Annan  ourable Secretary-General  for the efficient manner in whichhe has been running the affairs of our Organization. Hisimpressive contributions in the field of preventivediplomacy  as amply demonstrated on numerousoccasions  are worthy of praise. Likewise  in the delicatebusiness of reforms he is equal to the task  for no soonerdid he assume office than he embarked on the reform ofthe United Nations. His success is our success  andtherefore we will lend him our full support in ourcommon endeavour to revitalize the Organization andmake it more relevant to the realities of these changingtimes.We in the Gambia have also been busy with thetransformation of our own society under the dynamic andenlightened leadership of President Yahya A. J. J.Jammeh  whose ideal it is to serve the youth and peopleof Africa by endeavouring to help them to realize their23aspirations for peace  stability and justice and progress insocio-economic development. Since we renewed our newdemocratic tradition  every effort is being made toconsolidate this process in an orderly way  mindful of thefact that better and lasting results will be achieved onlythrough a systematic approach.Moreover  cultivating democracy in the midst ofpoverty is not an easy task because democracy is  after all about participation. If the basic needs of the people are notsatisfied  they are simply not interested in any politicalprocess. Conscious of this hard reality  the Government ofPresident Jammeh quickly put in place a programme ofsocio-economic development to empower the people andtheir families  placing great emphasis on social sectors suchas health  education and agriculture. In this way  animpressive number of schools have been built around thecountry  and now we can boast of providing schools for allcommunities in the Gambia. Health facilities are withinreach of all Gambians and are also affordable.May I at this juncture  on behalf of my Government express our most sincere gratitude to the Governments ofthose friendly States — in particular  the Federal Republicof Nigeria  Cuba  Egypt and the Republic of China onTaiwan — for the medical assistance they continue to giveus during these times of need. This is a meaningful SouthSouth cooperation worthy of emulation.I am only attempting to share our perception of whatinter-State relations should be: caring  sharing  consultingand cooperating for the mutual benefit of all. I cannot thinkof a better way of cooperation between States for mutualeconomic development in a world in which the gap betweenthe rich and the poor continues to expand. Now  whilst weare concerned with bridging this gap  we are overwhelmedby another hurricane-like phenomenon  called globalizationand liberalization.Globalization and liberalization were recognized bymany to hold many attractions. They were perceived to bethe gateway to the integration of developing countries intothe global economy. We however observe that while theyare yielding ample benefits for developed countries  theyhave further widened the gap between developed anddeveloping countries  as well as the inequality gap betweenrich and poor. Their impact on employment and socioeconomic development in general has been largely negative.We are concerned at this growing marginalization ofthe least developed countries in world trade. The volume ofour total exports continues to be under 0.4 per cent ofglobal exports. Increased globalization is furtherworsening the situation. This negative trend meritscoordinated action to alleviate the situation. In thiscontext  we welcome the General Assembly’s decision tohold the first high-level dialogue for two days earlier thismonth on the theme of the social and economic impact ofglobalization and interdependence and their policyimplications. We hope that this meeting will have broughtabout active engagement of both developed anddeveloping countries  in a spirit of genuine partnership with a view to reaching a meaningful and successfulconclusion and strengthening international economiccooperation for development. Globalization andliberalization must be managed through concertedinternational effort in order to avoid the furthermarginalization of developing countries.The overwhelming burden of external debt todayposes one of the most challenging and daunting problemsfor developing countries. Much has been said about this and very little has been done to alleviate the problem. Webelieve that there is a dire need for new financial flows todebtor developing countries  in addition to debt reliefmeasures that include cancellation and concessionalfinancial assistance to enable developing countries toreduce their debt overhang.In this context  we welcome the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Initiative and encourage early and urgentapplication of its measures. We would also encourage anyrefinements of the initiative to reduce the structuraladjustment period to three years  to increase the debtreduction level to 90 per cent and to ease the terms forreduction of multilateral debt.The least developed countries have always receivedthe attention and support of the international community particularly with the adoption of the Paris Declaration andProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countriesfor the 1990s. The realization of the primary objectives ofthe Programme — to arrest and reverse the deteriorationin the socio-economic conditions in the least developedcountries — so far remains elusive. The lack of progressin this regard is attributable in the main to the failure ofthe international community to fulfil its commitments. Wehope that the declaration of the ministers of leastdeveloped countries at this year’s session will encourageour development partners to come forward and work withus in a genuine partnership.Poverty  deprivation and environmental degradationare the greatest evils facing developing countries today.24We agree with the analysis of the Secretary-General in hisreport on the causes of conflict and the promotion ofdurable peace and sustainable development in Africa  inparticular with regard to the interrelationship betweendevelopment and peace.Today  the world is besieged with conflicts  both interand intra-State. From the Balkans to the Great Lakesregion  human beings continue to prey on one another withguns and knives  machetes and all other sorts of weapons.Unfortunately  women and children suffer the most fromthese conflicts. We cannot continue to allow this to go on.The time has come when people have to take individualresponsibility for crimes they have committed againsthumankind. Ethnic violence and human rights abuses  acommon feature of present day conflicts  cannot becountenanced and cannot be committed with impunity.My delegation supports fully the resolve of theinternational community to deal with the problem  and inthis context welcomes the establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court. We share the philosophy of Benjamin B.Ferencz  a former Nuremberg prosecutor  that“there can be no peace without justice  no justicewithout law  and no meaningful law without a court todecide what is just and lawful under any givencircumstances”.The establishment of the International Criminal Courtwill ensure that henceforth humanity’s response to crimesagainst humanity will be swift and will be just. Henceforth no army  no ruler  no junta anywhere can abuse humanrights with impunity. The people and the Government ofthe Gambia look forward to the coming into effect of thestatute of the International Criminal Court.One of the most cherished aspirations of ourOrganization is to ensure that all men live in peace. Theattainment of international peace and security thereforeremains one of the most vital preoccupations of our nobleOrganization. It is for these reasons that my delegationjoins the rest of the international community in supportingthe efforts of the United Nations to ensure peace and theresolution of conflicts around the world.My delegation would like to take this opportunity tocommend the members of the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) and its Military ObserverGroup (ECOMOG) and other regional and subregionalarrangements in Africa and beyond for the good work theycontinue to do in their bid to ensure peace and security. Mydelegation is particularly thankful to ECOWAS for therestoration on 10 March 1998 of the legitimate andconstitutionally elected Government of Sierra Leone. Weare still concerned that the rebels have up to this momentrefused to lay down their arms. We urge the internationalcommunity to assist the Government of Sierra Leone inits effort to restore control over all its territory and toconcentrate its energies on national reconciliation reconstruction and economic development. In this regard my delegation welcomed the holding of the SpecialConference on Sierra Leone that was held here in NewYork at the initiative of the Secretary-General and whichwe hope will contribute to the process of nationalreconciliation.In neighbouring Guinea-Bissau  we hope that thejoint peace initiative of ECOWAS and the Community ofPortuguese Language Countries will bear fruit  leading toa final settlement of the dispute. In this context  werecognize the need to respect the ceasefire agreed upon inPraia  Cape Verde  on 26 August 1998  which weconsider to be an important step in enhancing peace andsecurity in the West African subregion.The Government of the Gambia is concerned overthe number  intensity and interrelationship amongconflicts in Africa  and especially at the emergence ofnew conflicts during the past year. The border conflictbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea  the resurgence of conflictin the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the impasse inthe peace process in Angola  the continued violence bythe rebels in Sierra Leone  and the complex humanitarianemergencies in Guinea-Bissau  Somalia and Sudan among other problems  cause grave concern to us.In addition to what I have just said  we are alsoconcerned at the difficulties attendant upon the presentconflict situations in Africa  in particular human rightsabuses  refugee outflows and the humanitarian needs ofinnocent persons affected by such conflicts  in particularwomen and children. The international community  inresponding to these conflict situations  must address theseissues and the root causes of the conflicts  including inparticular the troubling issues of children in armedconflict and the flow of small arms. In this context  mydelegation welcomes the actions taken by the SecurityCouncil to address these issues following the report of theSecretary-General on Africa. We hope that there will bea United Nations-wide approach to tackle these importantissues.25The Lockerbie issue has dragged on for too long. It isabout time that a settlement was reached so that the peopleof the great Libyan Arab Jamahiriya can be relieved of thebite of the excruciating sanctions imposed against them. Inaccordance with the position taken by the Organization ofAfrican Unity  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the League ofArab States and other regional organizations  theGovernment of the Gambia welcomes the concurrence ofthe Governments of the United Kingdom and of the UnitedStates of America to the proposal to have the twoLockerbie suspects tried in a neutral country  theNetherlands. Consequently  the Government of the Gambiareaffirms its full support for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya inits bid to secure a fair and just trial for the two suspects.In the light of the recent developments  in the quest toalleviate the immense suffering caused by the economicsanctions imposed on the Libyan nation by Security Councilresolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993)  and to avert anyfurther tightening of sanctions on the Libyan ArabJamahiriya  the Government of the Gambia is desirous ofthe urgent finalization of the arrangements for a lastingsolution to this long-drawn-out problem.Following a review  therefore  of the latestcorrespondence on the matter between the Governments ofthe United Kingdom and the United States of America andthe Secretary-General  and the agreement concludedbetween those two countries and the Government of theNetherlands relating to arrangements for the transfer of thesuspects to the Netherlands and their trial there  theGovernment of the Gambia is of the view that the LibyanArab Jamahiriya must be given the opportunity to make anassessment of those documents in order to ensure that itsviews and concerns are fully taken into consideration withregard to the final arrangements.Whilst acknowledging the great lengths that all partieshave gone to in order to ensure that justice is meted out —and this at the earliest possible opportunity — my countryfirmly believes that Libya should have a greater input intothe final arrangements regarding the hand-over of the twoLockerbie suspects and  most important  that the appropriateguarantees for a just and fair dispensation of justice shouldprevail. This would be in the spirit of the decision taken inOuagadougou by the heads of State of the Organization ofAfrican Unity at their last summit.My Government would like to see justice done and thereal culprits in the Lockerbie bombing identified andbrought to trial very quickly. However  whilst we persist inurging that Libya be associated fully in the quest formutually acceptable conditions of transfer of the twosuspects to the Netherlands and trial there  we will alsoinsist on the need to have all the proof of their directinvolvement in this tragic affair being provided to us inthe first place. As soon as a reasonable and acceptableterrain d’entente is reached  the sanctions must be liftedimmediately and unconditionally.The Gambia’s foreign policy is directed by itsnational interest and that of the continent  as well as bythe quest for peace and justice in the world. As membersof the Security Council  we are obliged to ask somepertinent questions when certain actions and initiativeshave a devastating impact on the lives of human beings.One such issue for which we would want straightforwardand clear answers relates to the recent bombing by theGovernment of the United States of a pharmaceuticalcomplex in Khartoum.What my Government seeks to know in this respectis whether  assuming in good faith that the complex wasindeed involved in the production of deadly andprohibited substances  the Government of the UnitedStates fully weighed the consequences of such a terriblestrike on the innocent people of the Sudan beforesanctioning the bombings. In other words  in the view ofthe United States Government  did the satisfaction derivedfrom the destruction of the complex in the Sudanoutweigh the value and premium placed on the lives ofinnocent men  women and children on the scales of theirmoral values? This matter has to be investigated so thatthe international community’s conscience may be atpeace.About the Middle East  we are disappointed that thepeace process  which gave so much hope  has virtuallycollapsed. This undesirable state of affairs does notdiminish our faith in the peace process. We recognize theright of all peoples to self-determination. We thereforerespect the rights of the Palestinian people to emerge fullyas an independent sovereign State. In this context  wewelcome the adoption by the General Assembly ofresolution 52/250 on the participation of Palestine in thework of the United Nations. We look forward to the daywhen Palestine joins the ranks of other States as a fullyfledged Member of the United Nations.It is the wholehearted belief of my delegation thatevery people has a right to self-determination. This beliefinspires the Gambia’s strong support for the aspirations ofthe 21.3 million people of the Republic of China on26Taiwan to exercise their right to share and participate in theactivities of the United Nations. The legitimacy of theiraspirations  both legal and moral  has been reinforced bysimilar actions and measures taken by the United Nationson the issue of parallel representation  which now stands asa useful reminder.We believe  in the same vein  that the people of Cubahave an inalienable right to determine their destiny. Thepractice of unilateral imposition of sanctions by oneMember State against another should end with the demiseof the cold war. As we enter the new millennium  all Statesshould be committed to shaping a better world  a worldwherein all States  big or small  are equal  a world in whichrelations between States are based on mutual respect andstrict observance of international law.The situation between Iraq and Kuwait continues to beone of the most important issues before the United Nations.We would wish to stress the need to have this matterresolved expeditiously. We hope that those who haveinfluence on Iraq will be able to secure its compliance withits international obligations and that it will resumecooperation with the United Nations and its bodies.In this respect  we urge the release of all prisoners ofwar  including missing Kuwaiti nationals and third countrynationals. We encourage sincere cooperation with theInternational Committee of the Red Cross for that purpose.We also call for the return of the properties of theGovernment of Kuwait  including official documentsremoved from their national archives.My delegation is also concerned about thehumanitarian situation in Iraq and the dire plight of theIraqi people. We encourage Iraq to cooperate fully with theUnited Nations  which would end the present logjam andpave the way for a comprehensive review of the sanctions.All of us remain concerned about the ongoing conflictin Afghanistan. We believe that there is no military solutionto the conflict there. We urge all Afghan factions to find apolitical settlement to the conflict  under the auspices of theUnited Nations  which addresses all the interests andconcerns of all the people of Afghanistan.Let me at this juncture reiterate my Government’scondemnation of the killing of Iranian diplomats inAfghanistan. We hope that the perpetrators of this heinouscrime will be pursued and brought to justice.As we approach the new millennium  we areconfronted with long-drawn-out conflicts and new onesthat are emerging. Our world is thus far from being apeaceful and quiet place. At this stage in our history  wemust all strive to enter the twenty-first century as aunited  peaceful family that can proudly bequeath tofuture generations a developed  secure world wheredemocracy  justice and equality are guaranteed toeveryone  irrespective of origin  race  religion or politicalpersuasion. We hope that the Proclamation of the year2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace which was first suggested by the Gambia during the 1997session  will bear fruitful results.Apart from the numerous conflicts  old and new  mydelegation is also concerned about the drug menace which threatens the very fabric of our societies. Thisproblem has now assumed monumental proportions leaving no society safe from its lethal and tenacioustentacles.We believe that all of us have a stake in thisproblem — big and small States alike. We must thereforejoin forces as a common front in our battle against thisevil. The Government of the Gambia is committed tocurbing the problem of drugs in its territory and willcontinue to cooperate with all countries in that regard.The Government of the Gambia welcomed thetwentieth special session of the General Assembly on theworld drug problem held in New York from 8 to 10 June1998. We also fully support the Political Declaration  theDeclaration of the Guiding Principles of Drug DemandReduction and the action plans adopted at the specialsession.We wish to reiterate our concern for the growingand dangerous links between terrorist groups  drugtraffickers and their paramilitary gangs  which haveresorted to all types of violence  thereby undermining thedemocratic institutions of States and violating humanrights.In addition to the drug menace  the internationalcommunity is faced with another challenge: internationalterrorism. The Government of the Gambia condemnsterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. While weagain extend our sympathy to the injured and to thefamilies bereaved as a result of the recent bombings inKenya  Tanzania and South Africa  we call on allcountries to work together to fight against the scourge ofterrorism.27The issue of anti-personnel landmines and its attendantconsequences is of concern. My delegation welcomes thecoming into force of the Ottawa treaty banning antipersonnel landmines.With the end of the cold war  nuclear disarmamentshould be given priority in our efforts to ensure the safetyof humankind. In this context  my delegation is encouragedby what India and Pakistan said about signing theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We join thosewho call for a negotiated and phased programme for thecomplete elimination  by all countries  of nuclear weapons.In order for us all to enter into the new millenniumwith our collective vision for a better world  we willobviously need to reform and revitalize our Organization tomake it more relevant and more responsive to thechallenges of contemporary times. This idea has indeedtaken hold  leading to the consideration of reform measuresproposed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his report“Renewing the United Nations: A programme for reform”.May I take this opportunity to pay tribute to our ableSecretary-General for his unswerving commitment to thereform of our Organization and his cooperation in thisregard. It is our fervent hope that the success of any reformprogramme for the United Nations will be judged by theability of the Organization to make a significant impact onthe lives of all people  in particular those of the developingcountries  as well as by real improvements in itsfunctioning.In this context  we feel very strongly that reformmeasures should focus mainly on strengthening the role ofthe Organization in the promotion of peace anddevelopment. Any such reform programme should addressthe need to enable the Organization to meet the challengesof modern times and preserve the sanctity and centrality ofthe principles of the Charter.The last session witnessed a lot of debate on thisissue. It is sad to note  however  that no substantial progresshas been made. As we pursue this important task  we hopethat the Assembly will defeat the hostile offensive whichseeks to portray it as a “house of words”. Any concrete andworkable decisions that may evolve out of our deliberationson this issue will serve as the litmus test of the politicalwill of the membership to forge ahead with genuinerenewal and revitalization of the Organization.No reform of the United Nations would be completewithout the reform of the Security Council — the mainorgan responsible for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. While some consensus has emergedon a number of issues on the question of equitablerepresentation and increase in the membership of theSecurity Council  important differences still exist on manyother issues. We urge Member States to continue tonegotiate constructively on the outstanding issues with aview to arriving at a compromise that is agreeable  if notsatisfactory  to all.Finally  as we continue to grapple with the reform ofthe United Nations and its organs after 50 years ofoperation  so must we also continue to address theweaknesses  inequalities and inadequacies that plague theinternational economic and social system  global trade finance  investment  international development  and so on.We must continue to do this so as to achieve moremeaningful cooperation and partnership geared towardsthe promotion of socio-economic development and thepreservation of human rights and fundamental freedomsfor all.It therefore bears recalling that the important issuesof women in development and the rights of the childshould continue to be at the top of the internationalagenda. In this endeavour  development must be given thepriority it deserves. Africa  Asia and Latin America mustbe given the opportunity to emerge from their devastatingpast into a future which guarantees for them all thebenefits of democracy and peace  respect for humanrights  development and the restoration of the dignity ofall their peoples.This objective is realizable if we all work together drawing inspiration from the Charter of the UnitedNations. North and South  rich and poor  together we cando it — if we believe in it.The United Nations provides the forum and thenecessary framework to achieve the objectives that we setfor ourselves on this small planet that we share. Beforethe United Nations was founded  the world experiencedbitterly two devastating wars. When the United Nationswas founded half a century ago  it helped to avoid anotherglobal war despite the cold war that ensued. Today  inthis post-cold-war era in which we are confronted withlocalized ethnic and internal political strife  we need theUnited Nations more than ever before.This world body has withstood the test of time andhistory. There is no alternative to the United Nations;countries big and small  rich or poor  all have a vital28stake in strengthening the United Nations rather thanweakening it. The United Nations is more relevant todaythan it has ever been  and we all should strive for itsvitality and the respect of its decisions. We can do this onlywhen it is clear in the minds of all that it is the commonhouse of all the States of the world and that it should beperceived as being just and fair to all  in particular in theresolutions adopted by its Security Council. Theseresolutions should always be in the spirit of fraternalcooperation and understanding that prevail here in thisGeneral Assembly Hall.We in the Gambia remain very optimistic  and weknow we share this optimism because the GeneralAssembly is the asylum of humanity at large against thecruelty and pain of the outer world."
"66",2736,"GNB",53,1998,"On behalf of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau I am pleased to extend our congratulations to you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of the General Assemblyat its fifty-third session. I am particularly pleased becauseit is unanimously agreed that you have exceptionalintellectual  political and diplomatic qualities which willensure the success of our deliberations. It also gives mepleasure to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  and to thank him for his dynamism andinitiative and for the integrity which he displayedthroughout his mandate.I wish to reiterate to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  our appreciation for the tangible results we haveseen in the Organization since his election  and toencourage him to persevere with the same determinationin implementing his reform programme  which wewholeheartedly support.As we prepare to enter the new millennium  it isimportant to be aware of the increasing interdependenceof nations  large and small  and of the consequences ofglobalization  so that through fruitful dialogue at theglobal level  we may together find appropriate responsesto the numerous challenges facing us  particularly thefight against international terrorism. Poverty underdevelopment and the major pandemics must notremain the sole responsibility of the countries affected bythese scourges  because for tomorrow’s world to be stableit must be united founded on the principles of socialjustice and the equality of peoples and nations. Hence  theprimacy of law must continue to guide us in seekinglasting solutions to the numerous regrettable conflictsthroughout the world. We are pleased to note that all thepeoples of the world share a determination to live in peace within their national borders  with their neighbours and therest of the international community.My country welcomes the positive developments in theLockerbie affair  which has been a matter of concern to usfor many years. It has been the subject of decisions byregional organizations  such as the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) and the League of Arab States  as well as theNon-Aligned Movement. We hope that the parties involvedwill spare no effort to ensure that justice is done inconditions of fairness and impartiality  with all thenecessary guarantees  taking into account the recognizedrights of each party. We feel that the clarifications calledfor by the Libyan authorities are legitimate  because theyare based on the objective criteria of neutrality and fair playwhich govern any judicial procedure worthy of the name.The Republic of Guinea-Bissau was admitted as afully fledged member of the United Nations in September1974  following a lengthy and difficult struggle for nationalliberation. For almost a quarter of a century we have beencommitted to respecting and defending the principlesenshrined in the United Nations Charter  because they areessential guidelines for active participation in internationallife and for the building of our young nation.Early on we understood that in order to give shape toour political independence we needed to establish theconditions for harmonious economic development fromwhich all sections of our population could benefit. With theassistance of the international community  therefore  ouryoung State focused on ways and means to build a land offreedom and peace.It goes without saying that 11 years of struggle fornational liberation scarred our people and left an indeliblemark on their minds and bodies. Since Guinea-Bissau is apoor country with very limited resources  everything neededto be built  despite the fact that we did not have thefinancial means or the necessary skills. Therefore  inspiredby the courage that enabled us to galvanize ourselves tofree our country  we set to the task determined to create theright conditions for the full development of our citizens andthe improvement of their living standards.Over the past four years we have succeeded in layingthe foundations of a democratic State based on the rule oflaw and respect for human rights. As members of theAssembly know  building a nation is a long-term taskrequiring both determination and perseverance. Guinea-Bissau  which is among the poorest countries of theworld  is no exception to that rule. Over the past twodecades we have focused on consolidating our nationalunity by strengthening the ties of solidarity that unite ourcitizens  whose maturity had enabled them to wage  andsucceed in  one of the most exemplary national liberationstruggles in Africa. It is precisely this awareness ofbelonging to the same people that has enabled all sectorsof our population to unite and work hand in hand for thedevelopment of the country and the well-being of all.Therefore  since its independence in 1973  despite theeconomic difficulties all States face  Guinea-Bissau haslived in peace and has known a period of great politicalstability.However  since 7 June our country has experiencedtragedy  previously unimaginable  just when it wasbeginning to make notable progress with regard todemocracy and respect for human rights and in theeconomy.An unprecedented crisis for which we were not evenminimally prepared has deeply shaken and paralysed ourcountry for some four months now  endangering thefoundations of the state of law and the existence ofdemocratic institutions in the Republic. The act ofaggression by a party of our country’s national army is aserious violation of the constitutional provisions in forcein Guinea-Bissau. The international community  inparticular the Organization of African Unity (OAU) andthe United Nations  have unreservedly condemned this actof aggression.From this podium  we wish to thank the UnitedNations family for the solidarity and support it hasprovided to the President of the Republic  Mr. JoãoBernardo Vieira; the legal Government of the Republic ofGuinea-Bissau; its leaders; and especially  the innocent victimized population. I should like in particular toconvey our gratitude to the neighbouring countries ofGuinea-Bissau for their active solidarity with our people.On behalf of my Government  I specifically thank theauthorities of Senegal  Guinea  Cape Verde  the Gambiaand Portugal for having rapidly created an appropriaterapid-response team to evacuate citizens and foreignnationals who wished to leave  especially our owndesperate compatriots  a great number of whom havesought refuge and safe haven in neighbouring countries.Each of these brother countries has distinguished itselfadmirably in an exemplary display of compassion and2humanity. I wish to thank them most sincerely on behalf ofour Government and all of my compatriots.I also wish to pay tribute to the courage of my ownfellow citizens and to reiterate  on behalf of ourGovernment  our keen awareness of the difficulties theyface and of the need to ease their suffering by finding aspeedy solution to the current crisis  so that peace andstability may be restored to our homeland  and byestablishing conditions to allow our people to return to theircountry.It is its desire to find a peaceful and negotiatedsolution to this crisis that has inspired the Government ofthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau in its contacts with themembers of the self-proclaimed military junta. Indeed through the joint mediation of members of the Communityof Portuguese-Speaking Countries and the EconomicCommunity of West African States  we have signed aceasefire and begun a constructive dialogue  which we willpursue on the basis of recognition and respect for theconstitutional legality of our country and the need to worktogether to restore peace and stability.We are grateful to all people of goodwill who havecome forward  both in Africa and overseas  to assist us inovercoming all of these difficulties and in finding a finalsolution to the conflict in Guinea-Bissau.The people of Guinea-Bissau are peaceful. They haveage-old relations of friendship and brotherhood with theirneighbours in the Republics of Guinea  Senegal and theGambia. These relations are based on the common destinywhich history and geography have bequeathed us. It is aprecious legacy that present and future generations mustpreserve and defend in the conviction that their identity andtheir social and cultural values will endure. It is this samecommitted and unfailing solidarity which enabled us to freeourselves from the yoke of colonialism  as did our brothersin Guinea and Senegal.As we have already had the opportunity to point out the presence of Guinean and Senegalese troops in Guinea-Bissau is based on the implementation of bilateralagreements duly signed and ratified. In addition to theexistence of an unquestionably legal framework  however it is important to know and recall that  through theirintervention  the Guinean and Senegalese troops bravelyassisted their comrades in arms in Guinea to overcome anattempted coup that has been condemned by the OAU  theUnited Nations and the entire international community.They have made a courageous contribution to themaintenance of constitutional legality and democracy inGuinea-Bissau. Allow me here to pay tribute to them fortheir decisive action and to offer them our full gratitude.For some four months  Guinea-Bissau has beenexperiencing a major tragedy that has brought great lossof human life  serious material damage and muchsuffering to our people  who have been internallydisplaced and made refugees in neighbouring countries Cape Verde and Portugal.Once again  I wish to thank the Assembly for itssolidarity with our country and people. Its assistance isvalued and will be valuable in healing the wounds andassisting all the citizens of our country to understand eachother better and work together for the common future oftheir homeland. I can assure members that we will spareno effort to ensure that  through dialogue and jointendeavours  peace will return to a Guinea-Bissau unitedand reconciled in solidarity.More than ever  we recognize the need to establisha pluralistic democracy in a state of law and anegalitarian society that will guarantee full respect for civil political and human rights. Today more than ever  we areaware of the importance of peace in our country and inother conflicted regions of the world where peoples of thesame country have been torn apart. I am thinking inparticular of the fratricidal wars which for some yearsnow have ravaged other African countries  Angola and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo in particular.At a time when we are preparing to commemoratethe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights  it is appropriate to proclaim our completecommitment to the fundamental principles of democracy good governance and respect for human rights  whichunderpin our search for harmonious development and abetter standard of living. The international community  theUnited Nations in particular  has always heeded theaspirations of the people of Guinea-Bissau. With itssolidarity  it has made our struggle for national liberationits own battle for the emancipation of peoples throughoutthe world. Today  as in the past  we need its support torebuild our country and restore confidence and hope toour compatriots  who impatiently await the moment whenthey can return to their country  their homes  theirfamilies  their friends and their workplaces — to peaceand stability."
"67",2775,"GNQ",53,1998,"First of all  I would like toexpress to Mr. Didier Opertti the sincere congratulations ofthe delegation of Equatorial Guinea on his unanimouselection to the presidency of the General Assembly at thissession of the General Assembly.I also wish to congratulate Ambassador HennadiyUdovenko of Ukraine and to express my appreciation forthe enormous amount of work he accomplished as Presidentat the last session.May I also reiterate to the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  our brother Kofi Annan  my country’ssupport for the efforts he is making to find viable solutionsto conflicts in various parts of the world  and particularlyin Africa. I would like to encourage him to continue withthe reforms he has undertaken to adapt and restructure theUnited Nations.Once again  we are gathered here to consider andreflect on the great challenges humanity is confronting andwill have to continue to confront at the threshold of thenew millennium. Every year in this same forum we see thatthe same causes produce the same effects  but solutionsare slow to arrive. The fact is that we are all victims ofour own contradictions.From this rostrum  we have been repeating for thepast 50 years that humankind wants no more wars  that itwants a lasting peace. Nevertheless  the large industrialcomplexes continue to produce more weapons that areincreasingly sophisticated and deadly.We are assured that the priority at the end of thecentury is the fight against poverty and theunderdevelopment of nations in the framework of theglobalization of our economies. Yet the problems ofhunger  malnutrition  disease and unemployment areassuming alarming proportions  and in many cases thegrowth of these problems is even more apparent than inthe past. In the meantime  the peoples of the worldcontinue to wait  and their future is filled withuncertainty.Let us be honest: disarmament is possible only if thelarge weapons-producing complexes are dismantled. Toclaim the contrary is pure contradiction. Disarmamentrequires the same approach as the fight against drugs —in other words  the destruction of the centres ofproduction  distribution and sale. There is no need for meto elaborate on this issue  since the solution is in thehands of those who benefit from this illicit trade.However  I do wish to refer to two questions that arethe subject of debate at this session of the GeneralAssembly: the phenomenon of globalization and the fightagainst terrorism.In connection with the former  we have seriousdoubts and questions regarding the sincerity of thisdialogue among nations. On the one hand  we have thosewho offer many pretexts for continuing to obstruct freetrade  the free circulation of goods and persons and thetransfer of technology  and who erect other barriers thatprevent the developing countries from achievingsustainable economic growth.As for the African continent  we all know that theUruguay Round is an instrument for marginalizing thedeveloping countries  nor are we unaware that thepayment of foreign debt remains a means of exportingcapital precisely to those who do not need it. Under thesecircumstances  how can we devise an agenda for theglobalization of economic relations between the developed17North and the developing South  in a framework offairness?Globalization must begin with fair prices for our rawmaterials. The immense opportunities and advantagesoffered to the world markets by the developing countries ofAfrica must be put to use in the context of a sincerepartnership between North and South. No one has chosenmarginalization. The question is  should it be forced on us?Some detractors of the African continent applysimplistic reasoning when they categorically state that theprinciple causes of poverty and marginalization in Africaare political in nature: poor governance  corruption andarmed conflict.Without trying to discard these arguments  we believethat they do not justify the unfair treatment of our rawmaterials in the most profitable markets of the North. Nordo we believe that the marginalization now suffered by theAfrican continent is an inevitable phenomenon. A great dealis being done to inscribe our countries in the current agendaof globalization. The ongoing processes of subregional andregional integration are evidence of the political will thattoday infuses African leaders.We wonder about the degree of sincerity andtransparency in the dialogue aimed at facilitating the fullintegration of the African economies into the mechanismsfor globalization of trade and into technological advances.As for globalization  it should mean that everyone sellswhat he has and wherever he wishes  without the customs administrative and tariff barriers that today prevent the freeaccess of the products of the South to the markets of theNorth.Furthermore  the ever present issue of foreign debtremains an obstacle to economic growth in manydeveloping countries.My country  Equatorial Guinea  sincerely believes thatthis situation is not fortuitous  and far less is it due to alack of potential or a lack of opportunity. What we call foris not simply assistance. We want our own efforts to bevalued; we want use to be made of the variousopportunities we can offer to the world of globalization thatlies ahead.Nevertheless  all of this also requires the peace andsocio-political stability of nations. Unfortunately  it wouldseem that everything is being done to create instability inour countries. Today  we are seriously threatened fromoutside and within our borders by terrorism andmercenary actions carried out by individuals or groupsblinded by hunger for power  ethnic hatred  racism andthe desire for hegemony.For the first time in its history  my country hasexperienced  in the course of the past 18 months  two actsof armed destabilization. One was on 17 May 1997  whena ship carrying arms and mercenaries was detained by theAngolan police in its territorial waters. The other was on21 January of this year  when a group of individualsattacked a number of towns in my country and murderedsix persons in cold blood.What justification can there be for terrorist actionssuch as those perpetrated against the United Statesembassies in Kenya and Tanzania? What justification canthere be for a band of terrorists who murder peacefulcitizens in cold blood? What political claims can justifythe murder and mutilation of another human being  asoccurred in my country?On this question  some countries present here areacting with a double standard; depending on their owninterests  terrorist actions are justifiable or not. Whenthese actions take place within a developing country some powerful communications media invoke  amongother such fallacies  the “struggle for the freedom ofpeoples” to do away with regimes that  according to them are dictatorial. But when similar actions of the same typetake place in any country of the North  then the storychanges  and those responsible for such actions are calledterrorists and enemies of society.That double standard was evident when such actionsreceived the support and solidarity of certain Spanishpolitical groups and elements of the Spanishcommunications media. Only the Government of thatcountry condemned those acts. On the other hand  a lobbywas formed from among several political parties — theBasque Nationalist Party  the United Left and the SpanishSocialist Workers’ Party — each of which publishedcommuniqués expressing their solidarity with theperpetrators of those terrorist acts. Since then  those samegroups have been trying to fabricate an ethnic problem inmy country. They have promoted a number of resolutionsagainst my country in various international forums including in recent meetings of the European Parliamentand the Joint Assembly of the European Union and theAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific Group of States  in a clearattempt to justify the terrorist acts in question.18My Government  however  faithful to its commitmentto establish a State based on the rule of law in EquatorialGuinea  held a public trial  with procedural guarantees andinternational observers. Furthermore  the 15 death sentencesimposed on the main perpetrators of those crimes have beencommuted by the President of the Republic of EquatorialGuinea  Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  in an effort topreserve the social unity of the nation. But it seems thatsuch measures still do not satisfy the political circles thatare persisting in their attempts to destabilize the peacefulpeople of Equatorial Guinea.Nevertheless  I would like to assure the Assembly that thanks to the maturity of the people of Equatorial Guineaand because of their peaceful spirit and openness todialogue and democratic debate  we have been free fromthe serious upheavals experienced by some countries andregions of our continent as a result of such actions.The internal realities of Equatorial Guinea thereforebear no relation to the systematic campaign of houndingand harassment that has been waged against it for severalyears. Peace and stability prevail  investments are flowingin and there are real signs of growth. The political reformsare irreversible  our State of law is being strengthened andthe better governance of the country is being promoted. Tothat end  the Government of Equatorial Guinea has relationsof cooperation with several international organizations andfriendly countries for the establishment of technicalassistance programmes in the fields of economics democracy  human rights and governance. We arecontinuing to cooperate with the United NationsCommission on Human Rights  and our cooperation withthe international financial institutions is positive in the areasto which I have referred.We are clearly living during a time of promise andrebirth in our country. We appeal here to the internationalcommunity to show its solidarity by supporting our effortsto consolidate the democratic process and theimplementation of the plan for the socio-economicdevelopment of the country  outlined by the nationaleconomic conference  which took place in Bata from 8 to14 September 1997.With regard to the African continent  we urge theinternational community to find mechanisms geared toachieving a ceasefire and ending the hostilities in the GreatLakes region and to restoring peace and order in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Angola  Guinea-Bissau Sierra Leone  Eritrea and Ethiopia. To that end  we wish toreaffirm here the recommendations contained in the Batadeclaration for the promotion of democracy  peace andsustainable development in Africa  which was adopted bythe subregional conference on democratic institutions andpeace in Central Africa  held from 18 to 21 May 1998under the auspices of the United Nations  at which thePresident of Equatorial Guinea recommended the creationof a subregional parliament to deal with issues so as toguarantee peace and security in the subregion. EquatorialGuinea pledges to make its contribution to the attainmentof that objective.Finally  my country reaffirms its support for thenecessary reform of the Security Council. With regard tothe increase of its membership  we are in favour ofequitable distribution so that our Organization will be ablefaithfully to reflect the geopolitical realities of today’sworld. In this context  Equatorial Guinea associates itselfwith the position  adopted at the twelfth summit of thenon-aligned countries held a month ago in Durban  SouthAfrica  that Africa should have two permanent seats andfive non-permanent seats  in the interests of the credibilityand democratization of the United Nations."
"68",2821,"GRC",53,1998,"I wish first to extend to thePresident my warm congratulations on his assumption ofthe conduct of the current session. Uruguay has indeed amajor role to play in international developments  both atthe regional and the international level.I also wish to congratulate the current President?spredecessor  Mr. Udovenko  for his performance duringthe fifty-second session. My congratulations and supportare also addressed to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  whohas deployed enormous efforts not only to keep UnitedNations services running  but also to further enhance theirefficiency through the ongoing reform process. Hispolitical skills have been demonstrated in settling disputeswhich threaten international peace and security.The Austrian Foreign Minister delivered a statementon behalf of the European Union to which myGovernment fully subscribes. I would like to elaboratefurther on some particular issues.27Greece consistently endeavours for peace andsecurity — security in political and socio-economic terms security through human dignity and through internationallaw and order.In that spirit  Greece welcomes the establishment bythe Rome Conference of an International Criminal Court.We hope that the Preparatory Committee  to convenein the wake of the Conference  will decisively tackle theremaining definition aspects of the crime of aggression.Greece considers disarmament and non-proliferation tobe guarantees of international peace. In the nuclear field we welcome two significant developments: the signing ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and thedecision reached in Geneva to negotiate a treaty banningthe production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons andother explosive nuclear devices.My country shares the general concern about nucleartests. We also concur with the general recommendations onthe issue  namely  adherence to the comprehensive test banand the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons  as well as compliance with the internationalrules. Bacteriological and toxin weapons  known as thenuclear weapons of the poor  remain a threat to humanity.Reinforcement of the relevant Convention remains anurgent priority.The Ottawa Treaty on anti-personnel landmines madehistory by totally banning their use. We urge thosecountries  particularly in the sensitive south-easternEuropean area  that have yet to accede to this Treaty toseriously consider the humanitarian aspect of this exerciseand act accordingly.Peacekeeping plays a major role in staving off crises.Greece has taken an active part in a wide range of UnitedNations operations  such as the United Nations Iraq-KuwaitObservation Mission  and in the Western Sahara  inGeorgia  in Bosnia and Herzegovina  as well as in theUnited Nations humanitarian mission in Iraq and OperationALBA in Albania. Greece also provides annually asignificant financial contribution to the United NationsPeacekeeping Force in Cyprus.The United Nations needs adequate resources andmeans in order to carry out its mandate. Greece hasvoluntarily accepted a higher percentage in the scale ofassessments and pays its contributions to the Organizationin full and on time.Combating drugs is a high political priority for theGreek Government. Greece closely followed theproceedings of the General Assembly?s special session onthe international drug problem. Last June  my country?scommitment in the fight against drugs was reflected in itschairing the regional Dublin Group formation for theBalkans and the near Middle East.From its establishment  the modern Greek State hasproclaimed that no discrimination based on colour  raceor ethnic origin would be tolerated on its territory  whilethe human rights and fundamental freedoms of allindividuals who set foot on it would be fully protected.We have made a tradition of adhering to  implementingand supporting compliance with the human rights normsset by United Nations instruments and major conventions.The restructuring and new membership of theSecurity Council rightly elicit our attention. Theenlargement of the Security Council should be based bothon the criteria of the United Nations Charter and on theongoing realities. We understand that major regionalorganizations  such as the European Union  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Arab League  the Organization ofAmerican States  the Organization of African Unity  theOrganization of the Islamic Conference  the SouthernAfrican Development Community  the South PacificForum and other important forums have a specialresponsibility in identifying those countries which  byevident commitment to principles enshrined in theCharter  may further subscribe and contribute to its goals.On the other hand  53 years after the signing of theUnited Nations Charter in San Francisco  we have toacknowledge the new realities  such as the collapse of thebipolar system and the emergence of new stabilizingfactors all over the world.The future of this body of countries with limitedmembership  regardless of their geographical location orideological orientation  calls for our consideration. Wehope that a renewed effort of the Open-ended WorkingGroup  under your guidance  Sir  will eventually reach acompromise solution.Concerning the world economy  I share the view thatglobalization presents us with an array of opportunitiesand potential benefits. Nevertheless  it also entailsincreased risks. The international community has to makefull use of the international financial institutions andinstruments to weather crises and respond to the28challenges of globalization. No effort should be spared tohelp developing countries  and in particular the leastdeveloped among them  to avoid marginalization throughglobalization.Two very important aspects of the effort to betterintegrate developing countries into the world economy meritour consideration: first  the rapid and determined extensionof debt relief  within the terms of the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Debt Initiative; and secondly  improvedmarket access so that developing countries can effectivelybenefit from the trade opportunities that the Uruguay Roundoffers. In this respect  financing for development assistanceremains an additional element of paramount importance.In the field of environment and sustainabledevelopment  Greece supports the work of the appropriateUnited Nations Commission. The significance of this foruminvites me to recall a grave problem: the threat to theenvironment resulting from the expansion of nuclear-powerproduction plants  particularly when they are located inareas subject to earthquakes  neighbouring sea traffic andinadequate infrastructure. In addition  we are deeplyconcerned by the increasing stockpiling of nuclear wastesand shipments of radioactive materials  threatening the livesand properties of developing countries? populations  inparticular those of the vast South Pacific area.Turning to my country?s presence in regionalorganizations  may I recall the active role played by Greecein the Council of Europe through the Committee ofMinisters  which it currently chairs. Among the issues onits agenda  I note the European Court of Human Rights which will enhance the protection of human rights at theEuropean level.In the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope  Greece is involved in every effort aimed atpromoting the notion of comprehensive security. Withregard to activities in the human dimension  I simplymention my country?s contribution in the field of electionsobservation.Greece was happy to attend  as a guest  the twelfthNon-Aligned Movement summit held recently in Durban South Africa. Its keynote was clearly the shape and scopethat a movement born in a bipolar  confrontational worldcould claim in the coming millennium  ushered in byglobalization. The message of the Durban declarationdeserves our attention and consideration.A year has elapsed since I expressed in this veryforum the hope that Turkey would finally abandon itsintransigent policies on Cyprus. It has proven to be a vainhope. This was a year of stagnation and frustration.Frustrated have been the efforts of Secretary-General KofiAnnan and his Special Adviser  Mr. Cordovez  torelaunch the intercommunal talks. Special envoys fromseveral countries  including members of the SecurityCouncil  hoping to unblock the situation  came backfrustrated from Ankara and the occupied part of Cyprus.Frustrated remain the hopes of the European Union tobring the Turkish Cypriot together with the Greek Cypriotin a prosperous State of Cyprus that is a member of theEuropean family.The reaction from Ankara  obediently echoed by theTurkish Cypriot leadership  has been one of harshrejection  either in terms of a flat negation or by imposingconditions tantamount to cancelling what has been desiredby the international community  prescribed by UnitedNations resolutions and even accepted by the TurkishCypriot leadership itself.Such an attitude of rejection is easily explained bythe notorious designs of the Turkish Government to effectthe partition of Cyprus. Mr. Ecevit  Deputy PrimeMinister of Turkey  has on several occasions said that theCyprus question was resolved once and for all by hiscountry?s armed forces? invasion in 1974. Twenty-fouryears after the invasion  Cyprus remains a divided islandand the Turkish occupation forces increase their presenceand weaponry  even denying their victims the right toeffectively defend themselves. Twenty-four years isenough. It is time for the international community tostrongly support the Secretary-General in fulfilling hismandate of bringing the two communities to thenegotiating table to initiate a dialogue on gradualdisarmament towards the complete demilitarization of theisland.Greece wishes to establish good-neighbourlyrelations with Turkey  based on the principles ofinternational law and respect for international treaties.The International Court of Justice at The Hague whose compulsory jurisdiction has been accepted byGreece  is the appropriate legal forum for the settlementof problems in our relations. A positive response byTurkey to that effect would constitute a step towards thebeginning of a new period of mutual understanding.29Greece pursues a policy promoting stability  good-neighbourly relations  cooperation and economicdevelopment in South-Eastern Europe. We participate ininternational projects or take our own initiatives  in thecontext of bilateral or multilateral schemes. We offer troopsand counselling  funds and food. Greece offers to itsneighbours and the region a much needed feeling of trustand security.My country accords a high priority to our relationswith Albania. We welcome the efforts of the AlbanianGovernment to further pursue the process of normalizationof democratic institutions and its close cooperation with theinternational community. Greece considers it its duty tostand by Albania in its efforts to overcome the seriousdifficulties it faces.In the neighbouring Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and more particularly in the area of Kosovo  the situationhas reached a critical point. The vicious circle of the use offorce must be halted. The refugees and displaced personsmust be allowed to return to their homes safely  withoutdelay. Greece has sent humanitarian assistance to alleviatethe plight of the refugees in northern Albania. We welcomethe setting up of the Albanian negotiating group  andsupport the immediate start of negotiations with a view toarriving  as soon as possible  at a peaceful and negotiatedsolution on the future autonomy status of Kosovo  withinthe internationally recognized borders of the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia. Terrorist acts and indiscriminateand disproportionate repression are unacceptable. Greecehas actively participated  and will actively participate  in allinternational efforts aimed at securing a peaceful solutionin Kosovo.In Bosnia  Greece notes with satisfaction the progressachieved so far in the implementation of the Dayton PeaceAgreement. We maintain close relations with the Bosnianparties and offer substantial contributions to efforts aimedat ensuring the stability and development of this country.Greek soldiers participate in the Stabilization Force (SFOR)as well as in international observer missions. Importantprogrammes undertaken by the Greek Government in theframework of the donors conference  held in 1997  areabout to be completed.In our relations with Bulgaria  the former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia and Romania  the promotion ofmutually beneficial cooperation in all fields is of paramountimportance.In the multilateral field  Greece is committed to  andactively involved in  such regional schemes as the South-Eastern Europe cooperation process  the RoyaumontInitiative  the South-East Europe Cooperative Initiativeand the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. We note withsatisfaction that South-Eastern Europe leaders will meetagain this year in Antalya  Turkey  thus consolidating theprocess we initiated last year in Crete.In the Middle East  the present stagnation underlinesthe urgent need to reactivate the peace process. Its revivalwill bring hope for peace and prosperity. Once more  westress the need for full implementation of the relevantUnited Nations resolutions and agreements  and we urgethe parties to make every effort to achieve real peace which should be a just  lasting and global peace. Greecewelcomes any endeavour likely to produce positiveresults  while supporting the initiatives undertaken by theEuropean Union?s special envoy in the Middle East.Successful meetings organized by the special envoy andthe Greek Government bring together prominent Israelisand Palestinians in a conciliatory spirit. These meetingswill  hopefully  be institutionalized as the “AthensDialogue for Peace and Cooperation in the Middle East”.The Mediterranean remains our life companion. Wehave been the pioneers for the adoption of a EuropeanUnion Mediterranean policy  accompanied by the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (MEDA) regulation  throughwhich financial aid to the countries concerned isconsiderably increased.The African continent is an emerging reality thatwill affect the future of humanity. However  progress inthe fields of political pluralism and economic stabilizationhas been coupled  over the course of the last year  withregression in the form of ruinous civil wars or borderconflicts in a number of African countries. Theinternational community should stand by the Africannations and their organizations on the eve of the twenty-first century  advocating the need for good-neighbourlyrelations and  within the countries themselves  democraticrule  respect for human rights and an open marketeconomy.Greece shares the general concern about thedevelopments in Asia. The financial turmoil is by nomeans settled. Indeed  it is still sending disturbingvibrations through the European and world economies.Asia can  however  overcome the crisis. Allowing externalor internal tensions to drag on  with the prospect ofescalation  obviously spells future disaster  in terms of30chasing or scaring foreign investment out of the area and offunnelling precious funds to such dangerous and vainprojects as the production of weapons of mass destruction.Greece follows closely and contributes actively to thehistorical process of eastern European countries?reintegration into the European system. Our political credoand vision is that of a Europe without dividing lines andscars from the past. In this context  Greece supports theenlargement of the European Union with the 10 candidatecountries of Central and Eastern Europe  together withCyprus  advocating the simultaneous launching of a globaland inclusive accession process with all candidate countries.Greece also extends its institutional links and promotesits historical  economic and cultural ties with the RussianFederation and the Ukraine and the other newlyindependent States in the Caucasus  Black Sea and CentralAsia.Our excellent relations with the United States andCanada are further enhanced through political and militarycooperation in peacemaking initiatives and peacekeepingactivities in South-Eastern Europe  as well as cooperationin preventing and eliminating terrorism. Furthermore Greece  as a member of the European Union  stands for abroad transatlantic dialogue and the advancement of theNew Trans-Atlantic Agenda.Greece has traditional ties of friendship with thecountries of Latin America  and  both bilaterally and as amember of the European Union  systematically supportsongoing  comprehensive dialogue and cooperation withthem.Until very recently Greece had been a recipient ofdevelopment assistance  but for three years now we havebeen an important contributor  equal to the standards of theDevelopment Assistance Committee of the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We maynot be such a wealthy country  but we are trying to granteffective and qualitative assistance to those interested in itand in need of it  using our experience to make this asbeneficial as possible  supporting the struggle againstpoverty and famine and for economic and socialdevelopment  and also trying to help promote human rights democracy and institutions of civil society.I would like also to refer briefly to an issue which isof particular concern to my country  the Olympic Games.Inspired by the Olympic Ideal  Greece presented on 4February 1998 to the International Olympic Committee inNagano  Japan  a comprehensive proposal outlining a setof organizational structures and a broad range of activitiesaimed at the practical realization of an Olympic Truce atthe Athens Games of 2004 and at the strengthening of therole of the Olympic Movement. In order to support theseimportant activities  Greece proposed the establishment ofan international centre for the Olympic Truce  at the verysite of ancient Olympia.Further  Greece took the initiative and proposed thecreation of a cultural Olympics for the first time incontemporary world. This would strengthen dialogueamong different cultures the world over. This proposalwas welcomed by the International Olympic Committee and preparatory work has already started between theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO)  the International OlympicCommittee and the Greek Government.I would like to spare the delegates another pre-electoral speech. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs ofthe Netherlands preceded me  I had to scale down myspeech and become very modest  but I cannot avoidreferring to the candidacy of Greece for the 1999-2000term for one of the two non-permanent seats allocated tothe Group of Western European and Other States on theSecurity Council.My Government has legitimate and justifiedambitions for requesting the support of United Nationsmember countries to such a distinction. Our long-standingforeign policy is dedicated to world peace and security  tothe trend of decolonization and self-determination  toassisting developing and less developed countries and torespect for international law and human rights.We condemn terrorism in all its forms.We are in favour of the independence  sovereigntyand territorial integrity of all United Nations MemberStates and of the implementation of the provisions of theUnited Nations Charter  including the democratic principleof fair and balanced representation of all Member Statesin the various organs and agencies of the United Nations.I would like to draw the honourable delegates?attention to this last principle. In the Western EuropeanGroup  a situation is occurring in which very fewmembers — five of them — have by now served during44 of the 52 years of this Organization?s existence. Smalland average-sized countries should also have a chance tobe present on the Security Council  and I am proud to31represent one of those average-sized countries  as I proposemy country?s candidacy for a non-permanent seat on theSecurity Council."
"69",2862,"GRD",53,1998,"My delegation congratulatesthe Secretary-General and his staff on their efforts to makethe United Nations more responsive to the needs ofMember States and of the international community especially the developing nations.My delegation also wishes to congratulate Mr. DidierOpertti on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session. We also wish to thankMr. Hennadiy Udovenko  the former Foreign Minister ofUkraine  for his exceptional performance in the conduct ofthe proceedings of the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly.The philosopher Thomas Aquinas admonished us thus:“It is better to light up than merely to shine; to deliverunto others contemplated truths  than simply tocontemplate.”In the context of the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  in obedience tothat admonition by Aquinas  the Grenada delegation humblyoffers to this noble Assembly  for its reflection  a fewcontemplated truths in relation to human interaction withinindividual societies  as well as among nations.In his Lines Written in Early Spring  the poet WilliamWordsworth wrote:“I heard a thousand blended notes While in a grove I sat reclined In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughtsBring sad thoughts to the mind.“To her fair works did nature linkThe human soul that through me ran;And much it grieved my heart to thinkWhat man has made of man.”In book I of The Republic  Plato made theobservation that“Mankind censure injustice fearing that they may bethe victims of it  and not because they shrink fromcommitting it.”And Michael de Jouvenal  in his foreword to atwentieth century work on the history of the disintegrationof ancient Greece  urges that“we study history to learn from history  to acquirepolitical prudence”.The ideal of peace among the nations of our worldhas twice during the course of this century inspired theinstitution of a body to moderate  if not regulate international interaction. Regrettably  with respect to bothof those initiatives  the focus was on the avoidance of warand not on the concept of peace  so insightfullyadumbrated by Aquinas as the tranquillity of order.The League of Nations collapsed ignominiously. Itperished for lack of honour. It was unfaithful to even therather limited principles upon which it had been founded.The weak were sacrificed on the altar of expediency  inveneration of military might. So ended the first attempt atseeking to realize international peace through the pursuitof avoiding war. Continued appeasement and non-involvement then spawned the Second World War.Yet  following the horrors of the Second World War which prompted the setting up of the United Nations  thelate Winston Churchill  in persuading the British peopleand  indeed  the rest of the world  to join in the secondattempt to pursue peace among nations  advised that“To jaw-jaw is better than to war-war”.History records that we have not succeeded inavoiding war.18As we in the Assembly engage in the observation ofevents among nations  as well as within them  the Grenadadelegation sincerely and humbly suggests that we shouldreflect on the question of why we have not examinedrelevant history to acquire the relevant political prudence?Can it be that there still exists among us apredominating subscription to the notion that might is right?Or is it that there remains an overriding precept whichdetermines the operations of the United Nations and itssubsidiary bodies: that wealth necessarily merits theenjoyment of special privileges — albeit to the significantdisadvantage of the less wealthy  and especially the poor?Can it be that such a precept continues to informperceptions as to what is truly acceptable in relation to thecomposition of the Security Council and the veto?History attests to the human experience across theentire spectrum  in the context of the Pax Romana as wellas the rule of recent empires.When will we acquire the political prudence to orderhuman interaction  within and among nations  so that theresulting tranquillity will ensure that peace will prevail inour world?It is with deep humility that Grenada suggests thatpeace among men and among nations will be realized onlywhen human rights are truly respected and honoureduniversally. Indeed  Grenada submits that the several humanrights which have been individually identified may all beencapsulated within a single enunciation: the right to therealization of the fullness of human dignity on the part ofevery person.In this regard  Grenada expresses concern about thefate of the Kuwaiti prisoners whose human rights are beingviolated as we speak.Prominent among the causes of erosion of humandignity are poverty and deprivation in relation to theprerequisites for the sustaining of life. In this regard physical disablement warrants particular inclusion as asignificant cause of erosion of human dignity.Accordingly  Grenada supports unequivocally the callfor the eradication of poverty from our world and urges thatthis objective be pursued as a matter of urgency. Grenadaexpresses deep concern over the sanctioning by the UnitedNations of trade embargoes which include food andmedicines. Grenada humbly urges that this kind of mandatebe speedily revisited. As to maiming injury  Grenadaurges that all anti-personnel landmines now in existencebe destroyed  and further production banned forthwith.Moreover  Grenada now repeats another of its earlierexhortations: that the battlefields of war  past and present should  as a United Nations sponsored project  be clearedof all weapons of war which still possess the potential forcausing injury and even death  to dumb animals or toman.In narcotics there resides an extremely powerfulpotential for the erosion of human dignity. The voluntaryuse of illicit drugs by individuals does not negate thisdestructive potential. Indeed  such voluntary indulgencemerely hastens the transformation of latent potential intovirulent activity.Accordingly  Grenada urges the United Nations to beincreasingly unrelenting in its campaign against narco-trafficking. Indeed  we suggest that the United Nations —with support as is appropriate in each case — sponsornational programmes whose purpose is to eradicate theuse of illicit drugs by the pupils and students in ourschools  and by all youths throughout our world.In this regard  we applaud the drug abuse reductioneducation (DARE) project and commend it for usethroughout the world  modified as may be mostappropriate to particular circumstances.Disasters occur in many forms. Yet whether naturalin origin or the product of human device  physicaldisasters constitute a most significant threat to humandignity  as they do to human life.As to natural disasters  humankind is aware of thatthreat. Hence the awe experienced when we areconfronted by such disasters. That very feeling of awe though  may well  in its embrace  extend to an acceptanceof the consequences as being inevitable — and less onlyin degree than the inevitability of the disaster itself. Thismay well explain the inadequacies of actions for disasterpreparedness which are so regularly observable. We mustconfront this form of resignation.We must also confront the deliberate and wilfulhuman imposition of physical disaster.Human dignity is assaulted also by economicdisaster. Recent experiences in the Far East  and thecurrent ones in other parts of our world  bear tellingtestimony to this.19Grenada contends that the United Nations and itsrelevant subsidiary bodies  as well as its appropriateagencies and agents  must  as a matter of conscience  revisitthe concept of globalization which has informed variousregimes  especially in relation to trade of all kinds  whichhave caused such degradation of human dignity and suchpain among the peoples of the world.Trade that is not informed by concern for humannessdoes not promote human well-being. Indeed  it cannot. Forthe very ignoring of such concern is one of the hallmarksof a diabolical origin.Our world needs to be humanity-centred andhumanity-friendly. Grenada urges that we regulate the manysystems which together compose our global interactions.Grenada humbly invites attention to  and considerationof  the observations of an international non-governmentalorganization committee on human rights in trade andinvestment. By a letter dated 20 July 1998  the committeeinvited our Prime Minister and our Foreign Minister toreflect on some potential threats to our people’s enjoymentof their human rights. The potential for these threats residesin one or another of the multilateral investment agreementsand the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements.Five such threats were identified  and we accept thevalidity of the arguments adduced in each case.Nonetheless  only three are presented here so as tostimulate curiosity  and thus further contemplation.First  the human right to self-determination embracesthe right of all peoples to determine their economic future.This subsidiary right may well be frustrated  if not denied where freedom is given to foreign investors to operatewithout a requirement of social responsibility to the overallcommunity in which they do business.Secondly  pursuance of the concept of non-discrimination in trade and investment may well militateagainst the pursuit of governmental policy to eliminateunjust discrimination  on the one hand  and  on the other  topromote the relaxation of equality on the part of vulnerablegroups.Thirdly  stipulated conditions in favour of foreigninvestors may very well be inimical to the right to realizethe fullness of one’s human dignity.Earth  with its physical environment  is a divine gift toall the people of the world  and there devolves upon all ofus a collective responsibility to protect both our planet-home and its environment. Further  we have been givenauthority over the locality in which we choose to live —such authority  however  not extending to destructivelyimpinging on any other similar locality  irrespective of itssize or population. Thus  every nation has the right todevelop the resources of its territory  but not to thedetriment of the people of any other nation.Accordingly  to engage in the transportation ofnuclear waste through the terrestrial or marineenvironments of other countries is to engage in violatingthe human rights of the people of those countries. Thesame is true of dumping toxic waste  or food consideredin the country of origin or of processing to be hazardousto health  on the markets of the less developed countriesof our world.Attention has already been invited in thispresentation to the ignominious collapse of the League ofNations  as well as to the cause of that calamity. Sufficeit  therefore  simply to refer now to instances ofmembership in the Untied Nations of both components ofwhat hitherto were single sovereign States.The people of the Republic of China on Taiwan —and they number more than 22 million — have exercisedthe right to participate in international organizations including the United Nations. And in the further exerciseof that right  they have chosen to contributeinternationally towards the realization by the peoples ofthe less developed countries of the fullness of their humandignity. And the Republic of China on Taiwan has chosento do so within the compass of certain regional andinternational organizations which are associated in oneway or another with the United Nations system. To denythose 22 million people the right to exercise that choiceis to violate their human right to choose. Further  toengage in such denial is also to enforce a restriction onthe enjoyment of enhanced benefit by the peoples ofStates which are members of those organizations.Grenada therefore calls for the granting to theRepublic of China on Taiwan of an appropriate form ofmembership that would allow for participation by theRepublic of China on Taiwan in the World HealthOrganization  the World Trade Organization and theCaribbean Development Bank.Grenada does not condone terrorism. Indeed  wecondemn it  whosoever the perpetrators may be. In socondemning terrorism  we are especially mindful of the20vicious action-reaction spiral relating to engagement interrorist activity  whose viciousness increases with eachcycle. And in this latter regard we perceive as engaging interrorism any action that is calculated to strike terror intothe minds and hearts of people anywhere.Quite early in this presentation  reference was made toAquinas’s concept of peace. But no attention has yet beengiven here to the achievement of the tranquillity of order which Aquinas defines as peace. Comment has  however been made on aggression and violations of one kind oranother. Accordingly  it is fitting that this presentationshould end with a succinct elaboration of Aquinas’s conceptof peace  which it must be stated  is not taken from any ofthe works of Aquinas. Rather  it is taken from a littlebooklet entitled Golden Moments  and this particular piecebears the caption “If there is”:“If there is righteousness in the heart  there willbe beauty in the character. If there is beauty in thecharacter  there will be harmony in the home. If thereis harmony in the home  there will be order in thenation. When there is order in the nation  there will bepeace in the world”.May God bless everyone who participates in thedeliberations of this Assembly  whatever the business oroccasion  so that this Assembly may truly be a blessing onour world."
"70",2909,"GTM",53,1998,"Omar Aguirre  of Bolivia; Lisa Malone  ofAustralia; Pablo Gorga  of Uruguay; Luis Escoto  of Spain;Pedro Ruz  of Chile; together with Guatemalans RolandoPalacios and Celso Mart'nez  all of them United Nationspersonnel stationed in Guatemala to collaborate in theverification of the peace agreements  gave their lives incarrying out their mission  when they died in a tragic airaccident  on 17 March 1998  as they were travelling to aremote area to perform their duties. With the Assembly’spermission  I would like to pay a sincere tribute to thosewho  at a time of peace  generously gave their lives forpeace in Guatemala.Equally moved by the destruction left by hurricaneGeorges in its passage through the Dominican Republic Haiti  Cuba  Puerto Rico  Antigua and Barbuda  Dominica Saint Kitts and Nevis  and other Caribbean territories andthe southern United States  I wish to express the solidarityof the people and the Government of Guatemala with thosewho suffered economic losses and the inconsolable painof the loss of human lives.Guatemala feels honoured to welcome Mr. Opertti tothe roster of eminent persons who have had the privilegedresponsibility of conducting the debates of this forumthroughout its existence. His election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-third session  whileshowing recognition of his great diplomatic talent  is thenatural result of the efforts that he and his country havemade in promoting understanding among the peoples andthe nations of the world.We are fully convinced that our Organization willbenefit from his ample experience as one of thesupporters of the principles of the inter-American system.This guarantees that the excellent work of hispredecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  will be continued and we wish to express our appreciation for the excellentmanner in which he conducted the work of the GeneralAssembly during the year of his mandate.This is the second time that Guatemala hasaddressed the General Assembly since the signature of thepeace agreements that put an end to the fratricidalstruggle that senselessly tore our nation apart for almostfour decades. I must again acknowledge the solidarity theinternational community showed throughout the process especially during the difficult and protracted task ofimplementing the accords  which will lead us to thereconstruction of our society and the fulfilment of ourhighest aspirations for economic development  equity andjustice.The United Nations and the Government and thepeople of Guatemala have worked together in theimplementation of the peace agreements. Under theUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala(MINUGUA) we have gone forward with firm and suresteps in complying with the accords  and it is with greatsatisfaction that I can report to the Assembly that thetimetable of the accords is being met with sure progress.That is why we welcome the recent report of theSecretary-General on the status of verification of thepeace agreements in Guatemala (A/53/288)  and westrongly support his recommendation that the GeneralAssembly authorize the renewal of MINUGUA’s mandateuntil 31 December 1999.As a Member of an Organization whose mainobjective is to preserve peace among nations  our own15experience of living in peace leads us to reaffirm our beliefin multilateralism as a genuine form of pooling efforts forcoexistence among the peoples of the world. To theordinary citizen of Guatemala  regional organizations  sisternations and international commitments are no longerregarded as abstractions  instead becoming elements of ourreality which  added to our political and cultural experience is producing a new synthesis of the local with the global.That new synthesis in Guatemala means peace  which isrooted in the happy conjunction of the ancestral pacifism ofour own ancient cultures with the universally acceptedethical values promoted in the various centres ofmultilateral convergence  both regionally and globally.These positive results have also been factors inaccelerating our involvement in regional cooperationinitiatives  especially in the process of Central Americanintegration  in which Guatemala  determined to achieve it has made significant efforts  motivated by the view sharedby the other actors in the process that a united CentralAmerica will be much more capable of facing thechallenges of globalization for the benefit of our peoples.Believing also that the centres of multilateraladministration are fundamental to promoting peace anddevelopment  we have been motivated to participateactively in the tasks of consolidating the work of theAssociation of Caribbean States  an organization of 25member States sharing the Caribbean Sea as their commonheritage and having the most varied cultural and linguistictraditions. This Association has decided to unite in order toexplore the regional potential for promoting conditions thatwill improve the living standards of their citizens.We do not have time to continue listing the variousregional integration initiatives. However  they exemplify theimportance that Guatemala attaches to multilateral bodies inefforts to coexist under conditions of justice and equalityand in an environment which is increasingly interactive andinterdependent. The global condition of the contemporaryworld is no longer expressed recurrently through periodicevents  but is rather a daily constant that  every minute concerns all individuals on the planet. It poses challengesthat may be regarded as either opportunities or threats andthat elicit a full spectrum of responses  from naiveenthusiasm to irrational fundamentalist resistance.That is why multilateral administration requiresrenewed  flexible and participatory institutions that respondto the dynamic conditions derived from the development ofinternational relations in the post-cold-war era. Thus Guatemala has followed with interest modernization effortswithin this Organization. We have enthusiasticallyassumed the responsibility of contributing to theimplementation of administrative reforms through a pilotproject.We are pleased at the progress that has been madein this area  and we would like to express once again ourappreciation for the support we have received from theagencies of the United Nations system  which  under thecoordination of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP)  are helping us with the process ofpeace and development and making system-wide reforma reality in our country.The work undertaken by Secretary-General KofiAnnan in response to the concerns of Member Statesregarding the modernization of our Organization deservesour very special recognition. Last July  the Secretary-General honoured us with a visit to Guatemala  and wesaw for ourselves the determination and commitment hedemands of himself in order to strengthen ourOrganization and the clear vision of the future that guideshis efforts towards the new millennium.Guatemala agrees with other Members on the needto continue the deliberations on the reform of the SecurityCouncil. We have studied with interest the variousproposals that have been presented  and we hope thatdespite the differences in their current positions  MemberStates will be able to reach the necessary level ofagreement and understanding in order to bring about areform that is equitable for all regions and thatdemonstrates the democratic will that should prevail inthe Organization.I must emphasize the important role that the UnitedNations must play in the creation  codification andapplication of the norms of international law. A greaterinvolvement by the Organization in this matter wouldpromote greater creativity on the part of Member Statesin confronting shared problems and would eliminate legalambiguities that could enable national legislatures todictate international laws which would then be imposedon less developed countries. We call upon the communityof nations to redouble its efforts in this area.At the threshold of the new millennium  and inresponse to an international society that is increasinglyinterdependent  we call for a more equitable and justorder in the sphere of trade  with clear rules and equalopportunities for all regions and States. This is the onlyway to promote development in areas where there is an16imperative need to eliminate poverty and build more justsocieties.As the President of Colombia expressed very well inthis Assembly  development should take into account thehuman side of our societies. We must keep striving toaccomplish more internal equity in the distribution ofresources and burdens. But it is increasingly difficult  underpresent conditions  to comply with the demands of theinternational institutions that finance development  withoutsacrificing the lives of our people  who are already  for themost part  mired in poverty. We are also greatly alarmed tosee an insecure and uncertain worldwide economic situationin which dubious speculative practices continue to wreakhavoc in the absence of effective controls by thoseresponsible. The world is filling up with products thatpopulations and countries no longer have the means toacquire  and there is no longer any place for our smalleconomies.Now that the Central American countries are makingefforts on various fronts to accomplish our integration andliberalize our economies  and as we strive to leave years ofarmed confrontation behind us and adapt to the demands ofthe world market  our products must have fair  non-discriminatory access to world markets  and our potential asa competitive destination for productive investment must berecognized.One of the most important subjects on the agenda ofthe General Assembly is that of disarmament. Guatemala together with the other Central American countries condemns any type of nuclear testing. We expressed ourconcern over the recent tests carried out in other continents.Such activities do not contribute to the peace or the nucleardisarmament that most of the Member States of thisOrganization desire.Guatemala was also among the first countries to signthe Ottawa Convention prohibiting the manufacture and useof anti-personnel mines. We ask those countries that havenot yet done so to become parties to this Convention.We also note with great satisfaction that the concernsof Member States relating to the subject of weapons aregrowing in scope to include the proliferation  illegal trafficand abuse of small arms. Guatemala is extremely interestedin the quest for a solution to this problem  and we believethat the Oslo platform can generate satisfactory responses.We are extremely concerned to see that although to alarge extent it has been possible to overcome internalconflicts in most Member States  the internationalcommunity continues to be shocked by such horrendousacts of international terrorism as those that recentlycaused much bloodshed in Africa and Northern Ireland.In addition to condemning and unanimously rejectingthese vile and cowardly actions that primarily affectinnocent human beings who have nothing to do with thecauses that are invoked  the international community mustobserve the resolution of the Rome Conference on theStatute of the International Criminal Court to the effectthat“terrorist acts  by whomever and whereverperpetrated and whatever their forms  methods ormotives  are serious crimes of concern to theinternational community”. (A/Conf.183/10  annex I section E  second paragraph)As is well known  Guatemala was one of the laststaging grounds of the cold war  where transnationalnetworks operated with impunity in support of the dirtywar taking place inside and outside of the country. Wewish to express once again our firm and emphaticpolitical resolve that never again will our territory be usedto prepare any type of aggression against any othercountry.As the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights draws near  Guatemalareaffirms its resolute commitment to honouring theprinciples contained in the Declaration. One of the mostimportant tasks of the Government of President AlvaroArzú has been to promote fulfilment of and respect forhuman rights in all aspects of life in our country. Thehuman rights dimension has been integrated into allspheres of civic life  and  although we still have much todo in that area  we have certainly made great progress promoting the full blossoming of our rich ethnic multicultural and multilingual diversity.The United Nations  founded in 1945 on the ideal ofkeeping peace in the world and with the fundamental roleof ensuring that all nations can coexist on the basis ofmutual respect among States  is the highest expression ofrepresentation by all peoples. However  53 years after thebirth of the United Nations  there are still territorieswhose citizens are not represented here. My country isaware of the divisions that persist between brothers in theMiddle East  Asia and Africa. We hope that theirdifferences can be resolved through dialogue and in apeaceful manner  so that  without any form of rejection or17discrimination  all the peoples of the world may berepresented in the United Nations.I wish to mention in particular the situation of the 22million citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan  aswell as the importance and soundness of their economyamid so much financial uncertainty in that region.Our Organization must face great challenges as thenew century draws near. We hope that  with the goodwillof all Member States  we can resolutely embark on it so asto ensure the survival of the human race  as well as liveslived in peace  the protection of our environment  economicgrowth and sustainable development. Only in that way willwe achieve the dream of those who  full of ideals  foundedthe United Nations in San Francisco in 1945."
"71",2952,"GUY",53,1998,"In just 15 months  our world willenter a new millennium  leaving behind it a chequeredpast to face the challenges of a yet uncharted future. It isnot too early to contemplate this historic conjuncture andto give some thought to how best we may deal with theuncertainties ahead.This fifty-third session of the General Assemblyoffers  we believe  a timely opportunity for suchreflection. Your leadership  Mr. President  will beessential to the success of our exploration. We are assuredthat your diplomatic experience and skills  demonstratedin the service of your native Uruguay  will contributegreatly to the success of our deliberations.To your predecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of theUkraine  we offer our sincere appreciation and thanks forthe admirable guidance which he provided the Assemblyover the past year.Our gratitude is extended to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for the inspired direction which he hasgiven to our Organization. From the report that he hasbeen good enough to present us on the activities of thelast 12 months  we are able to see clearly those areaswhere our stated goals have been reached and  equallyimportantly  those which require our further attention andeffort.Certainly  among the developments that are mostheartening is the spread of democracy within recent times.It is a happy coincidence that this year we celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights which embodies the principles of democracy. Thedemocratic system has emerged as a popular form ofgovernment for many States Members of the UnitedNations. Guyana has rejoined this growing majority.Unfortunately  this had to come after hard struggles andour people experienced three decades of lost opportunitiesunder an undemocratic regime. Only last December  forthe second time this decade  elections were held underinternational scrutiny  leading to the re-election of my4Government to office. However  despite the fact that theoutcome was adjudged by international observers to be freeand fair  the minority opposition refuses to abide by theresult. Consequently  the will of the electorate has beenquestioned. Unfortunately  this negation of electionsconducted in a free and fair manner is not limited toGuyana and increasingly requires our attention. Naturally my Government cannot tolerate this state of affairs  norshould the United Nations  which by its Charter is calledupon to protect the gains of new and restored democracies.It is vital that the international community and theUnited Nations rally in support of our efforts to achievebetter governance and to guarantee the enjoyment of allhuman rights by our citizens. We need to go beyond theholding of periodic elections to ensuring the observance ofthe rule of law and building the institutions upon whichdemocracy must rest.Regrettably  many of our democracies are severelylimited  in terms of their own resources  in their ability tosatisfy these pressing needs. As a result  hard-won gains areunder constant threat of erosion. We firmly believe that itis in the interest of the international community as a wholeto assist in the strengthening of the democratic system as abulwark against encroachment by oppressive regimes. Onlythrough such cooperation can the democratic ideal take rootand flourish throughout the world. On our part  we willstaunchly defend the gains of our people and we areresolved not to allow ourselves to slide once again into thedarkness of dictatorship.Needless to say  the spread of democracy within Statesmust be matched by democracy among States. The UnitedNations was founded in 1945 on the premise of thesovereign equality of all States. This principle is the rockupon which international cooperation among peoples hasbeen built. In their operation  therefore  all organs andagencies within the international system must be cognizantof the views and wishes of all States. Developing countriesin particular need to be adequately represented in thesebodies to ensure that their concerns are addressed.In this scheme of things  we attach great importanceto reaching general agreement on how the Security Councilmust be transformed into an organ that enjoys theconfidence and support of all States. Clearly  the bodywhich was created in the aftermath of the Second WorldWar is no longer appropriate to the circumstances oftodayâs world. Sorely needed now is a more representativeand transparent Council that can adequately address newthreats to international peace and security. Accordingly  weencourage the Working Group that was created to reformthe Council to persist in its search for a suitably reformedCouncil.Our task is made especially urgent by the realizationthat  despite our perseverance  the achievement ofinternational peace and security remains a frustrating will-oâ-the-wisp. There are today more peacekeepingoperations than the international community appears ableor willing to sustain. Some have been reasonablysuccessful  and  others appear to promise eventualsettlement. Most  however  seem to be ending with littleto show for the considerable investment of time andmoney.One can only conclude from these varying resultsthat increasingly we will have to turn to preventivediplomacy  peacemaking and peace-building to fullyaddress and treat the root causes of tension.We are also constantly reminded that notwithstanding the abatement in East-West tensions  thedangers of a nuclear catastrophe are still very real andpresent. It is impossible to guarantee  in an unstable worldsuch as ours  that nuclear weapons will not be used  eitherintentionally or inadvertently. Only a complete prohibitionof such weapons  binding upon all States  can reduce therisk of nuclear disaster. My Government therefore urgesthe international community to move swiftly to a totalelimination of these weapons coupled with an undertakingto discontinue their production.At the same time  we must redouble our efforts tocurb the flow of conventional weapons  which serves tofuel conflagrations in trouble spots throughout the world.We must also intensify our search for a collective systemof security upon which all States can rely for protection.Peace  as has been so aptly said  is not the mereabsence of war. True peace can only come if it is built ona foundation of sound economic and social development.The foremost obstacle to peace is poverty  which  whenit can be borne no longer  explodes with a vengeance. Itis imperative  therefore  that the problem of poverty besquarely addressed by the United Nations with a view tohalving its incidence by the year 2015. Reaching thistarget will require concerted action by both developed anddeveloping countries. The developed countries have avested interest in the economic prosperity of developingcountries  since they represent important markets for theirexports. A renewal of the dialogue between the industrialand the developing nations is urgently needed to achieve5the eradication of poverty. My Government intends to makethis a primary goal during this yearâs session of theAssembly.Notwithstanding the onerous debt obligations and aphysical infrastructure which we are tackling as a priority Guyana has come a long way in overcoming poverty andmaximizing its full growth potential. Thus  we continue torely heavily on external assistance for our economicdevelopment. We are therefore particularly concerned bythe rapid diminution of resources made available forfinancing by both bilateral donors and multilateral agencies.While private investment flows have a role to play in thedevelopment process  they are still far too selective to be ofbenefit to weak economies. We need to be assured of thecontinued provision of official development assistance sufficient investment flows  technological transfer and tradeopportunities that would allow for adequate development.As we move into the next century  we have torecognize the reality that developing countries are extremelyvulnerable to changes in the world economy. The presentcourse of globalization and liberalization has led tomarginalization of the poorer countries. Guyana is a case inpoint. We have returned to the democratic fold and haveachieved fairly high growth rates despite structuraladjustment programmes. But after a few years  we are nowfaced with a steep drop in prices of our main exportcommodities  the drying up of developmental aid  adverseglobal weather conditions and so forth. At the end of theday  our people face tremendous hardships.We are being told that growing investment is needed.We open our economies to work with the private sector fordevelopment  and we see investment being directed awayfrom the poorer countries  making them incapable ofmodernizing their economies. There is a need for a globalconsensus to assist developing countries to complete theirtransition so that they can be equal players in theglobalization process.The alternative is to continue to ignore the dangersignals which are becoming more and more evident. And as usual  the rich countries will be able to solve theirproblems  but will do so at the expense of the poorercountries. The gap between the poor and rich will becomegreater  and conflicts will continue. The narcotics trade mass migration  international crime  poverty and other illswill put severe strains on new and restored democracies.As we have become painfully aware  threats to ourenvironment also impinge on our peace and security. Globalwarming and climate changes have increased thevulnerability of small States such as Guyana to a wave ofnatural disasters. The El NiÃ±o phenomenon recentlyinflicted on our country a period of intense drought taking a heavy toll on our economy.In our continuing efforts to develop our country andmeet the needs of our people  especially those living inpoverty  my country remains dedicated to the preservationof the environment and the sustainable development ofour resources. We are concerned  therefore  that when weseek to exploit our forest and other resources for thebenefit of our people  we face criticisms from those whoaccuse us of disregard for the environment.These reproaches are entirely ill-informed  if notmischievous. A land of abundant and pristine forests Guyana runs no risk of deforestation. We have in fact putin place firm legislative and administrative arrangementsto ensure the conservation of our natural resources.Moreover  under the Iwokrama rain forest project  wehave set aside almost a million acres of these forests forresearch by the international community into thepreservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of theforests.The four pillars which I have listed â€” democracy economic and social development  human rights and theelimination of poverty â€” are indispensable to theconstruction of peace. Events in the post-war period havenot only confirmed this fact  but have also shown that thebuilding of peace and development must be the work ofthe international community. Persuaded of the need forenhanced multilateralism  my Government is committedto the realization of the late President Cheddi Jaganâsvision of a new global human order. The thrust of hisproposal sought to reduce the ever widening anddangerous gap which exists between countries in theNorth and those in the South.Recalling the Marshall Plan  which served to rebuildEurope from the ashes of the Second World War Mr. Jagan argued for a similar enterprise to eradicatepoverty  promote good governance and bring developmentto all peoples. Only through such enlightened cooperationcan the world enjoy the blessings of peace. I wish therefore  to renew his plea and to call for earlyagreement on the establishment of a more just andequitable system of international relations. With thenecessary determination and effort  we can make thetwenty-first century a golden age for all humanity.6"
"72",2998,"HND",53,1998,"I am pleased and honoured to convey a cordialand respectful greeting from the people and Government ofthe Republic of Honduras and from the other countries thatare members of the Central American Integration System of which I am proud to be the current Chairman.Mr. President  Central America wishes to express itssatisfaction at your well-deserved election to preside overthis fifty-third regular session of the General Assembly.Your outstanding professional and public career is aguarantee that this session of the Assembly will yieldfruitful and significant results.Our delegation wishes also to express its gratitude tothe representative of the Ukraine  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for the commendable work he did during the last GeneralAssembly. We also express our sincerest gratitude to Mr.Kofi Annan  who  in discharging his mandate as Secretary-General of our Organization  has displayed a spirit of hardwork and dedication in a particularly difficult period for theUnited Nations.Throughout its history  Honduras has fought for thesystem of democratic government to take root on its soil. Ithas fought to take its place in the world community as afully fledged State  to imbue its independent  republicancharacter with respect for basic human rights  and to ensurepublic freedoms for all of its inhabitants. However  manyof those efforts were frustrated at certain regrettable timesin our past  a past that was closely interlinked with that ofthe other States of the Central American region.Fortunately  in recent decades Honduras has safeguardedand strengthened its democracy and its internal institutions in spite of the deplorable and difficult circumstancesexperienced by the Central American region as theinvoluntary theatre of the cold war  which was imposed onus from outside  and in spite of the undesirableconsequences of armed conflicts.The Governments of Central America are currentlyworking hard to consolidate peace and a spirit of internalreconciliation in our societies. Our resolve is strong in thisprocess  and the progress achieved is truly encouraging anda just reward for these efforts. We are determined to turnaway forever from the fratricidal battles that have caused usso much suffering and diverted our energy from theconstruction of the prosperous  democratic  free andhappy region that our peoples yearn for and that theirdemocratic Governments strive to offer.It must be said that although Honduras was not thedirect scene of Central American armed conflicts  it didsuffer the grave consequences of the instability uncertainty and violence of the region  which causedthousands of Hondurans to emigrate to other countries mainly to the United States. Unfortunately  justice has notbeen done to our compatriots  as they have not been giventhe same opportunities and immigration status enjoyed byother Central Americans. We trust that the sacrifice ofHonduras in the Central American conflicts of the pastwill be fully understood and that our emigrants will begiven the consideration that they justly deserve.Furthermore  the Presidents of Central America  inongoing consultations and regular meetings  are givingstrong impetus to regional integration in all fields:economic  political  social and cultural. These dynamicsof integration include the States of Belize  Panama andthe Dominican Republic  through broad participationmechanisms and the signing of economic treaties and ofbilateral and multinational exchanges. We are hoping alsofor a joint venture with the Mexican Republic  and wemaintain that the region as a whole must enjoy the samebenefits that the three principal North American countrieshave already agreed upon for themselves.The Government of Honduras commends theSecretary-General of the United Nations and fullysupports his efforts to reform the Organization. There isconsensus in Central America on the fact that UnitedNations reform  including broader membership of theSecurity Council  is a necessity for the internationalsystem. But this expansion must be based upon equitablegeographic representation and the consensus of theregional groups and the existing subregional mechanisms.The restructuring must also include a procedural reviewin order to ensure greater representation  transparency andefficiency.The Government of Honduras supports the initiativeof the President of the United States to establish aworldwide organization to fight against terrorism. Westrongly condemn all types of terrorism without exceptionbecause we believe it is a form of human cruelty that nopolitical  ideological  religious or cultural cause canjustify at this stage of our civilization.6On the subject of controlling illegal drug trafficking our Government reiterates its support for the special sessionof the General Assembly on the world drug problem.Because of its strategic geographic position  CentralAmerica is in danger of becoming a production and tradearea for narcotic drugs and must therefore receive thegreatest possible international support to fight this scourge.We are pleased also at the advances achieved by theDiplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on theEstablishment of an International Criminal Court  held inRome  whose goal was to create a legal forum with globaljurisdiction in order to bring to trial and convict individualsfor war crimes and crimes against humanity.The Honduran people themselves have suffered fromthe use of anti-personnel mines  which have taken a hightoll in human lives. Consequently  we are prepared tosupport the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-PersonnelMines and on Their Destruction. The Government ofHonduras is proud to announce that today it has depositedwith the Secretary-General its instrument of ratification ofthe landmines Convention.The countries of the Central American Region viewwith concern and deplore the recent nuclear tests conductedin other geographical regions  and we advocate theintroduction and full implementation of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as an important step towards thetotal elimination of these devastating weapons.Honduras supports the efforts of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan for full membership in the United Nations andin the international agencies of the United Nations system.We are convinced that conditions have changedsignificantly and that at this time in our history there can beno justification for the international isolation to which morethan 21 million people are subjected.Among other noteworthy issues is the advancement ofwomen in society. We welcome this advancement not onlybecause women have the right to equality  but also becausewith their help we can envision a fairer and more humaneworld. We invite States to support the Platform for Actionin the effective implementation of the Fourth WorldConference on Women.Likewise  because children and adolescents are themost vulnerable members of society  we are prepared tolend our vigorous support to the convening of a worldconference of ministers responsible for youth  with a viewto the implementation of national programmes and of theWorld Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000and Beyond  and in order to support the institutions andprogrammes designed to safeguard our children andyoung people as the generational and spiritual reserve ofour homeland.Globalization is a subject of particular concern thatmust be tackled in this unique forum — so vital tohumankind — because it gives rise to challenges of anunprecedented magnitude.It is true that humankind has always faced singularchallenges throughout the millennium that is now drawingto a close. Major worldwide events have occurred thathave drastically changed the way of life of millions ofpeople: the Christian revolution  in the spiritual realm; theliberal revolutions of France and the United States  in thepolitical realm; the Industrial Revolution  in the economicrealm; and the Russian Revolution  in the social realm.Each of these historic events affected in a different wayhumankind?s self-image and the role of States ingoverning society.Thus  the twentieth century — which saw greatachievements  serious errors  titanic efforts  enormousupheavals and profuse bloodshed — is now drawing to aclose. We are about to open a new chapter forhumankind  one that is replete with uncertainty expectations  fears and hopes — the first century of theapproaching third millennium.The twentieth century will bequeath to futuregenerations a legacy without parallel or comparison in thehistory of human development. This is the century thattook us to the very depth of the microcosmos through thesplitting of the atom and the deciphering of the geneticcode  allowing us to unravel the components of matterand discover and use an impressive number of new andeven-made elements with the help of innovative formulasfor nuclear energy  light  heat and sound. It has been acentury of great discoveries in all the sciences —mathematics  physics  medicine  chemistry  optics genetics  psychology and electronics.This is the century of the outer space and man?sdaring probes and adventures of man beyond his planet.This is the century of vertiginous speeds that broke thesound barrier and of communications and transport thathave  indeed  transformed the earth into a global village.It is the century of universal cybernetic information which has connected man with his neighbour in the other7hemisphere  just as two friends used to talk in their backyards  separated only by a garden fence. Today  thecomputer performs tasks that would have taken the mostcultivated and talented man centuries of work  or that hewould have never been able to perform. Races and cultureshave been mixed  influencing each other in an unceasingexchange of creations. There has been a massive spreadingof ideas  news  customs and new developments such as mannever dreamed of accomplishing in the course of his longand trying existence on earth. This is the century ofgeopolitical changes  as sudden as they are unimaginable so huge that their very force left their own protagonistsbehind.Unfortunately  it is also a century that will beremembered with sadness  as the century of the two greatworldwide slaughters and many dreadful  apparently localand centralized  wars. It is the century of thermonuclear toxic and chemical weapons and other means of massdestruction. It is the century of merciless  senselessterrorism  and also the century of the terrible AIDSpandemic. It is the century  finally  of man?s greatestdestruction of the ecology and of the purity of hisenvironment  seriously threatening the very existence of hisplanet. We are concerned  and we are surely ashamed  thatthis century will also be remembered as the century of thedirest poverty in an alarming majority of countries. We aregrieved that when there is prosperity  it is concentratedamong the richest  but when there is a crisis  on the otherhand  its devastation is brought down on the poorest.But if there is one issue that characterizes this centuryand for ever marks it in the annals of the human race  it isthe desire for  the necessity of and the value of freedom.Never have we fought so hard and paid such a high pricefor freedom  or for the lack thereof  as we have done in thiscentury. Never have there been so many attempts to destroyfreedom through systems  ideologies  regimes and wars  andnever has man carried out such monumental exploits  suchbeautiful and heroic deeds  in the defence or pursuit ofliberty  as in the last 10 decades of this millennium. Thegreat figures that left their mark on contemporary historyare those who denied freedom to their nations or achievedit gloriously  sometimes at the cost of their own lives.Thank God that we can say at this time  and in thisworld forum  that freedom has triumphed and will continueto establish itself in every corner of the world where it isstill denied or crushed  whenever conditions show ourpeoples that freedom  an essential human value  is worththe trouble and that to fight for it and to keep it areimportant for man?s physical and spiritual well-being.Along with freedom  democracy is triumphingaround the globe  but for this progress to continue to beeffective and to last  so that we do not lose what we havegained and do not return to the tyrannies we defeatedwith so much effort and suffering  certain conditions mustbe fulfilled. This is the huge challenge of the nextmillennium: how to keep this freedom  how to extend itto the farthest corner of the planet and — the final test —how to manage it for the benefit of all humankind.It is true that  just as there are hopeful andencouraging expectations on which we must capitalize there is also a lot of worry  and even fear  in our nationsconcerning these swift  radical and dizzying universalchanges. The world economy has progressed anddeveloped dramatically in the last 25 years. Economicglobalization has opened up opportunities and risks for allthe countries of the world. However  at this time it isquite clear that the benefits of globalization are not sharedby all countries and that  in many cases  there is anincreasing disparity between developed and developingcountries  an inequality that produces social and politicaltensions in our countries and severely threatens thedemocratic advances for which we have paid so dearly.In the beginning of the process of globalliberalization  it was maintained that the reduction in theflows of assistance for development would be faroutweighed by the commercial benefits and private capitalflows to our regions. The truth is that  even though wesupport commercial liberalization with concrete measures our products have often been faced with various kinds ofbarriers that are hard to overcome.In combination  factors such as the reduction indevelopment assistance  barriers to the export of ourproducts  the scanty movement of private capital or itsexcessive concentration in certain areas  and the burdenof foreign debt become formidable obstacles to theeconomic growth and social development of our peoples.I believe the time is ripe to evaluate what is happening atthe global level in order to take measures that willprevent further deterioration of the living conditions ofour population and promote a more just economic andsocial order.This concern is especially legitimate in the light offinancial developments in recent days in certain countriesof South-East Asia and Japan. Those economies andsystems were held up to us as an example to follow andas a standard for what can be achieved with full economicliberalization. Russia followed that path that led to the8crisis affecting us today  which we all hope is temporary.All of this means that the economy is not everything  andthat a setback in maintaining the welfare level of a people?swell-being because of economic and financial mechanismscan rapidly deteriorate its political and social conditions presenting the imminent danger of moving backwards in thedevelopment of democracy and imperilling once again theprecious gift of freedom  for which millions of men andwomen have given their lives in this century. Creating greatexpectations and exaggerated hopes of well-being anddevelopment is dangerous  as are the disappointments thatcan be felt by our peoples when the democratic system andthe new economic order are incapable of giving concreteanswers to the basic needs of our nations. This is the riskof backlash  the reversal of conquests and the return toinstability  rivalry  mistrust and the loss of internal  andeven international  peace.Under the pressure of globalization  modernization andeconomic adjustments  we have surely put at stake millionsof the planet?s inhabitants? right to better life especially inLatin America. At stake is the national identity of countriesand the identity of regions faced with an increasingly rapidprocess of universalization and assimilation  which is notalways laudable. At stake is the vulnerability or resistanceof our societies before the avalanche of influences requirements and models imposed from the outside  behindthe mask of structural adjustments and modernization. Atstake is stability: we are faced with the massivedevelopment of violent  or simply rebellious  acts of thepoor  the marginalized and the excluded  because they feelpowerless before the walls that prevent their access tosurvival  work  education  health and safety  which areessential  basic rights  amply consecrated by the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  whose fiftieth anniversary weHondurans have celebrated with the greatest pleasure andwith renewed hope that such principles can actually lead usto fairer  happier societies.We cannot hide the fear  shared by many of theGovernments represented here  that a new economic orderthat is unfair  oversized and all-encompassing  and that doesnot take into consideration the political and social realitiesof each country and the processes that led us to thesevertiginous changes  would destroy any possibility for theequitable development of each person and each people  tothe extent that globalization generates excessiveconcentrations of power in large and monstrousconsortiums  instead of solidarity in the enjoyment of thegoods and opportunities afforded by a new  universalsociety.Whether we are moving towards an ideal  globalized fraternal and peaceful world of solidarity  or towardsother forms of tyranny  submission and cruelty — this isthe question we must ask  all of us who have publicresponsibilities in Honduras and in every corner of theplanet. In a world where the borders no longer dividecountries  but rather swell to embrace the geographiccontours of the planet  in a world in which the scope ofinternational relations is limited only by human ambitionand imagination  the question is whether we are headingfor the globalization of ethics or an ethics ofglobalization. This question must be answered if we areto avoid the death  in the vortex of capital and marketgrowth  of humankind?s ethical and moral values  whichhave been the pillars that prevent the crumbling of whatwe all call civilization.At issue  in short  is the ability to govern societies but without losing the freedoms that gave birth to States and without losing the ethical values that have kept themalive  sheltered by eternal concepts such as nationalsovereignty  basic human rights  the survival of the planetand the self-determination of peoples.After all  in the hierarchy of the values that defineour highest aspirations  the supreme goal of society andState continues to be the human person  and the supremegood we are trying to achieve is not growth  notdevelopment  not globalization  but happiness and well-being.This is the right time  then  to seek alternatives suchas the needed reinforcement of multilateral institutionswith funds on preferential terms to support development;increased cooperation in order to foster betteropportunities for those most in need and to reduceimbalances and close the distance between the richest andthe poorest; the governing of globalization so that it doesnot demand sacrifices from most nations whileconcentrating its benefits in a few; and the search foradditional  expeditious mechanisms to reduce the foreigndebt that is choking most of humankind. The UnitedNations must become the appropriate forum to fosterthese and other initiatives required to guarantee betterconditions for developing countries  intelligent measuresto ensure universal peace and harmony.Honduras  its people and its Government  declaretheir faith in the superior qualities of man and hiscapacity for hope and faith in a better destiny for allhumankind. We are sure that the unity of all the peoplesof the earth around the essential topics of peace  survival9of the planet  a worldwide economic system that is morebalanced and really open to all and the construction ofsocieties that are fairer  freer  and safer will remain theraison d?être of the United Nations and its most importanttask. In this effort  the Organization can count on thesupport and solidarity of Honduras and other CentralAmerican States."
"73",3022,"HRV",53,1998,"Let me first extend my sincerecongratulations to the new President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session  His ExcellencyMr. Didier Opertti  Minister for Foreign Affairs ofUruguay. I am confident that his diplomatic experience willplay an important role in the work of the Assembly. At thesame time  I would like to thank Mr. Hennadiy Y.Udovenko of Ukraine for the skilful manner in which hepresided over the work of the fifty-second session of theGeneral Assembly.I welcome the opportunity to address the GeneralAssembly on behalf of a nation that has emerged more vitalthan ever before from one of the worst regional crises sincethe Second World War. The free and sovereign Croatia oftoday harbours a vibrant market place of ideas  innovativeeconomic and rich social and cultural practices. We arelearning that democracy means the right to both rationaland what at times might appear irrational choices. We arelearning that the free-market economy is both a prospect forsuccess and a risk of failure.Positive results are already visible. Croatia of today although still burdened by the multiple tasks of transition reconstruction  the return of refugees and displacedpersons and reconciliation  stands firmly rooted in thematuring Central European polity and economy. Croatialooks with ambition and sharpened senses towardsreclaiming its place in the old Europe and contributing tothe new Europe and the global community.Since ancient times Croatia has been a Europeancountry. Integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions remainsour strategic goal. Therefore  Croatia will continue tomarch towards it  being devoted to its high standards andcommitted to its principles. This year Croatia is presidingover the Central European initiative with a great sense ofresponsibility. Furthermore  Croatia hopes to join theWorld Trade Organization soon.As a Central European and Mediterranean country Croatia will further endeavour to remain a key agent ofstability and peace in this part of the world. Through itsresponsible policy towards the crisis which has markedthe recent history of this part of Europe  Croatia hasaffirmed its indispensable role in the most importantpolitical developments in this region.Even though the war is behind us  Croatia is stillgrappling with the legacies of aggression  such as theproblems of devastated economic infrastructure  missingpersons  ongoing assistance to war victims and invalidsand the return of displaced persons and refugees. Thismeans that my country is undergoing a double transitionat the same time. The transition from war to peace isequally complex and demanding.In June this year  the national Programme for theReturn and Accommodation of Displaced Persons Refugees and Exiled Persons was adopted  and  aseverybody agrees  it is being successfully implemented.So far  more than 45 000 Croatian Serbs have returned.Croatian authorities are also taking numerous steps andmeasures to encourage the process of reconciliation. Asuccessful donors’ conference on reconstruction  to beheld later this fall  should further contribute to theongoing process of return and normalization of daily life especially in the war-affected areas.Croatia is increasingly focusing on post-warreconstruction  economic growth and development  aswell as on the overall normalization of relations with itsneighbours to the east and south. But it must be stressedthat full normalization of relations with neighbouring34countries has always been a cornerstone of our policiesfrom the very outset.Croatia was not only the first country to recognizeBosnia and Herzegovina as an independent and sovereigncountry  but it has also helped Bosnia and Herzegovinamore than any other party in its struggle to survive withinits internationally recognized borders. Hence  let me repeatthat for the Republic of Croatia as a guarantor of theDayton Peace Agreement  the following basic principlesremain paramount: first  Bosnia and Herzegovina as asingle  internationally recognized State; second  thedecentralization of State apparatus; and third  full equalityof the three constituent peoples. Croatia cannot support anysolution for Bosnia and Herzegovina that does not fullyincorporate these founding principles or that in any wayamounts to a revision of the Dayton principles. Deviationsfrom or tacit abrogation of these principles can be bothdamaging and destabilizing not only to Bosnia andHerzegovina itself  but also to the other countries in theregion.Croatia firmly believes that the recent elections inBosnia and Herzegovina will further contribute to lastingstability and security. The agreement on free transit throughthe territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina at Neum and useof the Croatian port of Ploce  which will be formally signedshortly  is yet another example of good-neighbourlyrelations between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.Croatia has signed an agreement on the State to StateCouncil on Cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina.Croatia supports the efforts by the Office of the HighRepresentative  United Nations representatives and thepeacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina and shallspare no effort in doing what is in its power to help themfulfil their mandate.We have come a long way in our bilateral relationswith our eastern neighbour  the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia. Since the end of hostilities  10 bilateralagreements have been signed. We hope that the lastoutstanding issue  concerning the security arrangement forthe Prevlaka area  will be negotiated promptly. Negotiationsformally began on 15 September 1998. Croatia stands readynot only to open the border crossings with the Republic ofMontenegro  but also to continue with demilitarization onour side of the border and with the present security regimecurrently administered by United Nations Mission ofObservers in Prevlaka (UNMOP). Whether it is throughsuccessful bilateral negotiations with the Federal Republicof Yugoslavia  through the Security Council or eventhrough unilateral action consistent with the rights andduties of Croatia under international law  the UNMOPmandate should terminate by 15 January 1999  because inthe present circumstances another prolongation of themandate can be misused to stall negotiations indefinitely.The other United Nations mission in the Republic ofCroatia  the United Nations Civilian Police (UNCIVPOL) with a mandate in the Croatian Danubian region  isapproaching its final stage  after having successfullycompleted its task in that part of Croatia and  togetherwith recently adopted measures by the CroatianGovernment  having helped create conditions forreconciliation and a comprehensive return process.Termination of both United Nations missions will bea new landmark in the life of our country and willconfirm once again its sovereignty and integrity over itsentire territory.While it has lent its full support and cooperation tothe International Criminal Tribunal for the formerYugoslavia  Croatia is not satisfied with its results thusfar. Indictments issued so far do not adequately reflect thescope of war crimes committed by different sides in theconflict nor the level of involvement. The Republic ofCroatia helped to persuade 11 Bosnian Croats tovoluntarily surrender to The Hague Tribunal. Three ofthem have been acquitted while the rest have beenawaiting trial for over 12 months  much longer than usualin any individual State. On top of that  not a singleperson — despite promises made as far back as theDayton negotiations — has been charged for crimescommitted against Bosnian Croats. Furthermore  only oneSerb was brought to The Hague for crimes committedduring the aggression against Croatia  but he died inprison and was never sentenced.The most notorious perpetrators of war crimes andcrimes against humanity — Karadzic  Mladic andMartic — still remain at large  and in many cases in fullview of the international community.The Republic of Croatia shares the concern of theinternational community on the rapidly worseningsituation in Kosovo and the impending threat tointernational peace and security. As a neighbouringcountry of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  Croatia isvitally interested in a speedy resolution of the crisis. Wejoin the international community in condemning violationsof human rights in Kosovo  and we denounce all forms ofterrorism  regardless of whether they are committed by aState  a group or an individual  bearing in mind that State35terrorism represents the most dangerous form of terrorism due to the resources available to States. Croatia supports apeaceful and negotiated solution that would respect both theterritorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslaviaand the rights of Kosovo Albanians to autonomy. Croatiais alarmed at the imminent humanitarian catastrophe  whichneeds urgent and determined international action.The twentieth century can boast of tremendousachievements in various fields on the individual as well asthe collective level  while awareness of globalinterdependence in every respect is growing.However  we must face the fact that we are alsowitnesses to the negative legacies of the twentieth century:the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; terrorism;narcotics production  trafficking and consumption; laggingdevelopment; disregard for the environment; the rise oftransnational crime; and continued grave breaches offundamental human rights and humanitarian law.On the fiftieth anniversary of United Nationspeacekeeping and the adoption of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights  let us ask ourselves: what is the UnitedNations  what does it really do? I agree with those whostrongly believe that the United Nations is not only a globalOrganization in which Governments exchange views muster support for their policies and views or trade in votesand influence. The United Nations is much more than anOrganization; it is a living idea for a better world.Values do matter.Like all organizations  the United Nations has aged and its structure and mechanisms have become anywherefrom slightly to grossly obsolete. To meet the challengesand needs of the emerging global society at the turn of thecentury  the United Nations must evolve just as quickly orrisk being overtaken by other institutions or initiatives thatmay or may not be universal in scope  and may or may notmore faithfully reflect the credo of a better world for all ofus. It is high time that we again acted as “We the peoples”.It is Croatia’s view that the reform of the UnitedNations should take many forms and focus not only on theneeds of the Organization — that is  on the fulfilment of itslegislative mandates — but also on increasing itseffectiveness on the global stage. The Secretary-General hasdone his part  and it is now up to each and every one ofus — as nations  as peoples  as individuals — to partake inreforming the United Nations for the next millennium.The reform of the Security Council remainsimperative. While the founding principle of the sovereignequality of States must be strictly maintained  both thestructure and operation of the Security Council must beharmonized with the new realities in international affairs.Interdependence  liberalization of polities and markets andthe profoundly widened access to instantaneouscommunication all demand that the function and use ofthe veto power be readjusted  and that this pivotal worldbody operate in a more transparent  representative andotherwise democratic structure. Croatia thus supports theenlargement of the Security Council in both categories permanent and non-permanent  fully in line with itsrepeatedly declared positions.Several important world conferences have been heldunder United Nations auspices in the past decade; thetime has come to implement the findings and evaluate theresults of those conferences.We firmly believe that the role of the Economic andSocial Council remains important to the well-being of thisOrganization and its Members. Although Croatia hasincreased its presence in United Nations expert bodies including two commissions of the Economic and SocialCouncil  we can do and wish to do more. Hence  Croatiaattaches paramount importance to its candidature for theEconomic and Social Council for the years 2000-2002.The need for further improvement of internationalsecurity structures and mechanisms deserves our specialattention. If it has been identified with anything  theUnited Nations has been widely identified with itspeacekeeping role. Nowadays  as we approach the end ofthe active and  by general estimation  highly successfulUnited Nations peacekeeping presence in Croatia  theCroatian Government and people feel very strongly thatthe time has come for Croatia to pay back in kind someof the good deeds bestowed on us by the United Nationscommunity. It was with a sense of pride andresponsibility that I submitted a letter to the SecretaryGeneral earlier today  formally notifying him of Croatia’sreadiness to join the ranks of peacekeeping contributorcountries.Disarmament and international security issues arecritically important in our efforts to preserve peace andenhance stability in the increasingly volatile world.Croatia is particularly concerned about the problemof landmines. We still suffer from the consequences ofmore than 2 million mines scattered all over our countryduring the imposed war. A lot of work has been done to36alleviate the problem  but many areas have not yet beencleared. This situation adversely affects the process ofreturn of displaced people and refugees and slows downeconomic reconstruction and development. The sheermagnitude of this problem requires a more forceful andresourceful global response  be it financial or technical.Croatia ratified the Ottawa Convention in May 1998 andstrongly supports the efforts in the Conference onDisarmament to start negotiations on a global ban bybuilding on the achievements of the Ottawa process.The developments in disarmament  non-proliferationand international security since our last session can be acause of great concern. International terrorism is anotherthreat to security and peace in the world. Croatia joinsothers in unequivocally condemning all forms of terrorism regardless of their motives or origin. Croatia also supportsthe strengthening of international cooperation in order tobring those responsible to justice and prevent furtherabhorrent acts of violence. My Government has ratified allmajor anti-terrorist treaties and actively participates in thecurrent work on a nuclear terrorism convention.Croatia joins the rest of the world in commemoratingthe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights. In the past 50 years it has become obviousthat we should all work hard to establish efficientmechanisms for the protection of human rights. Moreobjective criteria must be developed for their evaluation inorder to avoid politicization and establish a universalstandard in human rights.In November 1997  Croatia ratified the EuropeanConvention for the Protection of Human Rights andFundamental Freedoms  and accepted the competence of theEuropean Court of Human Rights and the EuropeanCommission of Human Rights to deal with individual cases.Croatia has also ratified the Framework Convention for theProtection of National Minorities and the European Charterfor Regional or Minority Languages.Croatia welcomes the results of the Rome Conferenceon the establishment of an International Criminal Court  andthanks the host country  Italy  for its generous hospitality.Although not all aspirations could be fully accommodatedin Rome  the establishment of an efficient  permanentInternational Criminal Court will be a milestone in themarch towards the universal protection of human rights andthe rule of law. Croatia intends to sign and ratify theStatute of the court in the near future and calls on otherStates to do the same.The role of the United Nations remains of vitalimportance for the world today. Under its auspices  manypraiseworthy achievements have been made in variousfields. The United Nations has played an important rolein Croatia  in time of war as well as now  when its twomissions are about to complete their mandates. TheUnited Nations presence in Croatia will continue at alevel of partnership in addressing social and  especially development questions. Only a strong and reformedOrganization will be able to adequately meet theincreasing and changing needs of its Member States.In conclusion  therefore I would like to say againthat values do matter. We the peoples are capable of trulyreforming the United Nations. We both need and deservea United Nations that is able and equipped to meet thechallenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century."
"74",3067,"HTI",53,1998,"It is a true pleasure for me to address the GeneralAssembly once more. I wish first of all to echo previousspeakers in congratulating you most warmly  Sir  on behalfof my delegation  on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. I take thisopportunity also to express our gratitude to His ExcellencyMr. Hennadiy Udovenko for the excellent work carried outunder his presidency.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  wereaffirm our confidence in his outstanding endeavours topreserve peace and to promote development.To all participants in the fifty-third session  I wish thegreatest success in the interests of all our peoples.Ten days ago hurricane Georges passed through theCaribbean region  striking several of our countries with itsfury and leaving considerable damage in its wake. I wish toexpress deepest sympathy  on behalf of Haiti  to ourbrotherly Governments and peoples who  like us  were sohard hit by this unavoidable disaster.The provisional toll in Haiti is quite heavy: 150 deadand dozens missing — more than 500 000 victims all told.There was considerable material damage to agriculture andto infrastructure: roads and bridges were destroyed andcrops devastated in several regions. The total cost of theselosses is estimated at approximately $200 million.International solidarity was quickly displayed in thewake of this disaster. I would therefore like to thank all thefriendly Governments  international institutions and non-governmental organizations for the support they have givenus thus far.While the present situation is serious  our concern forthe future is even greater. With over 60 per cent of ouragricultural production destroyed  the outlook is extremelybleak. We fear that once emergency aid is no longer beingprovided in the coming months there will be a severeshortage of foodstuffs and basic goods. We therefore appealto the international community to extend considerableassistance to our efforts to restore and rebuild the affectedzones and to support our measures to solve the publichealth problems that will arise. In this regard  we invitedelegations to support draft resolution A/53/L.2/Rev.1 which will soon be introduced to the General Assembly as a first step in this direction.Profound changes have taken place in internationalrelations in the course of the last 10 years. The lesseningof ideological confrontation and the strengthening ofinterdependence among nations have provided newopportunities for closer cooperation among States. Thephenomenon of globalization  which is characterized byunprecedented ties between human activities throughoutthe world  has expanded further and has been propelledby spectacular growth in communications.Some had anticipated a more peaceful and unitedworld in the next century. Yet  less than 500 days awayfrom the year 2000  the international picture is franklydisconcerting. New hotbeds of tension have arisen inmany regions of the world  while no substantial progresshas been made to resolve various age-old conflicts. Thatis the case in the Middle East  where we hope that therecent discussions held this week in Washington willserve to permanently revive the peace process that hasbeen stalled for more than a year.We deplore the armed conflicts that have broughtuntold suffering on populations  be it in Kosovo  Angola Afghanistan  the Great Lakes region or elsewhere. TheRepublic of Haiti invites the parties concerned to seek asolution to their problems through dialogue. Theinternational community must also continue to carry outefforts to restore peace to these regions.International terrorism  of which we had hoped tohave seen the last  has re-emerged in a troubling fashionwith the terrible events that have taken place in Africaand Northern Ireland. In condemning these acts  Haiticalls on the international community to adopt effectivemeasures to combat this threat to international security.Elsewhere  the world is facing a real challengewhose consequences are incalculable on more than onefront. I am referring to drug-trafficking and its relatedcrimes — arms-trafficking  organized crime and money-laundering.The problem of drug-trafficking continues to threatenthe integrity of our territories  to weaken the foundationsof our societies and to undermine the health of ourpeoples. Combating this scourge requires furthercooperation at the bilateral  regional and internationallevels  as was highlighted at the special session of theGeneral Assembly devoted to the drugs problem. Haiti 8which has unfortunately been used as a transit country forsome of the drugs headed for markets in consumercountries  has adopted a vigorous policy that has alreadybegun to bear fruit. This involves the drafting of legislativemeasures against drug-trafficking and money-laundering;the establishment of a body entrusted with combatingtrafficking in narcotic drugs; the development ofcooperation with neighbouring countries; and accession tointernational instruments in this area.In speaking of the dangers threatening the future ofmankind  I must refer here to the existence of considerablestockpiles of weapons of mass destruction  in particularnuclear weapons. The Republic of Haiti welcomes therecent progress achieved in the reduction of these weapons.It will continue to support wholeheartedly the efforts of theinternational community for their complete elimination.In this connection  Haiti deplored the nuclear testsrecently carried out by India and Pakistan  which havecontributed to increasing tensions in that part of the world.It invites those countries to become parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to sign theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.The global economic situation at the end of thiscentury has also given rise to many concerns. Thephenomenon of globalization  which is characterized by aliberalization of market forces  which  according tonumerous observers  should accelerate growth and promotedevelopment  has above all been marked by greaterinequality and sluggish growth. The income gap betweenNorth and South has continued to widen. In 1965 theaverage per capita income in the G-7 countries was 20times that of the world’s seven poorest countries; by 1995that figure had almost doubled.Today poverty continues to grow throughout theworld. Entire populations are victims of the seriousproblems of malnutrition and abject poverty. Health careand education are inaccessible to millions of people. Therehas been further destruction of the environment throughoutthe world  threatening the very survival of mankind. Evenmore than the countries of the third world  which have beenbattered by these global developments  the least developedcountries — including my country  Haiti — find themselvesever more marginalized and must face a worsening of thestandard of living of their peoples. The feeling of despairis increasingly spreading among younger generations facinga seemingly gloomy future. All of this poses serious threatsto the very stability of our countries. This situation cries outfor the international community to redouble its efforts tocombat poverty. United and concerted long-term actionthat mobilizes considerable resources is essential if wewish to achieve satisfactory results.The magnitude of current problems poses a majorchallenge to the international community. The UnitedNations  whose primary mission is to ensure worldsecurity and to promote economic and social progress forpeople  is the ideal forum to discuss these questions andto search for solutions that take everyone’s interests intoaccount. It must be able to play the role that has beenentrusted to it in order to create a global situation ofpeace  which will facilitate development throughcooperation for all peoples. It must respond to thischallenge by using its resources effectively and byadapting itself to changes in international relations.In this regard  the delegation of Haiti welcomes thereform process initiated by Secretary-General Kofi Annanto breathe new life into the Organization and to betterenable it to face the increasingly complex problems oftoday’s world. The initial measures approved by theGeneral Assembly have enabled United Nations bodies towork more coherently and consistently. We hope thatfurther measures to be considered at this session willstrengthen the capacities of the United Nations to carryout its activities.Reform in the Security Council  which has beendiscussed for five years now  is of capital importancegiven the role played by that organ in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Haiti continues to call forgreater openness in the functioning of the Council and forgreater participation in the decision-making process  sothat its decisions reflect the general opinion of theinternational community as a whole and not only theposition of the members of the Council.In this context  the envisaged increase in itsmembership must take into account more systematicallythe principle of equitable geographical distribution. Everyeffort must be made to ensure that the universality of allthe planet’s inhabitants is reflected in the United Nationssystem.In this respect  we welcome the dialogue betweenthe People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. A positiveoutcome to this dialogue will allow for progress in thisarea.This year we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversaryof the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human9Rights. By enshrining the principle of the respect offundamental human rights and by ensuring their promotion the United Nations has made a considerable contribution tothe development of an international system to protect thefundamental freedoms and ensure the emancipation ofpeoples throughout the world.Along these lines  my delegation welcomes the factthat the international community has finally acknowledgedthat the right to development is an intrinsic part offundamental human rights. But that acknowledgment is notsufficient. We must work to ensure full respect for thatright by establishing programmes and by mobilizingsufficient resources.Today human rights are a reality that no Governmentcan ignore. In Haiti respect for human rights is guaranteedin the Constitution  and the Government is committed toensuring the full enjoyment of those rights by all. In thiscontext  reform in the judicial machinery that will allow forthe consolidation of the state of law is now beingimplemented. Regrettably  however  the very complexsituation resulting from a twofold electoral andgovernmental problem has made it difficult for institutionsto function normally and to cooperate with the internationalcommunity. To overcome this handicap  the President ofthe Republic  Mr. René Préval  is resolutely undertakingevery possible effort.Democratic institutions necessarily have a role to play but given the regrettably slow process of democracy-building  the hoped-for results have not yet been achieveddespite the numerous initiatives undertaken. It isencouraging to note  however  that these expectations andinitiatives have been undertaken within the framework ofthe provisions of the Constitution  which guarantees that aviable solution will be found.Similarly  the head of State has consulted all levels ofHaitian society in order to set up a new electoral councilthat will be responsible for organizing  in accordance withthe Constitution and as soon as possible  free  fair anddemocratic elections at the municipal and legislative levels.He will do everything in his power to guarantee theparticipation of all sectors in these elections  which  dulycarried out  will help us overcome the governmental crisisthat has arisen.Despite the unfavourable circumstances that havedarkened the horizon at the dawning of the thirdmillennium  we must not lose hope in a better world. Inorder to do that  we must further develop cooperation strengthen our partnerships and work together to improveour peoples’ standard of living in a world where so manynatural disasters and environmental phenomena remind usof our duty to solidarity. The United Nations is the idealframework for joining our efforts to achieve this commongoal."
"75",3113,"HUN",53,1998,"Allow me to join previous speakers incongratulating Mr. Opertti on his election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. There isno doubt that his experience and wisdom will be veryuseful in effectively guiding our work. I should also like topay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko ofUkraine  for his valuable contribution to the work of thisOrganization and its reform process.After the euphoria following the end of the cold war a period of frustration and disillusionment set in. It hastherefore not always been easy to remain optimistic whileexperiencing everyday realities. Indeed  the profoundchanges that shook the world left it poorly prepared to dealwith old or new challenges.Recently  events that have shaken the world?s securityenvironment and the international economic environmenthave reminded us of the complexities of the post-bipolarperiod by highlighting the multiple and often detrimentaleffects of the inexorable process of globalization that istaking place in all parts of the world. If we are to be in aposition to stem the damaging effects of this process  wemust strengthen multilateralism and expand internationalcooperation so as to be able to resolve the variousproblems  often unprecedented in nature  that facehumankind at the threshold of the twenty-first century.In this undertaking  the United Nations will beneither a world government nor a passive spectator. Itwill continue to be a unique Organization with specialresponsibilities for the maintenance of international peaceand security. It will continue to be a global negotiatingforum whose purpose is to set consensus-based standardsand rules in the most diverse spheres of human activity inorder to help us adapt to the demands of a new age.Today?s world is marked by disquietingdevelopments: bloody conflicts  terrorist acts  organizedcrime  the resurgence of ethnic hatred  attempts tocircumvent or undermine non-proliferation regimes human rights violations causing flows of refugees problems associated with narcotic drugs  a worrisome gapbetween the levels of economic and social developmentof the various parts of the world  environmentaldegradation  population questions and many other issuesand dilemmas that are truly global in nature. Despite thesetbacks that it will probably encounter in the futurefulfilment of its mission  the world Organization willcontinue to be the centre of worldwide mobilization ofefforts to prepare the peoples of the United Nations totackle the challenges that lie before them.In order to ensure the success of this operation  wemust all make serious and sustained efforts to give newimpetus to the United Nations reform process and tomaintain its dynamism. The difficulties encountered alongthe way should not discourage us from the quest toidentify what is possible and feasible  while keeping inmind and striving to achieve what is desirable.From this rostrum  we wish to reaffirm ourcommitment to promoting the revitalization of ourOrganization and the reform of the Security Council. Asfar as expanding the membership of the Council isconcerned  our position has not changed. We continue toadvocate expanding the Council in both categories permanent and non-permanent  and the inclusion ofGermany and Japan  among others  in the category ofpermanent members. On the subject of United Nationsreform  I should like to add that organizational andstructural measures must go hand in hand with efforts toestablish financial stability for the Organization if they areto be effective.Domestically the historic transition that has takenplace in Hungary over the last decade has been a complex20and difficult experience for the country?s population. Afterliving through this arduous period and in the light of thepromising developments in the country  our country todayneeds to be reassured about its future. Our people wish tosee moral and social renewal in the country and to benefitfrom it. Externally  the new Hungarian Governmentcontinues to base its policy on the same principles that itspredecessors followed starting in 1990  when a democraticregime was established in Hungary. It is inspired by thenational interests of the country and the values that it shareswith its partners on both sides of the Atlantic. It intends toremain a factor for stability and security in the CentralEuropean region. Along with its future allies in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and in the EuropeanUnion  it stands ready to contribute to the endeavours of thecommunity of nations to ensure respect for internationalobligations and  where necessary  to take effective measuresto resist actions that are in defiance of its legitimate will.Our efforts  which are aimed at having Hungary jointhe Euro-Atlantic consolidating structures  are motivated byour desire for security and economic prosperity  as well asby the emotional desire to see a historic reunion with therest of Europe after a long  imposed separation. Theseaspirations are fully in keeping with the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations. Not only do they notconflict with them  but they complement and enrich in avery positive way our present activities in the worldOrganization. They will serve to strengthen our specificparticipation in various United Nations activities.Obviously  becoming a member of these consolidatingstructures will not change Hungary?s place on the worldmap. It will not be transported to some other planet. It willremain an integral part of our world  sharing with othernations great and small  rich and poor  the bright as well asthe gloomier aspects of globalization.Problems such as international crime and terrorism  theproliferation of weapons  drug-trafficking and questionsassociated with migration or environmental pollution — allthese phenomena affect my country as they do others  andcall for national  regional and international action. Theymay jeopardize the institutional structures of democracy andparalyse social and economic stability in a particularcountry and beyond its borders. The resurgence that wehave seen in acts of terrorism should also bolster theinternational community?s determination to establishinternational cooperation on the largest possible scale so asto combat this evil by the most efficient means. The centreof these operations should be the United Nations  whichwill give these endeavours coherence and real universality.Hungary attaches great importance to developing andexpanding regional and subregional cooperation with itsneighbours. It has a vital interest in seeing stability anddemocracy flourish among its neighbours. It considers thevarious forms of regional and subregional cooperation tobe invaluable and indispensable tools for achieving theseobjectives. It is ready to participate actively in this regard.It should be noted that one of the driving forces forthe implementation by the countries of the region ofpositive measures for socio-economic progress is preciselytheir shared wish to join the structures of Euro-Atlanticintegration. Hungary has often spoken out in favour ofthese aspirations and will continue to support them.In this regard  we feel that respect for the rule oflaw and institutional guarantees of the full enjoyment ofhuman rights  including those of national minorities  arenot simply key prerequisites to membership of theseintegration structures. They are also an indispensable andvital factor for the establishment of social peace withincountries themselves.In speaking of the eastern part of our continent  Iwould emphasize that  on the one hand  it is impossibleto transform the region  with its turbulent history of age-old coexistence between various ethnic communities  intoa zone of tranquillity and prosperity  and inconceivable toconsider healing the deep wounds inflicted by aggressivenationalism without taking into account the legitimateaspirations of national minorities and their desire toremain intact as communities and keepers of a specificnational heritage  in accordance with the standardsadopted by the competent international organizations andthe practice of the democratic States. On the other hand we resolutely oppose the policy of “ethnic cleansing” forced separation and the creation of new kinds of ethnicor religious segregation in Europe at the dawn of a newcentury.Hungary is deeply concerned by the deterioratingsituation in Kosovo. It shares the view that  without adetermined international commitment  this conflict islikely to spread  with unfathomable consequences for theregion and Europe as a whole. We therefore support theefforts aimed at stopping this conflict as quickly aspossible by peaceful and political means. We believe thatSecurity Council resolution 1199 (1998) can serve to pavethe way for this. Hungary hopes that substantivenegotiations between the parties can begin without delayand that they will lead to a lasting settlement grantingbroad autonomy to Kosovo while preserving the territorial21integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In thisrespect  Hungary stresses the primary responsibility borneby the Yugoslav authorities in the quest for peace and ademocratic solution.The Balkans have suffered too much for theinternational community to permit an escalation of violence a return to terror and impunity for human rights violations.My country is prepared  to the extent of its abilities  tocontribute to the international community?s action to restorelong-term stability and the rule of law in the region.We have also followed with special attention thedevelopments in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our primaryobjective is the full implementation of the DaytonAgreement. However  we must accept the fact that following years of bloodshed  savagery and intolerance  theprocess envisaged in the Agreement could be moreprecarious and protracted than we believed and that theethnocentric and exclusionary attitudes there may prove tobe more entrenched than we had thought. Having said this we are participating actively in the international effort toassist that country in getting back on its feet and to ensurethat the terrible years of aggression and horrendous warnever return.This year  we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Although thecommemoration of the birth of that fundamental documentis a fine occasion for festivities  it is also important thatnew measures be taken to implement the universalstandards embodied in the Declaration so that the UnitedNations may  in all places and at all times  not only offera ray of hope  but be an effective instrument in the serviceestablishment of United Nations machinery for theinternational protection of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms is one of the international community?s greatachievements  emanating directly from the UniversalDeclaration. In this context  we welcome the existence ofthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights and the establishment  after much hard work of the International Criminal Court.Grave and large-scale human rights abuses continue tobe committed throughout the world. We have witnessedassaults on the freedom of individuals and communities and crude and more subtle discriminatory practices including those based on national or religious origin. Thisprompts us to ask the fundamental question as to whetherthe international community did all it needed to do in goodtime to prevent these events and used all the meansavailable to it. I am afraid that the answer to thesequestions is “no”.Linking peace to justice and reconciling politicalexpediency and moral considerations have always beenextremely difficult challenges. Nevertheless  if peace is tolast and take firm root  it must be sustained and bolsteredby democracy  the rule of law and a responsible andtransparent system of government. That is why wesupport the introduction of the human rights dimensioninto all United Nations spheres of activity  includingpeacekeeping operations. That is why we insist that thoseaccused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in thevarious conflicts  from the Great Lakes to the formerYugoslavia  must be brought to justice. The measurestaken in this regard deserve the support of all theMembers of our Organization.We cannot allow our attention to be distracted fromthe grave ongoing situations in many regions of ourworld  where political upheaval  financial crisis andnatural disaster render human existence extremelyprecarious and arduous. The United Nations cannot turnits back on these pressing problems. We welcome theattention rightly accorded to Africa by the Organizationand to the search for solutions to its difficulties. Ourworld is shrinking every day. Therefore  a heightenedawareness of worldwide concerns and human solidarity isvital. For what is at stake today is the future of ourcivilization and the quality of life of future generations onEarth. We must not miss the opportunity offered by theend of the century to decide how to improve the lot of thehuman race. The United Nations is the best place totackle  without delay  the crucial questions facingmankind."
"76",3160,"IDN",53,1998,"It gives me great pleasure Sir  to extend to you my congratulations and those of theIndonesian delegation on your election to the presidencyof the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. Ishould like to assure you of our full cooperation in thedischarge of your duties.To your distinguished predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Hennadiy Udovenko  I wish to convey ourfelicitations for having so ably guided the fifty-secondsession to a successful conclusion.Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute tothe Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his dedication to the reform and restructuring of theOrganization  as well as for his determined efforts to seeka peaceful solution to conflict situations in various partsof the world.One of the great ironies of our time is that at the endof a century in which the amazing advances of scienceand technology could have been harnessed to effectivelyaddress the problem of poverty  scores of millions morepeople have slipped below the poverty line. At the sametime  there has been a massive application of science andtechnology to increase humankindâs capacity to deal outdeath and destruction. Even in the best of times humankindâs use of economic resources has not beenmarked by any deep sense of responsibility but rather by22mindless consumption that has often led to the degradationof our environment. Unfortunately squandering resources isan old habit of the human race.Today  I fear that the awesome force of globalization itself propelled by science and technology  is also beingsquandered: instead of serving to unify humankind in adecisive assault against the persistent systemic problems ofour time  it is being used to press the advantage of thestrong over the weak  thereby widening the gap between thedeveloped and developing world.Herein lies the tragedy of the human race: that ourvast capacity to alter the planet on which we live has beenmatched to a parochial vision. Large and complex actionsare motivated by narrow self-interest. And in thenarrowness of our perspective we inflict great harm on oneanother. That is why the imbalances and inequities ininternational relations persist: we can never get rid of themuntil we attain that essential balance within ourselves between the scope of our actions and that of our intentions.Yet I do not despair. Against the backdrop of acentury of conflict  one human achievement shines: thefounding of the United Nations. It is admittedly a flawedachievement  for after five decades it has not yet brought usthe global peace that we envisaged to be its greatestpromise. But it has spared us from the horrors of anotherworld war and possibly from a nuclear holocaust. That thisflawed jewel of human reason should remain to serve us ina more effective way in the next century is an imperative.Through its instrumentality  it is still possible for us to tamethe dogs of war and to exorcise the spectre of poverty.Through its processes of consultation and debate  we canstill attain a broadness of mind that matches the globalsweep of our actions. Through the habits of cooperation andtrust that it engenders among its Members and among thecountless individuals and institutions that participate in itsdialogues  we might yet realize our shared vision of aglobal civil society. But first it must be reformed  furtherdemocratized and fully empowered.The United Nations  as the central mechanism andcatalyst for multilateral cooperation  must be enabled toplay its mandated role in the achievement and maintenanceof peace  security and development. It is therefore of thegreatest importance that it be provided with the resourceswith which to carry on its work instead of being strappedfor funds as it is now. The legal obligation of everyMember State in that regard must therefore be strictly met.It is also essential that the ongoing process of reformof the United Nations be intensified  particularly withregard to the Security Council  taking into account thedesire of all States from all regions to participate in itswork  as well as present political  economic anddemographic realities. For indeed  developing countriesare grossly under-represented on the Council especially ata time when its work is focused on conflict situations inthe developing world. This anomaly has to be redressedby an increase in the representation of the developingworld in the permanent as well as in the non-permanentmembership of the Council. The legitimacy  credibilityand effectiveness of the Councilâs work depend on itsrepresentative character. Indonesia views the task ofSecurity Council reform as a matter of urgency  but wemust not be rushed into any hasty or ill-advised decisionsthat would be detrimental to the long-term interests ofMember States. In this context  there is a need to continueand accelerate the work of the Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation onand Increase in the Membership of the Security Counciland Other Matters Related to the Security Council.If the cause of disarmament  particularly nucleardisarmament  has not made substantive progress in recentyears  it is largely because there are States that believethey have much to gain by their exclusive possession ofnuclear arms. The unjustifiable privileges conferred on thenuclear-weapon States have given rise to a regime ofdiscrimination and hypocrisy as well as a situation wherenon-nuclear countries wishing to enjoy the sameprivileges seek to become nuclear States themselves.Thus  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) has not fully met its objectives  and theimbalances and discrimination inherent to it havepersisted. Regrettably  too  the second PreparatoryCommittee for the 2000 Review Conference failed toagree on substantive issues. Still  we must persevere andprepare ourselves for the next NPT Review Conferenceand focus on the inequities and imbalances inherent in theTreaty. At the same time  we urge the nuclear-weaponStates to implement faithfully both the letter and spirit ofagreements relating to non-proliferation and nucleardisarmament. We call on all States to refrain fromdeveloping these weapons so that we may the soonerattain our ultimate objective of their total elimination.The slow pace of progress towards non-proliferationand nuclear disarmament compels us to work even harderto achieve global disarmament objectives. The conveningof the fourth special session of the General Assemblydevoted to disarmament is essential for providing new23political momentum that would enable and encourage theGovernments and peoples of the world to move towardsdisarmament  including the elimination of nuclear weapons.It is therefore imperative that we take further concrete stepsleading to the convening of the fourth special session.While disarmament marks time  discord is rampant inthe form of armed conflicts  disputes and tensions betweenand within States in many parts of the globe. The situationin Bosnia and Herzegovina remains a source of continuingconcern for Indonesia. Hence  we reaffirm our steadfastsupport for the full  impartial and effective implementationof the Dayton Peace Agreement. In Afghanistan  we call onthe warring factions to cease hostilities and to startconstructive dialogue. The protracted civil strife in thatcountry also threatens to spill over beyond its borders. Weurge the parties concerned to cooperate with the UnitedNations in its concerted endeavours to restore peace andstability in the region. The dire situation in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo calls for continued and concertedefforts in restoring peace and tranquillity.Indonesia is appalled by the terrorist bomb attacks onthe American embassies in the capitals of Kenya andTanzania that caused the death of nearly 200 people and thewounding of thousands. We reiterate our condemnation ofall acts and forms of terrorism wherever they may occurand whoever perpetrates them. At the same time  we stressthat we will never condone the resort to unilateral acts ofaggression and violation of the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of States as a means to combat terrorism. Wetherefore urge all States to enhance internationalcooperation in the fight against terrorism while strictlyobserving and implementing the relevant internationalinstruments.My delegation welcomes the recent positivedevelopments concerning the Lockerbie incident thatculminated in the adoption of Security Council resolution1192 (1998). It is our hope that discussions will now takeplace between the United Kingdom  the United States andthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  including on the appropriatetrial arrangements. Early implementation of this resolutionwill hopefully lead to a definitive settlement of this issueand the lifting of sanctions imposed on Libya.In the Middle East  the situation in the occupiedterritories keeps deteriorating as the peace process remainsin the grip of a stalemate. Israeli policies and practices ofoppression and provocation have continued unabated. In ablatant attempt to change the demography of the occupiedterritories  Israel keeps building new settlements andexpanding existing ones. More ominously  it hasarbitrarily extended the administrative powers of theoccupying authorities in Jerusalem beyond the cityâsborders in a bid to consolidate Israelâs hold on EastJerusalem and the West Bank and thereby entrenchJerusalem as its capital. This would pre-empt negotiationson the status of the Holy City and threaten to unravel thepeace process  with grave repercussions not only for theMiddle East but also beyond.Peace and stability will continue to elude the regionuntil Israel complies with its treaty obligations andunconditionally withdraws from all occupied Arabterritories in accordance with all relevant United Nationsresolutions  in particular 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425(1978). The peace process must be resumed andagreements reached must be implemented in their entiretyand not selectively or conditionally.In South-East Asia  the elections held recently inCambodia  deemed to have been generally free and fairby international observers  should now lead to therestoration of normalcy in the country. It is time that allthe parties in Cambodia resolve their differences in thespirit of national reconciliation and unity in the largerinterest of their country  work together toward theformation of a new government and thereby contribute topeace and stability in South-East Asia.The world economy is teetering on the brink ofrecession  if not already experiencing one. Economicoutput has slowed for the developed and developingcountries alike  and growth in world trade has alsodecelerated. While official forecasts indicate a slowdownin the growth of world output to 2.5 per cent  any suchforecasts may still be too optimistic. Only a little morethan a year ago  the world economy was on a significantgrowth path  and the outlook was generally bright. InAsia  robust growth for decades had transformed much ofthe region into an economic powerhouse. Today  many ofthose dynamic economies are crippled. One third of theworld is grappling with serious economic slowdown andthe frightening possibility of a depression.In the affected countries  including Indonesia economic turmoil has reached a devastating level  pushingtheir economies into recession and their people to thevery edge of their endurance. Unemployment has soared and an unacceptable number of people have slipped underthe poverty line. Education has been severely affected and food is in short supply. The experience of South-EastAsian countries in this financial turmoil has shown that24even the most dynamic economies are vulnerable. In spiteof the judicious macroeconomic policies that they adoptedand the often painful structural adjustments that they carriedout  the development gains they earned over the decadescrumbled in the span of a few weeks. The lesson of thisdebacle is that the market is driven by sentiments as muchas fundamentals  by perception rather than facts alone.These adverse aspects of globalization havefurthermore greatly eroded multilateral cooperation fordevelopment. The concept of development as a special partof a multilateral support system has been largely replacedby the laissez-faire approach to the globalized economy.This has resulted  inter alia  in sharply contracted financialresources for development for the majority of thedeveloping countries  particularly the least developedcountries. External indebtedness has escalated  andprotectionism in international trade has risen significantlyas more and more countries have become inward-looking inthis era of globalization.This dire situation will certainly impact on theimplementation of the commitments agreed upon at therecent major global conferences  including in the fields ofenvironment and development  social development population and development  women and development habitat and food. It is therefore a matter of great concern toall of us that the achievement of sustainable humandevelopment will be further removed from reality.I believe that our troubles are less the result of thevagaries of globalization than the consequence of aneconomic doctrine that has dominated internationaleconomic relations for many years now. This doctrinepresents unbridled liberalization as a panacea for alleconomies  developed and developing. In their desire tointegrate themselves with the global economy  manydeveloping countries have audaciously opened up theireconomies  only to realize that the social and political costsof doing so often outstrip the benefits. Moreover  theinordinate emphasis on unfettered markets has led to theneglect of such development issues as internationalcooperation for development  the need for non-commercialfinancial flows and the necessity of differential treatmentfor developing countries. Thus  the international agenda hasbeen governed by the interests of the developed countriesin opening up opportunities for foreign investments  privatecapital flows â€” that often turn out to be merelyspeculative â€” and the export of their manufactures.In the face of such stark global realities  we mustintensify international solidarity and cooperation. Theinternational community should strengthen itsmanagement role in the world economy  in particular inthe monetary and financial fields  including theestablishment of surveillance and regulatory frameworksfor short-term capital flows and trade in currencies without constraining the liberalization of economies. Thisstrengthened international management role is essential ifwe seek to avert future crises  alleviate the adverse impactof globalization and maximize its benefits.We should therefore seriously consider variousinitiatives for enhancing global financial and monetarycooperation. The proposed United Nations conference onfinancing for development would provide an opportunityto explore various options towards financial stability anddevelopment. It is also encouraging that the two-day high-level dialogue of the General Assembly last weekcontributed to increased awareness and understanding ofthe economic and social impact of globalization and theneed for international cooperation in addressing that issue.Another important proposal is the one made by theNon-Aligned Movement for an international conferenceon money and finance for development in order to pursuecomprehensive reform of the existing internationalmonetary and financial system.Because we want the North-South dialogue toproceed in earnest  we should broaden and intensifySouth-South cooperation. Decades of development effortshave greatly increased the economic complementaritiesamong developing countries. We must tap thesecomplementarities and strengthen partnership in the South.In this effort  our developed-country partners andinternational institutions can play a valuable role byparticipating in tripartite arrangements. In this regard  anumber of steps to promote South-South cooperation havebeen initiated  including a high-level meeting on regionaland subregional cooperation  which will be held in Bali Indonesia  this coming December. The commemoration ofthe twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the BuenosAires Plan of Action on South-South cooperation will beheld at a special one-day meeting in the GeneralAssembly. Of great importance is the Group of 77initiative on a South summit to be held prior to theMillennium Assembly  in the year 2000.This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  which wasproclaimed as a common standard of achievement for allpeoples and all nations. To us in Indonesia who are nowin the midst of formulating and initiating far-reaching25economic  social and political reforms  this is a particularlysignificant occasion. In fact  in line with our commitmentto the Vienna Declaration  we have just launched a NationalPlan of Action on Human Rights aimed at infusing thevarious segments of society and of the Government including the national security apparatus  with valuesconducive to the promotion and protection of human rights.We expect to sign and ratify in the near future several moreUnited Nations conventions on human rights.The reform-development Government that is now inplace in Indonesia will carry out vigorous measures tofurther democratize our national life. For we know verywell that our economic recovery will basically have to bedriven by confidence  on the part of the internationalcommunity as well as on the part of our own citizens  inour own system of governance.In the face of the challenges of our time  we inIndonesia will rebuild and refine the institutions that willmake the laws of economics work for our society. At theinternational level  I believe that it is also necessary tobuild and refine the institutions that will make globaleconomics work for all nations  whether developed ordeveloping.Globalization is not the demon that has been menacingour prospects for the future. But for too long we haveaccepted doctrines formulated and waved in the name ofliberalization. The most perceptive economists of our dayhave been pointing out that error  and we must now heedthem. Globalization and liberalization never required us tomerely compete in dancing to the tune of the market place.It never told us to stop cooperating with one another. Butmany of us were enchanted with the gospel of unfetteredlaissez-faire until it was seen that the contagion of afinancial crisis in one developing country in one corner ofthe globe could plunge the entire world into depression.Now it is clear â€” if it was not sufficiently clearbefore â€” that we are stewards of one anotherâs welfare that we must extend a hand to every brother and sister whofalters  or in the course of globalization none of us developed or developing  will see salvation. Human destinyis indivisible. Let us never forget that again."
"77",3207,"IND",53,1998,"I congratulate you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of the General Assemblyat its fifty-third session. We wish you well in our sharedendeavours in the United Nations and offer you our fullcooperation. We would like to thank your predecessor forhis commitment and contribution  and to commend himfor his work throughout the last year.I first addressed the Assembly as Foreign Ministerin 1977. Since then I have for many years had theprivilege to attend General Assembly sessions  butwithout ministerial responsibility. I acknowledge withgratitude the confidence of successive Prime Ministers.To me  this also signifies the consensus on the nationalinterests and the foreign policy of India. When Iaddressed the General Assembly in 1977  it was in manyways a turning point in the history of India. The JanataGovernment was a coalition of many factions  whichunited in the restoration of our people?s faith indemocracy. Since then we have had many changes ofGovernment  but the people?s political awareness andtheir faith in the institutions which uphold ourconstitutional system has been unwavering. Today  whenI come to this rostrum as Prime Minister  I come onbehalf of another coalition. India has demonstrated thatdemocracy can take root in a developing country. I amconfident that the Indian experience will prove thatdemocracy can also provide the basis for stable  long-termeconomic growth in developing societies. That is the paththat the people of India have chosen  and I stand beforethe Assembly today as the symbol of this new resurgentIndia.16The world of the 1970s has receded into history. Theshackling constraints of the cold war are gone. Thedistinguishing feature of the last two decades has been thespread of democracy worldwide. By force of example  wehave been one of the authors of the triumph of democracy.From this flows our desire to see the democratization of theUnited Nations itself. An international body that does notreflect  and change with  changing international realitieswill inevitably face a credibility deficit. We thereforesupport a revitalized and more effective United Nations one that is more responsive to the concerns of the vastmajority of its Member States and is better equipped tomeet the challenges that are ahead of us in the twenty-firstcentury.The Security Council does not represent contemporaryreality; it does not represent democracy in internationalrelations. Following the end of the cold war  it acquired thefreedom to act  but experience shows that the Council hasacted only when it was convenient for its permanentmembers. The experience of Somalia does not do credit tothe Security Council — and there are other examples too.Peacekeeping operations cannot be a reflection of ulteriorpolitical priorities and perceptions.There is only one cure: to bring in new blood. TheSecurity Council must be made representative of themembership of the United Nations. Developing countriesmust be made permanent members. This is a right to whichthe developing world is entitled. The presence of somedeveloping countries as permanent members is inescapableif the responsibilities of the Security Council are to beeffectively discharged  particularly when we see that theCouncil acts almost exclusively in the developing world. Itis only natural that on decisions affecting the developingworld  these countries should have a say  on equal terms.Along with other measures  the Security Council too mustbe reformed  expanding its non-permanent membership sothat more developing countries can serve on it. But thatalone is not enough  because as long as effective power inthe Council rests with the permanent membership  theinterests of the developing world will not be promoted orprotected unless developing countries are made permanentmembers on a par with the present permanent members.Only this will make the Council an effective instrument forthe international community in dealing with current andfuture challenges.The new permanent members must of course havethe ability to discharge the responsibilities that come withpermanent membership. India believes it has that ability and  as we have said before from this rostrum  we areprepared to accept the responsibilities of permanentmembership  and believe we are qualified for it.It will be a great day when democracy becomes theuniversal norm  and when the United Nations reflects thatdemocracy in its institutions and functioning. However open democratic societies have one scourge to contendwith: terrorism. The challenge before countries like mineand other democracies is to maintain our openness safeguard individual rights  and at the same time give noquarter to terrorists. Several speakers before me haverecounted the terrible toll that terrorists have exactedworldwide  taking advantage of the trust that characterizesopen societies. I recall that the Group of Seven summitalmost two decades back identified terrorism as one of themost serious threats to civilized societies. Events sincethen  including the blowing up of the Air India Kanishkaaircraft and the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie  and therecent bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam  have onlyestablished the correctness of that judgement.Terrorism is one threat that affects us all equally.Terrorism takes a daily toll around the world. It is themost vicious among international crimes  and the mostpervasive  pernicious and ruthless threat to the lives ofmen and women in open societies  and to internationalpeace and security. In India  we have had to cope withterrorism aided and abetted by a neighbouring country fornearly two decades. We have borne this with patience  butnone should doubt the strength of our resolve to crushthis challenge. Its tentacles have spread around the world.Today  it has links with illicit trade in drugs and arms andwith money-laundering. In short  terrorism has goneglobal and it can only be defeated by organizedinternational action.Let us make up our minds once and for all: terrorismis a crime against humanity. Unilateral steps can hardlystand scrutiny in an open society  let alone in the eyes ofthe international community. It should be the primary taskof all open and pluralist societies to develop collectivemeans for tackling this menace. At its summit meeting inDurban  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries calledfor an international conference in 1999 to develop such acollective response. We earnestly recommend that the1999 conference launch the process of negotiations on aninternational convention to provide for collective action17against States and organizations which initiate or aid andabet terrorism.Now  at the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  there is a growing realizationthat economic  social  cultural  civil and political rightsform a seamless web. Analyses carried out in recent yearsby the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees amply reflect the vicious cycle of how violationsof economic  social and cultural rights inevitably lead toviolations of civil and political rights. In defining its index the Human Development Report gives a higher weightingto economic criteria for developing countries; this weightingis reduced for developed countries  highlighting theimportance of the right to development for developingsocieties. It is therefore a matter of concern that theabsolutism that some are seeking to advocate in thepromotion of human rights is often at the cost of the rightto development.India has ratified both the International Covenant onEconomic  Social and Cultural Rights and the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights. Other institutions inour country — the National Human Rights Commission  afree media and an independent judiciary — all serve toensure that the rights set out in international human rightsstatutes are enjoyed by all citizens. We also remainconvinced that unless progress is made on economic  socialand cultural rights  including the right to development  theworld will continue to witness international conflict leadingto migrations  displacement of people and human rightsabuses.In the closing years of the twentieth century  thechallenge of nuclear disarmament is another of the prioritiesfacing the international community. We have successfullyprohibited chemical and biological weapons in recentdecades. The present century has witnessed thedevelopment and the tragic use of nuclear weapons. Wemust ensure that the legacy of this weapon of massdestruction is not carried into the next century.For the last half-century  India has consistentlypursued the objectives of international peace  along withequal and legitimate security for all through globaldisarmament. These concepts are among the basic tenets ofour national security. India has  over the years  sought toenhance its national security by promoting global nucleardisarmament  convinced that a world free of nuclearweapons would enhance both global security and India?snational security.The negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) began in 1993 with a mandate thatsuch a treaty would contribute effectively to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in all aspects  to theprocess of nuclear disarmament and  therefore  to theenhancement of international peace and security. Indiaparticipated actively and constructively in thenegotiations  and sought to place the Treaty in adisarmament framework by proposing its linkage with atime-bound programme for the universal elimination of allnuclear weapons.It is a matter of history that India?s proposals werenot accepted. The Treaty  as it emerged  was not acceptedby India on grounds of national security. We madeexplicit our objection that  despite our stand having beenmade clear  the Treaty text made India?s signature andratification a precondition for its entry into force. Mindfulof its deteriorating security environment  which obliged usto stand apart from the CTBT in 1996  India undertook alimited series of five underground tests  conducted on 11and 13 May 1998. These tests were essential for ensuringa credible nuclear deterrent for India?s national security inthe foreseeable future.These tests do not signal a dilution of India?scommitment to the pursuit of global nuclear disarmament.Accordingly  after concluding this limited testingprogramme  India announced a voluntary moratorium onfurther underground nuclear test explosions. We conveyedour willingness to move towards a de jure formalizationof that obligation. In announcing a moratorium  India hasalready accepted the basic obligation of the CTBT. In1996  India could not have accepted the obligation  assuch a restraint would have eroded our capability andcompromised our national security.India  having harmonized its national imperativesand security obligations and desirous of continuing tocooperate with the international community  is nowengaged in discussions with key interlocutors on a rangeof issues  including the CTBT. We are prepared to bringthese discussions to a successful conclusion  so that theentry into force of the CTBT is not delayed beyondSeptember 1999. We expect that other countries  asindicated in article XIV of the Treaty  will adhere to itwithout conditions.After protracted discussions  the Conference onDisarmament in Geneva is now in a position to beginnegotiations on a treaty that will prohibit the productionof fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear18explosive devices. Once again  we are conscious that this isa partial step. Such a treaty  as and when it is concludedand enters into force  will not eliminate existing nucleararsenals. Yet we will participate in these negotiations ingood faith in order to ensure a treaty that is non-discriminatory and meets India?s security imperatives. Indiawill pay serious attention to any other multilateralinitiativesin this area during the course of the negotiations in theConference on Disarmament.As a responsible State committed to non-proliferation India has undertaken that it shall not transfer these weaponsor related know-how to other countries. We have aneffective system of export controls and shall make it morestringent where necessary  including by expanding controllists of equipment and technology to make them morecontemporary and effective in the context of a nuclearIndia. At the same time  as a developing country  we areconscious that nuclear technology has a number of peacefulapplications  and we shall continue to cooperate activelywith other countries in this regard  in keeping with ourinternational responsibilities.A few weeks ago  at the Non-Aligned Summit inDurban  India proposed  and the Movement agreed  that aninternational conference be held  preferably in 1999  withthe objective of arriving at an agreement before the end ofthis millennium on a phased programme for the completeelimination of all nuclear weapons. I call upon all membersof the international community  and particularly the othernuclear-weapon States  to join in this endeavour. Let uspledge that when we assemble here in the new millenniumit will be to welcome the commitment that mankind shallnever again be subjected to the use or threat of use ofnuclear weapons.The decade of the 1990s has fallen far short ofexpectations. Nowhere is this more apparent than on theglobal economic scene. The sense of triumphalism thatheralded the wave of global capitalism is now giving wayto caution and realism. What was initially seen as an Asianflu is now spreading to other continents.The hypothesis that unfettered capital flows wouldfoster economic development  with the global financialmarkets adjusting the exchange rates  stands falsified. Whatwe have seen is the growth of a large volume of “virtualmoney” that has not been generated by productiveeconomic activity. But the power of the “virtual money” isreal  evident in the fact that national regulatory mechanismsare unable to cope with the impact of its rapid movementin and out of currencies. Its volatility in the short runfollows not economic logic but rumour and sentiment with results that are self-reinforcing. In developingcountries and in western financial capitals  there is nowa growing acceptance that premature liberalization ofcapital markets has been a primary cause of the currentcrisis.Does it mean that the world should turn back fromglobalization? Our answer is an emphatic “No”. Risingeconomic interdependence is a phenomenon driven by thetechnological imperative  but we must learn how tomanage the change. India has not been affected asseverely as some other countries  largely because weadopted policies that were more prudent. But a drop incommodity prices by 30 per cent in a year and areduction in net capital flows to the emerging markets by50 per cent will have a negative impact on growtheverywhere  including in the developed world.I must emphasize that democratically electedleadership in an open developing society such as Indiaalso faces another challenge. We cannot let an unbridledfree market system aggravate existing economic andsocial disparities. In fact  we need policy instruments toreduce disparities  thus creating a more stableenvironment in the long term. Such policies are necessaryin accountable democracies and are in no wayinconsistent with managed liberalization.It is high time that we begin a new internationaldialogue on the future of a global and interdependenteconomy. This is a task for the sovereign Statesrepresented here and cannot be left solely to the dynamicsof an unregulated market place.I think I speak for all of us when I say that we areon the threshold of a new age. This is an overused phrase but we are all aware that an exciting new universe iswithin our reach. Several centuries ago  Isaac Newtondescribed his scientific discoveries as pebbles on thebeach  while the ocean of truth lay undiscovered. It wasmodest of that great scientist to so describe his work  butI believe that we are now actually sailingin the ocean of truth. We have made exciting discoveriesand will make many more which will move humankindforward.And yet there is also an uneasy feeling that all is notwell. The world is not at ease with itself. In almost allparts of the world forces are bubbling under the surfacetranquillity that threaten the gains of the last century and19seek to lead the world towards bigotry  violence andunhealthy exclusivism.India has a message — not a new one  for almost allreligions have expressed the thought before. But we havepreserved the tenets of freedom  equality and tolerance inour daily lives. If the world of the twenty-first century is tobe a better place than the world we have seen so far  thesevalues must prevail. History also shows that these are easierto prescribe than to observe. And yet  as we move towardsever closer interdependence  there is no alternative. Theworld and its leaders must summon the will to rise to theoccasion and enter the new age with a new outlook. This isthe task before us  and I declare India?s readiness to makeits full contribution in the testing times ahead.I close with an ancient “sloka” from the Rig Ved ascomposed thousands of years ago in Sanskrit  the oldestlanguage in the world:“Svastir manushebhyahaOordhvam Jugatu beshajamSam no astu dvipatheSam ChathusthpateOm Shanti  Shanti  Shanti”This means: Let all human beings be blessed withprosperity. Let all flora and fauna which are life line of allcreatures grow abundantly. Let there be harmony with alltwo-legged creations. Let there be harmony with all four-legged creations. Let there be peace  peace  peace."
"78",3253,"IRL",53,1998,"Let me at the very outsetextend to Mr. Opertti our warm congratulations upon hiselection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. We are particularly pleased to see presidingthe Foreign Minister of Uruguay  a country with whichIreland has always enjoyed the friendliest of relations. Hisrich experience in politics  education  diplomacy and thelaw will serve the Assembly well as he directs its work forthe coming year.Also on behalf of the Irish people  I wish to pay aparticular tribute to the Secretary-General for the thoughtfuland determined leadership which he has brought from theAfrican continent to the discharge of his most challengingoffice.Commitment to the work of this Organization is acentral part of Ireland?s foreign policy and of her place inthe world. Irish people strongly support that commitment.We feel close bonds with the United Nations. With manylike-minded countries  we have striven to uphold anddevelop the universal role of the Organization for thepromotion of peace  development  international cooperationand human rights. These purposes are linked in the Charterand they are linked in reality.All around us  side by side with rapid technologicaland material development  we see in every region of theworld uncertainty  insecurity and conflict.Our attention has been gripped this year by the severeeconomic and financial difficulties which are besettingdeveloped and emerging markets as well as economies intransition. The full effects of these difficulties have yet toplay themselves out. We are all affected.More than 1 billion people struggle to survive on lessthan a dollar a day. Environmental degradation and naturaldisasters wreak unnecessary havoc on entire nations.Meanwhile  obscenely disproportionate levels of resourcesare diverted to fuel the arms trade and supply theunjustifiably large arsenals in parts of the world that canleast afford it. Human rights remain to be fully respected inall regions.I think that these realities are among the root causesof the conflicts confronting us today. If the new millenniumis to open with real prospects of alleviating such conflictsituations  it is the root causes which we must togethertackle; prevention is always better  and certainly less costly than cure.As my Swedish colleague has said  the AustrianPresidency has spoken and addressed the Assembly onbehalf of the 15 Member States of the European Union expressing our position on many issues. Nevertheless  Iwill focus my remarks on a number of issues which areof particular importance to the country which I represent.We should all acknowledge that there can be no realpeace or security without development. Development isabout dignity and offering impoverished people aroundthe world the chance of a better life now and betterprospects for their children. This is not too much to ask.Its achievement  however  requires a new partnership ofinternational engagement and commitment. All of us mustshare a determination to break down the walls ofexclusion and marginalization that divide our world.A new partnership must address not only aid flowsbut also the crippling problem of debt. It must assistdeveloping countries to participate on a fair basis in theworld economy. Development cooperation is not onlyabout reducing unacceptable levels of poverty. Allcountries  developed and developing alike  must togetheraddress shared priorities that affect all our countries andall our peoples. An integrated approach is called for  asprevious speakers have mentioned.In this context  I welcome in particular the seminalreport of the Secretary-General — I have alreadywelcomed it in a committee today — on the causes ofconflict and sustainable development in Africa. We willwork actively with other Member States to ensure thatthis report receives the strongly positive response itdeserves.I will allude for a moment to Ireland?s developmentcooperation programme  if I may. As for Ireland?scontribution  it is with some pride that I can say that wehave one of the fastest growing development cooperationprogrammes in the world today. The Irish Government iscommitted to reaching the United Nations target forofficial development assistance — that is  0.7 per cent ofgross national product — and I think it?s fair to say thatwe are fully determined to make further progress towardsthis goal in the coming years.Last week  my Government agreed on a package ofdebt alleviation measures for developing countries  in themultilateral and bilateral fields  amounting to some $46million  which is a considerable sum of money for acountry the size of Ireland  and I think it was a measure36of the bona fides of our intention in this whole area ofdevelopment cooperation.For Ireland  support for development cooperationmeans  by definition  support for the United Nations in thisvital area. The United Nations has only the resources whichthe Member States give it. These must reflect our politicalcommitment to confront challenges. I think that is whydeclining contributions to core resources for United Nationsfunds  programmes and agencies are a matter of deep andgrave concern.For its part  Ireland has increased significantly thelevel of its commitment. I am pleased to say that ourDevelopment Assistance Programme now supports 32funds  programmes and agencies of the United Nationssystem  compared to 13 just five years ago. I pledge beforethis Assembly the continuation of Ireland?s support in thatregard.Again  the question of disarmament and nucleardisarmament was raised by my Swedish colleague  theprevious speaker. The end of the cold war provided theinternational community with a unique opportunity toaccomplish the final elimination of nuclear weapons and tousher in a nuclear-free world. Yet  while the past 10 yearshave witnessed important steps to reduce nuclear arsenals there has been no clear commitment on the part of nuclear-weapon States to proceed rapidly to nuclear disarmament as required by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT).Ireland?s advocacy of nuclear disarmament has beenconsistent and unrelenting. We have been the strongestprotagonists of the achievement of the goals of the nuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty  which Ireland proposed in 1958and was the author of at that time. We must begin to takecertain fundamental steps now to achieve the NPT?s non-discriminatory and universal application. We cannot enterthe third millennium with the prospect that nuclear weaponswill be considered legitimate for the indefinite future.That is why Ireland has  this year  joined with sevenlike-minded States — Brazil  Egypt  Mexico  New Zealand Slovenia  South Africa and Sweden — to launch thedeclaration “Towards a Nuclear-Weapons-Free World: TheNeed for A New Agenda”. The steps called for in the NewAgenda are premised on a clear and unambiguouscommitment to be undertaken by the five nuclear-weaponStates to engage in nuclear disarmament negotiations withinan entirely new context. They are also premised on asimilar commitment by the three nuclear-weapon-capableStates — India  Pakistan and  of course  Israel — notparties to the NPT.This session of the General Assembly provides aunique opportunity to give substance to proposals such asthose contained in the Joint Ministerial Declaration of 9June. My colleagues and I have therefore prepared a draftresolution which sets out an agenda for the definitiveelimination of nuclear weapons for all time and which weask the Assembly to consider and adopt in the FirstCommittee.On the question of landmines  coincidentally andfortuitously  last week I presided over a landmineconference in Dublin while the International Campaign toBan Landmines was meeting in my own capital city todevelop a civil-society-based landmine monitor. Wereceived the welcome news that the fortieth ratification ofthe landmines Convention had just taken place. We nowhave a total ban in place and can set our minds toeradicating these obscene instruments and theirconsequences.The inexcusable delay in addressing the question oflandmines was a glaring failure of the internationalcommunity to look squarely at an issue of human securitywhich was fundamental to development. Another exampleis the persistence of expenditure on arms in certaincountries  which is out of all proportion to socialspending. This state of affairs must cease and the armstrade that feeds it must be curtailed. I would personallylike to see it stopped and put out of existence.On the question of human rights  a further and verypervasive root cause of instability and conflict isinadequate respect of the very rights of which I amspeaking. There are too many specific instances of humanrights abuse in every region of the world. There arehopeful signs — for example  in Nigeria and EastTimor — but elsewhere the situation remains bleak.In this  the fiftieth anniversary year of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  we must reaffirm ourcollective commitment to promoting respect for theserights and freedoms by progressive measures  national andinternational  to secure their universal recognition andobservance. The Universal Declaration  in my view  is asrelevant today as it was five decades ago when it wasdrafted by the representatives of developed anddeveloping countries with important input from membersof civil society. It is a universal benchmark.37We all have questions to answer. The first might be:How have we lived up to the standards set out in theUniversal Declaration? What steps have we taken to buildon the Declaration and Programme of Action  adopted fiveyears ago by consensus at the Vienna Conference  whichspecifically reaffirmed the right to development? These aresome questions that we might well ask ourselves during thecurrent session of the Assembly.On the question of capital punishment  anotherimportant human rights issue is the abuse of the deathpenalty. Ireland will continue to work for the universalabolition of capital punishment. We welcome the fact thatthe United Nations Commission on Human Rights  again atits recent fifty-fourth session  addressed this issue directly.We also welcome the adoption in July of the Statutefor the International Criminal Court at the internationalconference hosted so effectively by Italy. This is truly alandmark development. Nobody is and nobody should beabove the law. We fervently hope that the Statute will enterinto force on the earliest possible date and that it willsecure universal adherence.Finally  let me join with those many others who havegiven support and encouragement to the Secretary-Generaland the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Thepromotion of international cooperation in this key area mustremain one of this great Organization?s first priorities.On the question of conflict prevention  I now turn tothe maintenance of international peace and security  which of course  is the prime responsibility and prime aim of theUnited Nations. The painful experiences of this decade —notably in the former Yugoslavia  Africa and the MiddleEast — have prompted much soul-searching and  of course analysis.In Kosovo  we are witnessing a humanitariancatastrophe which could replicate the horrors of Bosnia.The international community must take urgent and effectiveaction within the framework of the United Nations toensure that our worst fears are not realized.Another humanitarian disaster faces us in Sudan.Recently  I saw for myself the terrible suffering of itspeople. I visited the epicentre of the famine in Ajip insouthern Sudan  having spent three hours getting there froma town called Lokichokio in northern Kenya  which was astaging post for aid for that part of the terribly blightedcountry of southern Sudan. It is not acceptable that weallow this tragedy to continue. One of the essentialconclusions  here again  is the need to address the originsof conflict and not just the symptoms. Foresight andadaptability are necessary.In this context  I welcome in particular the emphasiswhich the Secretary-General has placed on the need totackle the root causes of conflict in all their complexdiversity. We support his strengthening of United Nationsearly-warning mechanisms and his prioritizing ofpreventive diplomacy. The many strengths and capabilitiesof the United Nations and the regional organizations inthe area of conflict prevention must be harnessed andfocused to achieve greater use of resources.The General Assembly  for its part  is placing evergreater emphasis on conflict prevention. It hascommended not least the efforts of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) and acknowledged the contributionof the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE)  a regional organization which Irelandfully supports.On the question of peacekeeping  in this  the fiftiethanniversary year of United Nations peacekeeping  I wantto pay tribute to the peacekeepers who currently serve theOrganization. They do so often in very difficult anddangerous circumstances. Too many have made theultimate sacrifice. Since 1958  Ireland has been at theforefront of United Nations peacekeeping. In this period some 40 000 Irish peacekeepers have served with theOrganization across the world. Seventy-five of my fellowIrishmen have given their lives.Among Member States  Ireland is currently one ofthe leading troop contributors. My President  Mrs. MaryMcAleese  in one of her earliest official engagements visited our peacekeepers in Lebanon. Again  thisunderlines Ireland?s active commitment to bringing peaceto that part of the world. The world continues to needUnited Nations peacekeeping  but its operations must bebased on sound mandates and have solid political andfinancial support.Colleagues have mentioned the question of UnitedNations reform. Mobilizing the political will to tackle theinterrelated causes of insecurity and conflict  I believe  isonly the first step. The United Nations as an institutionmust be strengthened and given the necessary resourcesto carry through its work. Timely funding by MemberStates is a prerequisite.38Ireland believes that the reform process should not beviewed as a cost-cutting exercise. The wretched expression“downsizing” comes to mind. It is about making theOrganization more effective in the discharge of its Charterfunctions  especially in the economic  social andhumanitarian fields. I welcome the progress achieved todate. Ireland will continue with other like-minded States tobuild partnerships among the membership so that realprogress can be achieved.We have views in relation to the area of SecurityCouncil reform. A reinvigorated United Nations mustinclude a reformed Security Council that reflects therealities and the needs of today?s world. We believe that theCouncil must work more transparently and that itsmembership should be enlarged to ensure a more equitablerepresentation. To this end  we have joined with a group oflike-minded States in putting forward a number of specificproposals. We will continue to work for an agreed outcomeon this issue of crucial importance to the future of thisOrganization of ours.On the question of Ireland?s candidature  Irelandbelieves that all Member States — small  like ourselves  aswell as large — should have an opportunity to serve on theSecurity Council  the body on which the Members of theOrganization have conferred primary responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security. TheAssembly will be aware that Ireland has presented itscandidature for non-permanent membership of the SecurityCouncil for the two-year term 2001-2002. Throughout itsmembership of the United Nations  Ireland has worked toplay a bridge-building role among Member States. As amember of the Security Council  Ireland?s approach wouldsimilarly reflect the interests of the totality of the broadspectrum of the membership.I can give the Assembly some good news aboutNorthern Ireland. My predecessors have by custominformed this Assembly of our efforts to help promotepeace in Northern Ireland. It is my deep privilege therefore  to convey an account of a breakthrough of greatimportance: the Agreement reached by the British and IrishGovernments and eight Northern Ireland parties in Belfaston Good Friday  10 April 1998.The Good Friday Agreement marks a historic newbeginning in relations within Northern Ireland  between theNorth and the South of the island and between Ireland andBritain. It has brought us all a new sense of hope. We havebegun the long walk out of the dark night of division andconflict into the bright sunlight of partnership and harmony.As somebody who has spent almost 40 years in politicallife seeking to encourage such a journey  I am immenselygratified by this development.The Agreement is a complex document  a careful setof checks and balances  a parity of pain and gain. Strikingthat balance of pain and gain on both sides was  in largepart  the task of the main political parties in NorthernIreland. Their decisions called for political courage andmost serious and genuine leadership  which they gave inabundance. But they could not have been taken withouttrust and vision  too — trust  where before there was onlysuspicion  and vision  where before there had only beenself-interest. The leadership of these peacemakers inNorthern Ireland deserves the warmest commendation ofthis Assembly.With the participants drawn from the full spectrumof the political landscape  what we were addressing in thenegotiations was a complex range of problems andperspectives  each with its deep roots in history. If thesecompeting issues were to be addressed satisfactorily  weknew the final Agreement would itself have to becomplex  broad-based and balanced.Achieving agreement in these circumstances was amajor challenge for all of us involved in the long tortuous and difficult negotiations. As one of thoseprivileged to have had such a role  I can verify that therewere times during the long days and nights in CastleBuildings  Belfast  when success seemed like some distantdream. But the determination of all sides not to bedeflected was stronger than any obstacle. On the dawn ofGood Friday  the dream of agreement finally became areality.Critically  the Agreement was emphatically endorsedby the people of Ireland  North and South  in referendumsheld on the same day  the first time that has happened onthe island of Ireland since 1918. One of the profoundconsequences of this democratic endorsement is that neveragain may the name of the people be invoked as a basisfor the shedding of blood in my country and on myisland. From now on  it is manifest that the onlylegitimate force is the force of reason and persuasion.The Good Friday Agreement is a blueprint for ourfuture. Indeed  it may be a blueprint for other regions?futures. But a blueprint can be successful only if it istranslated from word to deed. That vital process ofimplementation is the next great challenge and one thatwe are all now actively addressing. Some elements of the39Agreement are already in place. The new Northern IrelandAssembly has been elected and the 108 members havetaken their seats. Dramatically symbolizing the new era ofpartnership  David Trimble and my good friend SeamusMallon  each representing the two major traditions  havebeen appointed First Minister and Deputy First Minister respectively. The Assembly has made an encouraging andconstructive start. Work is also proceeding on many of theother elements of the Agreement.But institution-building alone  important as it is  willnot be enough. The appalling atrocities of last summer which saw the horrific burning to death of three youngboys  the Quinn brothers  and the merciless massacre andslaughter of 29 people in Omagh underline the reality thatthe Agreement on its own does not guarantee peace. Morethan anything else  what is also required is what SeamusMallon calls a new politics. At the heart of that newpolitics must be a determination to work in a new way forthe wider good. All of us have constituencies to represent but we must find new ways to balance that requirementwith the needs of the wider society. That  I would suggest is what partnership means. That  I would suggest  is whatpartnership is all about. It also shows how trust andreconciliation are built.If the new politics is to work on the island of Ireland we must seek to develop  on the basis of mutual respect new ways of listening to each other; new ways of talkingto each other; new ways of understanding each other; and critically  new ways of working together.We are bringing this century to a close. The existenceof this great Organization of States devoted to peacereflects the turbulence of the decade. Great progress hasbeen made  but a great price has also been paid. Each of usin our own way has had to grapple with the instinct to warand division. The experience of Ireland echoes theexperiences of so many other States. We realized our desirefor independence in the wake of the Great War. Our birthas a State was darkened by the horrors of civil war. We inthe South of the island overcame our divisions  channelledour differences into peaceful politics and have significantlyprospered. In the North  divisions and fears were notchallenged. They festered and brought us almost threedecades of violence.The peace process allowed us to challenge and resolvethe fears and divisions generating the conflict. TheAgreement is a watershed  a harbinger of the new era thatcoincides with the millennium. It is a great  historicrapprochement between nationalism and unionism. All theparticipants in the negotiations together have achieved agreat thing. But it is vital that we say to one another  asI am now again saying to the unionist community  that werecognize that a new era has dawned  in which all the oldshibboleths and the old rhetoric must be replaced by anew dialogue  by a new partnership.It is precisely in this spirit of the new politics thatwe must approach the inevitable difficulties that will arisefrom time to time  including at present those relating tothe establishment of the “shadow” executive in NorthernIreland and to decommissioning. It is in the interests ofall of us who support the Agreement that we resolve thedifficulties to the satisfaction of all concerned. If one side“wins”  everybody loses. That was the approach thatsecured the Good Friday Agreement. If one side “wins” everybody loses.I should like to take the opportunity to pay tribute tothe role of the international community in bringing aboutthe Good Friday Agreement  in particular that of theindependent chairman  former Senator George Mitchell ofthe United States of America  former Prime MinisterHarri Holkeri of Finland and General John de Chastelainof Canada. Their contribution was immense  and Generalde Chastelain?s contribution continues to be. The supportand solidarity  through the process of our partners in thisAssembly  and  in particular  of our partners in theEuropean Union — the President of the Commission andthe Presidencies of the European Union — have beenunparalleled in their contribution  as were the warm andencouraging words of the Secretary-General of thisOrganization. We deeply appreciate it.I want in particular to record our very specialgratitude to the President of the United States  Mr. BillClinton  for his personal commitment to the cause ofpeace in Ireland and for the exceptional solidarity withthe peace process he has displayed at all times throughouthis presidency. He took the opportunity  when headdressed this Assembly last Monday  to mentionNorthern Ireland and Ireland on three or four or fiveoccasions. I think that was an indication of the type ofcommitment he has and will continue to have in theNorthern Ireland peace process.Finally  I would like to underline the central andcrucial roles played by my own Taoiseach  Irish PrimeMinister Bertie Ahern  and by British Prime MinisterTony Blair in the closing days of the negotiations. Theirparticular role was historic and  in my respectful view heroic.40I want to say that  in the spirit of the Charter of thisOrganization  we are ready to reciprocate the solidarity ofthe international community by way of sharing the lessonsof our experience with others  should that be consideredhelpful. It would be a source of immense additionalsatisfaction to Ireland  as a committed Member of theUnited Nations  if the Good Friday Agreement were to behelpful to conflict resolution elsewhere.Finally  and important though international solidaritymay be  the reality is that for us in Ireland  as elsewhere the primary responsibility rests with ourselves. May I recallhere the words of a well-known author which have inspiredvery many:“Mankind must remember that peace is not God?s giftto his creatures; peace is our gift to each other.”With the Good Friday Agreement  we in Ireland haveenjoyed the gift of peace. We do so in the spirit of theCharter of the United Nations. The challenge now is toensure that it is passed to our children and to our children?schildren. I know that the members of this Assembly will bewith us as we address and take up that particular challenge."
"79",3300,"IRN",53,1998,"The light ofhuman existence is kindled by man's longing forsalvation. The essence of the message of divine prophetsand the content of the teachings of prominent sages havebeen primarily aimed at human salvation. It is painful toobserve in the arena of human history the deprivation andabject misery of human beings; the deprivation of women men and children enslaved by the whims of the rulingpowers; and the ill fate of rulers deprived of compassionand sympathy for their own nations. Hence  virtuous ruleand good governance have been evanescent in humanhistory.Ironically  much too often will and freedom ofthought have been frustrated and liberty suffocated in thename of salvation  and much too often salvation has beenportrayed as disposing of any and all restraints oninsatiable human desires. Reason and love have thus beensacrificed at the altar of the whim. At times  liberty hasbeen trampled in the name of justice  and at other timesjustice has been obliterated in the name of freedom. Theresult has been humanityâs age-old deprivation from bothjustice in liberty and liberty in justice.It is only a few centuries since genuine knowledgebegan to be construed as the source of power rather thanan agent of its control. Ever since  knowledge  instead ofserving human salvation and exalting human character has been used as an instrument in the hands of thosewhose only object is to advance their own narrow utilitarian self-interest.Despite its magnificent progress  humanity hassuffered massively over these centuries fromdiscrimination and anguish. Survivors are still among uswho can testify to the incalculable destruction caused bythe two world wars  and despite the birth of the UnitedNations â€” a positive achievement for mankind â€” truepeace based on justice still remains a scarcity.Particularly desperate is the situation of the countriesin the underdeveloped world  where so many still sufferfrom famine  illiteracy and disease  and some remain atthe mercy of rulers who do not even take the trouble ofpretending to respect democratic standards or enjoypopular support. So often they attempt to replace theabsence of popular support by dependence on powerwhose sole purpose is the pursuit of domination and self-interest.Oppressive and dependent governments deny theirpeople the opportunity to experience democracy byperpetuating intimidation and terror in society  and they3promote a culture of violence which inadvertently leadstheir opponents to resort to the same. The powers that breedand nurture such regimes can therefore not escape blame.Primarily responsible here are those powers whoseintelligence services take pride in their dark record ofoverthrowing popular governments and supportingunpopular ones.This image of our world is indeed grim and repulsive.Until the day that the wise and the learned wrest the reinsof power from the unwise and the capricious  this imagecannot at all be transformed.Nonetheless  in my opinion  beyond the darkness anddoom  genuine beauty can still be discerned in the deeperlayers of history. I can assert with certitude that  on thewhole  human life has blossomed spiritually and materially.Anti-colonial struggles and independence movements ofmany nations in this century exemplify this blossoming andprogress. The collapse of the bipolar world order in thefinal decade of this century and the swift march of theworld towards diversity  coupled with renewed assertion ofidentity in the international arena by nations demandingequality  are other significant achievements in this direction.The fantasy of a unipolar world ruled by a singlesuper-Power is but an illusion  indicating the failure of itsholders to keep pace with history. I am confident thatpowerful nations  such as the American people  will notaccept that their good name  potential and national prestigebe exploited for the advancement of the dream of aunipolar world by the politicians  motivated by the short-sighted material and factional interests of a few. Theevolution of public opinion in the West in support ofpeaceful relations on the basis of mutual respect testifies tothis assertion.Now allow me to speak here as a man from the East the origin of brilliant civilizations and the birthplace ofdivine prophets â€” Abraham  Moses  Jesus and Mohammed peace be upon them all. I come from the noble land of Iran representing a great and renowned nation famed for itsancient civilization  as well as for its distinguishedcontribution to the founding and expansion of the Islamiccivilization  a nation that has survived the strong winds ofdespotism  reaction and submission  relying on its culturaland human wealth. It is a nation which pioneered in theEast the establishment of civil society and constitutionalgovernment in the course of its contemporary history  eventhough  as a result of foreign interference and domesticdeficiencies  at times it may have faltered in its course; anation which has been at the forefront of the struggle forindependence and against colonialism  although itsnational movement was subverted by a foreign-orchestrated coup. And it is a nation which carries thetorch of its popular revolution  not won by force of armsor a coup  but by dethroning a regime of coup dâÃ©tatthrough the power of the enlightened word. In the courseof its new experience  our nation has endured eight yearsof an imposed war  pressure  sanctions and various unfairaccusations. It has also fallen victim to terrorism  theominous phenomenon of the twentieth century.Today  the Iranian nation draws on its past tocontemplate a better future  while defying reactionarytendencies and  backed by principles and ideals rooted inits religious  national  historical and revolutionary heritageand benefiting from positive achievements ofcontemporary civilization  marches  be it through trial anderror  towards a promising tomorrow.The Islamic revolution of the Iranian people was arevolt of reason against coercion and suppression.Certainly  a revolution which resorted to logic in thephase of destruction is much better disposed to resort todialogue and reason in the phase of construction. Hence it calls for a dialogue among civilizations and culturesinstead of a clash between them.From this rostrum and the pulpit of the UnitedNations  I announce that humanity  despite all calamitiesand hardships  is heading towards emancipation andliberty. This is the unalterable divine providence andhuman destiny. The malice and depravity of no individualcan ever violate divine providence and the course ofhistory.The word â€œhistoryâ€ predates â€œphilosophyâ€  and manis the pillar of history. History itself is the reflection ofthe light of being upon various facets and dimensions ofhuman existence. Thus  it is a unique and universal entity albeit diverse in nature. Whenever this unique entity takeson a new guise  a new era is ushered in. Our assessmentof history indeed emanates from our perception ofhumanity â€” its pivot and pillar.Human beings  who  in the Persian poet Saadiâseloquent description borrowed from a saying of the holyProphet of Islam  are various organs of the same body are outside the reach of biology or psychology.Understanding human beings requires a philosophical andreflective view of man and history. God created man withHis own hand and in His own image  and He breathedinto him of His own spirit  and thus humanity is but a4single entity  and so is its history. The hand of God grantedhumankind history  will and freedom of choice; the imageof God provided him culture  spirituality and liberty; andthe spirit of God bestowed upon him life and vitality. Thus human beings have come to possess history  culture andliberty.Not only do all human beings originate from one andthe same origin and share a continuous and integratedhistory  but also one may further postulate a single finalpurpose. This purpose of history is none other than spiritualculture  and genuine human liberty is its absoluteprerequisite.Whether or not one subscribes to the view that man isdoomed to whirl in iterative historical cycles or to grapplewith historical moments or epochs  and whether or not oneholds history to be self-driven  driven by human urges  bymodes of production or by superhuman heroes  everyonecan agree that it is only the ever-inspiring fountain of faiththat breaks every old and new shackle from humanity andarrests the iterative eternal cycle  eventually emancipatinghumankind from the bounds of historical determinism  justas it is only the vivifying breeze of liberty that can offerfaith and spirituality to humanity.It is thus that humankind could  in consonance withthe mystic Persian poet Hafez  serenade thatâ€œI will subvert this high inverted vault if it should ererotate 'gainst my dictate.â€Or  in the words of the Gospel according to Saint Mark if one had faith in God one could say to the mountainâ€œBe thou removed  and be thou cast into the seaâ€ (TheHoly Bible  Mark 11:23)Through such an understanding of freedom  the tenetsof human dignity can be upheld in the face of politicaldomination and virtue  and hope against baneful blasts ofdespair and nihilism. Here  one can discern the trajectory ofhistory towards liberty.The history of humankind is the history of liberty.Only that interpretation which describes history as the arenafor manifestation of liberty can provide an opening of thepast for the benefit of mankind. Regardless of allphilosophical systems that have attempted to attributemeanings  directions and laws of evolution to history  wecan realize that because human history is intertwined withthe history of liberty  when human beings are liberatedfrom imposed constraints of exploitation and socialenslavement  as well as from unrefined animal instinctssuch as violence and savagery  they will then side withtruth and justice in line with their human nature. Thence human history shall become the glorious history of truthand realization of justice. And this could be anotherexpression of the famous religious doctrine ofMessianism.Whether we embark on an empirical and inductivestudy of history or an intuitive one  most thinkers wouldagree that the essence of humanity has flourished and thatmore veils of ignorance have been removed from theminds of human beings.I have deliberately used the word â€œflourishedâ€instead of the more common terms  such as â€œhistoricalprogressâ€  in order to emphasize that  whatever school ofphilosophy of history we may follow  we can still sharean understanding of this general and universal conceptionof history.The establishment and continued functioning of theUnited Nations is a testament to the progressive path ofthe world and of human history. Today it does not requiremuch argument to establish that instead of war andbloodshed one could and indeed ought to resort todiscourse and dialogue. That fact has not been achievedeasily  as if the bloodstained history of humanity forms anantecedent to this seemingly simple proposition.Yet so long as imprudent potentates can obliterateflowers and trees  hope and mirth from the face of theEarth with a quick stroke of their folly and cruelty  it ispremature to celebrate the ultimate triumph of the Logosover the sword.The twentieth century did not only witness themanifestations of violence and human sufferings at thehands of old colonialists and the unprecedented injusticeof their modern heirs; it was also the century of the riseand fall of totalitarian regimes. Let us hope that in thecoming century resort to force and violence shall not beglorified and that the essence of political power shall becompassion and justice  externally manifested in dialoguebetween civilizations.The question is how the United Nations may takethe necessary measures to respond to this evolving globalclimate  and what impact it will have on the changingcourse of the life of mankind longing for salvation.5I would like to propose  in the name of the IslamicRepublic of Iran  that the United Nations  as a first step designate the year 2001 as the â€œYear of Dialogue AmongCivilizationsâ€  in the earnest hope that through such adialogue the realization of universal justice and liberty maybe initiated.Among the worthiest achievements of this century isthe acceptance of the necessity and significance of dialogueand the rejection of force  the promotion of understandingin the cultural  economic and political fields  and thestrengthening of the foundations of liberty  justice andhuman rights. The establishment and enhancement ofcivility  whether at the national or international level  iscontingent upon dialogue among societies and civilizationsrepresenting various views  inclinations and approaches. Ifhumanity  at the threshold of the new century andmillennium  devotes all its efforts to institutionalizingdialogue  replacing hostility and confrontation withdiscourse and understanding  it will leave an invaluablelegacy for the benefit of future generations.Similarly  it is necessary that as members of theUnited Nations we revisit the history of the formation ofthis Organization  with a view to reforming and improvingthe institution through a rational exchange of views.The United Nations took shape in a dark era of humanhistory  when many of its current members were stillexperiencing the bitter and abominable conditions ofcolonial rule. As a consequence  the new Organizationreflected the domination of the powerful few. Things havechanged now  and the opportunity has presented itself torestructure this Organization  particularly its SecurityCouncil. Here I would like to refer to the wise statement ofthe leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran in his inauguraladdress to the Eighth Session of the Islamic SummitConference  held in Tehran  that the Islamic countries representing one billion and several hundred million people should acquire a permanent seat in the United NationsSecurity Council  with the same privileges as currentpermanent members  as long as they are enjoyed by thosemembers.The time has come to reject  through understanding the discriminatory veto privilege  and in so doing takeanother step towards the recognition of fair and equal rightsof all Member States.Let us all join hands in solidarity against genocide aggression and the humiliation of mankind in variouscorners of the world. Let us prevent the continuation ofshameful tragedies which have tarnished the face of thiscentury in Palestine  Afghanistan and Kosovo  and inmany other parts of Africa  Asia and Latin America.Peace and security in the Middle East  imperative asthey are  will only be established through the recognitionof the right of all Palestinians to exercise sovereignty overtheir ancestral homeland. The presently occupied Al-Qudsal-Sharif ought to be the house of dialogue andunderstanding. Resonating from the depth of history  itsvoice speaks intrinsically against racism and Zionism.Great monotheistic religions can live peacefully togetherin Al-Quds al-Sharif  but it is the very Israeli rule that hasmade such a coexistence impossible. Palestine is thehome of all Palestinians â€” Muslims  Christians andJews â€” and not a laboratory for the violent whims ofZionists.In Afghanistan  there is no military solution to thatcountryâs predicament. The universal outrage at themassacre and genocide being perpetrated there â€”particularly the tragic killing of Iranian diplomats and ajournalist  as well as at the continued captivity of theIranian aid workers in the hands of the Taliban â€” callsfor sober analysis and expeditious action to bring theperpetrators of these crimes to justice.Afghanistan  the land of people of dignity andculture  has now been turned into a haven for violence terrorism and the production of and trafficking innarcotics. The Afghan people  as other peoples in theworld  have the inalienable right to determine their owndestiny and the right to enjoy a broad-based Governmentrepresenting all ethnic groups  communities andtendencies in that country. This is the only way to restoretranquillity in Afghanistan. This requires resoluteinternational cooperation in order to inhibit the lucrativeand deadly business of producing and smugglingnarcotics  illicit trafficking in weapons and cultivation ofterrorism. The United Nations  in cooperation with theOrganization of the Islamic Conference and all concernedStates  should bring all the parties to the conflict to thenegotiating table  paving the way for the tyrannized anddestitute Afghan people to freely determine their owndestiny and  backed by solemn global support  shouldbring the rogue elements into compliance with the will ofthe international community. Simultaneously theOrganization should plan for the mobilization of requisiteinternational assistance for the reconstruction ofAfghanistan once the necessary political conditions are inplace.6In Kosovo  the legitimate rights of the embattledpeople should be recognized  and the Yugoslav Governmentshould be made to respect these rights.Honest and sincere efforts to combat terrorism in allits forms and manifestations  including state terrorism constitute another important priority for the Government ofthe Islamic Republic of Iran. Terrorism is a product ofdesperation and nihilism. In a world swirling in the orbit ofviolence and oppression  serious combat against terrorismwill not advance beyond the realm of words and slogans.The eradication of terrorism must be concurrent with aglobal search for justice.This assertion should in no way be interpreted as ajustification for any form of terrorism. As required by ourreligious  moral and cultural values and norms  weunequivocally oppose all forms and manifestations ofterrorism  and we shall combat it vigorously and earnestly.In our view  in order to eradicate this menace  we shouldengage in serious and transparent international cooperationto combat terrorism  and at the same time redouble ourefforts to attain the objective of global justice.At the threshold of the third millennium  the worldalso needs to be liberated from the nightmare of nuclearwar and weapons of mass destruction. Recent nuclear testsin our region  which have led to further complications make this all the more imperative. We should all realizethat the idea of attaining security through the acquisition ofsuch armaments is nothing but an illusion.The manifestation of a resolute global determinationto eliminate all existing arsenals of weapons of massdestruction within an agreed time-frame would provide aclear objective and lend credence and add dynamism to theinternational efforts against the production and proliferationof these deadly weapons. The establishment of zones freefrom weapons of mass destruction  particularly in theMiddle East  constitutes an appropriate first step inalleviating tension and mistrust emanating from theseweapons. We in the Islamic Republic of Iran  as victims ofthe use of weapons of mass destruction  are more cognizantthan anyone else of their horrifying impact. We shall thusstay at the forefront of international efforts to establish andstrengthen universal arrangements for their destruction.Security  development and prosperity in the thirdworld require the promotion of cooperation and theutilization of proven arrangements and mechanisms forconfidence-building. In this regard  it is encouraging thatthe Eighth Islamic Summit Conference in Tehran  cognizantof this necessity  established an appropriate mechanism tofoster confidence through dialogue among Islamiccountries.As a first step in this direction  I invite ourneighbours in the Persian Gulf region  who havewitnessed two destructive wars in the span of one decade to establish a security and cooperation system in the area.In short  confidence and peace cannot be attainedwithout a sober revision of the mentality of the cold war.The advancement and promotion of a culture of peace iscontingent upon the recognition of the constructive role ofnations coupled with avoidance of domination unilateralism  confrontation and exclusion.The Islamic Republic of Iran  in keeping with itsfundamental beliefs and deep-rooted heritage ofcivilization  seeks a world blessed with peace andtranquillity based on human dignity. It has accorded thehighest priority in its foreign policy to the removal oftension. In line with the principles of the Islamicrevolution  Iran is determined to follow its balancedpolicy of expanding relations with its neighbours andother countries on the basis of respect for independenceand equality of rights.Comprehensive peace  over and above peace amonghuman beings  also calls for peace between mankind andnature  which in turn requires that mankind bring to a haltthe systematic devouring of nature and instead emphasizesthe coordination of man and nature. The preservation ofthe environment  as the common natural heritage ofmankind  constitutes a most important priority of thecoming century.Before concluding  I would like to emphasize theparamount role of the family  women and youth in themaking of a better tomorrow and the consolidation of thefoundations of civil society throughout the globe.The family is the unique setting for human progressand the development of the personal and social identity ofindividuals. Regrettably  today  especially in theindustrialized countries  the foundations of home andfamily have been undermined  threatening the emotional material and spiritual health of human life. A global effortis required to confront this danger  lest the flames of thiscentre of warmth  affection and education be graduallydimmed by the cold and vicious winds of alluringfacades  lust and material gain.7Efforts at the global level geared to the promotion andstrengthening of respect for women and their rights requirea critical reassessment of the traditional and inappropriateviews about women. The traditional outlook  based on theerroneous notion of the superiority of men over women does injustice to men  women and humanity as a whole.Equally nefarious is the view that disregards the differencesbetween men and women. We should recognize that bothmen and women are valuable components of humanity whoequally possess the potential for intellectual  social  culturaland political development  and that comprehensive andsustainable development is possible only through the activeparticipation of both men and women in social life.At the threshold of the new millennium  the UnitedNations should have faith in the new generation  to whomthe next century belongs. It should thus be prepared toaccept and embrace the requirements of believing in youth.Let us bring ourselves to accept that we are not custodiansof youth and that the young do have the right to enjoy thesocial process of growth and development  a right theyshould exercise consciously and wilfully. With such a newperspective  and drawing upon the dynamic ability andintellectual capability of the new generation  we cantogether chart a much better and brighter future for the nextcentury."
"80",3347,"IRQ",53,1998,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Opertti on hiselection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session. I am fully confident that his experienceand skill will ensure the success of the work of thissession.The world continues to labour under events that attestto the inability of the international community to avert theeffects of international transformations which carry withinthem the elements of tension and conflict  given theimbalance at the international level caused by a unipolarsystem wherein a sole dominant player in the internationalarena seeks to impose its hegemony on the internationalcommunity. That sole player is not concerned except withits selfish and narrow interests  and with imposing itsdominance over international institutions andorganizations. As a result  the United Nations faces aserious challenge represented by the degree of its abilityto regain the balance required of it in order to accomplishits objectives as set forth in the Charter.In this context  the United Nations witnessesattempts to reform its structures and work mechanism tomake it compatible with the current political andeconomic realities. Most important is the effort to reformthe working methods of the General Assembly and theSecurity Council in order to bring the work of these twoorgans into full harmony with the evolution ofinternational relations and with the increased membershipof the international Organization. This evolution requiresequitable representation of States from the variouscontinents on the Security Council  whether throughpermanent or non-permanent membership. The success ofthese efforts depends largely on the serious political willof Member States of our Organization. The reform of thework of the Security Council is urgently needed  if we areto end control over it by a few States and transform itinto an institution which truly represents internationalrealities. Without these reforms  it is impossible toachieve the purposes and the principles of the Charterwith regard to the maintenance of peace and security promoting economic and social development andstrengthening cooperation among people.13International peace and security are affected by theirrational and biased character of the way issues ofdisarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  areaddressed. There are States which maintain huge arsenalsof weapons of mass destruction  including nuclear chemical  biological or long-range missiles  while otherStates are being disarmed or called upon to disarmthemselves under all sorts of pretexts. The proper approachin this regard is in the comprehensive implementation ofthe relevant international treaties and comprehensiveagreements  free of selectivity and discrimination. Then and only then  can the goal of general and completedisarmament be put to the service of the cause of peace andsecurity in the world and of ensuring the legitimate rightsof States to defend their security and independence in a justand equitable manner.The Middle East region is witnessing today a gravesituation and serious impairment of the balance of powers.The Zionist entity possesses a huge arsenal of weapons ofmass destruction of all types — nuclear in particular chemical  biological or long-range missiles — in disregardof the General Assembly’s efforts to render the Middle Easta zone free of weapons from mass destruction; of SecurityCouncil resolution 487 (1981)  which demands that theZionist entity place its installations under thecomprehensive safeguards of the International AtomicEnergy Agency; and of paragraph 14 of Security Councilresolution 687 (1991)  which states that the actions to betaken towards Iraq represent steps towards the goal ofestablishing in the Middle East a zone free of weapons ofmass destruction. This situation  resulting from the Zionistentity’s failure to comply with these resolutions  threatenssecurity and peace in the region and in the entire world and encourages an arms race in the region.Iraq strongly affirms its support for the struggle of thePalestinian people against Zionist settler colonialism inPalestine. It supports the struggle of the Palestine LiberationOrganization for the realization of its legitimate objectives endorsed by the international community  which affirms theinalienable rights of the Palestinians in Palestine  includingits capital  Al-Quds al-Sharif.The comprehensive  inhumane blockade imposed onIraq has entered its ninth year. This blockade has causedand continues to cause the death of thousands of Iraqicitizens every month due to the lack of medicine and foodand a grave deterioration in the infrastructures of theindustrial  agricultural  health  education  service sectors andother areas. This situation calls for the strong condemnationof those who insist  for ulterior political motives  oncontinuing to inflict on the Iraqi people this destructiveblockade  the tragic consequences of which aretantamount to internationally proscribed acts of genocide.Security Council resolution 687 (1991) contains twosets of obligations: those which must be fulfilled by Iraq and those that require the Security Council to lift theblockade on Iraq when Iraq has met its obligations.The obligations imposed on Iraq concerndisarmament. Briefly  they require the destruction removal or rendering harmless  under the supervision ofthe United Nations Special Commission and theInternational Atomic Energy Agency  of all weapons ofmass destruction which were in Iraq’s possession. Theyenjoin Iraq to refrain from the production  possession stockpiling  use or development of such weapons in theareas prohibited by resolution 687 (1991)  which are theballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometresand chemical and biological weapons  together with thenuclear programme. These obligations imposed on Iraqalso provide for the establishment of a system of ongoingmonitoring  verification and registration of compliance.In return for the achievement of the above  withregard to the elimination of the prohibited weapons paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991) provides that theprohibition against the import of basic commodities andproducts originating in Iraq and the prohibition againstfinancial transactions related thereto contained in Councilresolution 661 (1990) shall cease to remain in effect.Throughout the past seven and one-half years  Iraqhas fully cooperated with the Security Council  theSpecial Commission and the International Atomic EnergyAgency. Iraq has met all the conditions and obligationsimposed on it as an expression of its good will and inorder to have the blockade imposed on its people lifted.All prohibited weapons have been destroyed over thepast seven and one-half years  together with hundreds ofplants  installations and equipment related to thoseweapons. The operations were carried out with so muchvengefulness that they even included cooling and lightingequipment  as well furnishings and other items that hadnothing to do with the prohibited weapons or with theirproduction. Since 1994  the Special Commission and theInternational Atomic Energy Agency have established acomprehensive system of strict monitoring.However  although Iraq has fully implemented allthe requirements of resolution 687 (1991) concerning14disarmament  the Security Council has not taken any actionto implement its own obligations towards Iraq  asprescribed by paragraph 22 of that same resolution.Questions which must be legitimately addressed to theSecurity Council are: why should Iraq bear all theseburdens and losses while the blockade continues and no oneknows when it is going to be lifted? Why has the SecurityCouncil been unable so far to discharge its obligationstowards Iraq?Iraq has cooperated throughout the past seven and onehalf years with the Security Council  the SpecialCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agencyand has met all the requirements of the Security Council’sresolutions in the hope that its cooperation would lead tolifting the blockade imposed on the people of Iraq.However  the blockade has not yet been lifted  thusrendering the continuation of cooperation both meaninglessand useless.The Special Commission entrusted with pursuing theimplementation of Iraq’s obligations under the provisions ofresolution 687 (1991)  which concerns disarmament anddirects the monitoring system established since 1994 refrains — I repeat  refrains — from reporting the factsabout Iraq’s compliance with its obligations under SecurityCouncil resolutions. The reason for its failure to do so ispolitical. The Special Commission and its Chairman operateunder the influence of an arrogant  powerful State that ispursuing ulterior political aims against Iraq that have norelevance whatsoever to Security Council resolutions onIraq.For political reasons  the Special Commission and itsChairman refrain from reporting to the Council that Iraq istotally free of all weapons prohibited under resolution 687(1991) in the three areas of missiles and chemical andbiological weapons  even though the Special Commissionhas no concrete evidence to prove the opposite. The SpecialCommission and its Chairman both refrain from reportingto the Council that all the plants  equipment andinstallations which the Commission itself determined hadanything to do with those weapons have been destroyed andthat the remaining plants  equipment and installationscapable of so-called dual-use are totally under acomprehensive and strict monitoring system. Accordingly Iraq is incapable of resuming the production of suchweapons. Finally  the Special Commission and its Chairmanrefrain  also for political reasons  from reporting to theCouncil that since the establishment of the monitoringsystem in 1994 the Commission has not noted any violationon the part of Iraq with regard to resuming the productionof the prohibited weapons.This prejudiced position on the part of the SpecialCommission and its Chairman has brought action to adead end and into an unacceptable vicious circle. Iraq wastherefore obliged to suspend cooperation with the SpecialCommission and the International Atomic Energy Agencybecause insisting on dead-end paths and vicious circlescan only lead to the continuation of the blockade on thepeople of Iraq  which is unacceptable and even contraryto resolution 687 (1991).In order to seek a way out of this deadlock andbreak out of the vicious circle created by the SpecialCommission and its Chairman  Iraq has welcomed theproposal for a comprehensive review submitted by theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  to the SecurityCouncil last 6 August. Iraq has emphasized that such acomprehensive review is a legal and moral obligationwhich the Council is duty-bound to discharge. By theterms of resolution 687 (1991)  the Council is required toimplement paragraph 22  relating to lifting theprohibitions against the import of basic commodities andproducts originating in Iraq  based upon the completionby Iraq of all actions contemplated in part C of theresolution. The Council is also required to undertake areview every 60 days aimed at either reducing or liftingthe embargo in the light of the implementation by Iraq ofall its obligations under the relevant Council resolutions.However  the 40 reviews carried out so far have been amere formality  arbitrary and far from comprehensive.Thus  embarking upon a real comprehensive reviewin accordance with the Secretary-General’s proposal is nota reward given to Iraq  but a duty that the SecurityCouncil has to undertake under its own resolutions. Iraqhas expressed its willingness to participate effectively insuch a comprehensive review — it is one of itsinalienable rights. Iraq has also expressed its hope thatsuch a comprehensive review of what it has accomplishedin terms of disarmament under part C of resolution 687(1991) will be made as soon as possible and withoutfurther delay. It is our hope that it will be indeedcomprehensive  fair and honest and that Iraq will be givenevery possible opportunity to submit its point of view onall relevant questions that might be posed by the SpecialCommission  the IAEA or members of the SecurityCouncil. Iraq also hopes that the review will be conductedunder the personal supervision of the Secretary-Generaland that Mr. Annan will see to it that such acomprehensive review is bound by a clearly defined15timetable and not allow it to be an aimless process withoutforeseeable end.While we support carrying out such a comprehensivereview in an objective  fair and impartial manner  we affirmIraq’s right to expect the Security Council to proceed totake action to lift the inhumane sanctions that have beenimposed on the people of Iraq for eight years now. Thepeople and leadership of Iraq will accept no less."
"81",3394,"ISL",53,1998,"Allow me at the outsetto congratulate Mr. Opertti upon his election to hisprestigious position. I am convinced that he will guide uswisely through the fifty-third session of the GeneralAssembly.The world community is now confronted withseveral dangerous situations which threaten the existenceof millions of people  situations which demand immediateaction by our Organization. I would like to draw specialattention to the plight of the people of Kosovo and thealarming situation in several countries in Africa  wherewars have caused appalling suffering and directly threatenthe development and advancement of the whole continent.Our Organization is also confronted with issues of auniversal nature which can determine the future ofhumankind  such as the protection of the environment andthe delicate balance between economic growth and theconservation of natural resources. In this respect  theprotection of the oceans and the marine ecosystem is oneof the most important tasks facing us today.The fact that this is the International Year of theOcean allows me to draw the Assembly?s attention to thefact that the oceans are the single largest source of proteinand a crucial part of Earth?s ecosystem. We have to cometo grips with the reality that the ocean?s bounty is finiteand that the ocean is not a bottomless receptacle ofhuman waste and pollution.Pollution of the seas from land-based sourcesremains a daunting problem. However  effectiveimplementation of the Washington Global Programme ofAction will certainly bring about much improvement inthis respect. Pollution by persistent organic pollutants isanother major concern. Prompt completion by the year2000 of a legally binding instrument dealing with some ofthese pollutants will be an important step towardsreducing and eventually eliminating this kind of pollution.Accidents in which radioactive material from nuclearwaste treatment plants has spilled into the sea havedemonstrated clearly the dangers of such facilities. Under34no circumstances should such plants be allowed to operatenear the ocean. It is my hope that our generation will takethe necessary measures so that future generations inheritclean oceans free from contamination.Nations with similar interests must strive foragreements on sharing and sensibly managing commonstocks and fisheries on the high seas. We must ensure thatthe harvesting of living marine resources can continue andthat economic development and conservation go hand inhand. In order to ensure a vibrant and profitable fisheriessector  States need to introduce the principles of privateenterprise into the fishing industry and make its productscompete on the free market. In Iceland we have devised amarket-driven fisheries management system whichencompasses both conservation of our resources and theirsustainable use.The fishing stocks in the exclusive economic zonearound Iceland have been steadily growing since a systemof individual transferable fishing quotas was implementedin order both to achieve desired economic objectives and toprotect our resources. However  fisheries in many parts ofthe world are overexploited. In my view  this is mainly dueto the fisheries sector?s being inundated with governmentsubsidies  resulting in excess fishing capacity and thedistortion of market principles. No other single action couldbring about such positive results  in a short time  towardsachieving sustainable development in fisheries as theelimination of government subsidies.I would like to note that when we read United Nationspublications dealing with the state of the world?s fisherieswe are continually confronted with the expression“overfishing”  not “fishing”. This implies  first  thatfisheries everywhere are utilized to the hilt  and  secondly that States in general have failed in the management of theresources inside their economic zones. This gives a wrongpicture of the situation.I wish to draw the Assembly?s attention to aninteresting study issued a few weeks ago by the WorldWildlife Fund on the root causes of the depletion of fishresources in many parts of the world. The study states thatovercapacity in fishing fleets is a key factor and thatGovernment subsidies of this industry is another. It rightlypoints out that one solution to this problem would be toissue each fishing vessel tradeable rights to a percentage ofthe catch. It goes on to say that this system has workedwell in New Zealand  Australia and Iceland.In the negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol to theUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange we stressed that the further harnessing ofIceland?s abundant  clean and renewable energy sourcescould contribute towards the global effort to limitgreenhouse gas emissions. Iceland has for decades placedspecial emphasis on the utilization of clean and renewableenergy sources  such as geothermal energy andhydropower. Of its own accord  and through extensiveinvestment  Iceland has replaced fossil fuels for spaceheating and electricity generation with clean andrenewable energy sources. Those efforts  made prior to1990  have severely limited the possibilities for Iceland tofurther reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.In our view  it must be recognized that the economyof some countries is dependent on few natural resources.They therefore have fewer options to secure theireconomic base by comparison with countries with diverseeconomies. It is both illogical and unfair to deny countriesthe right to harness and utilize clean and renewableenergy. Such a result would run counter to the objectiveof the Convention and be incompatible with Agenda 21.This year?s substantive session of the Economic andSocial Council demonstrated clearly that the industrializedcountries must make a concentrated effort to removebarriers to trade and integrate the developing countriesinto global markets. Many developing countries now haveflourishing private sectors  competing in world markets.Last month I had the pleasure of visiting somecountries in the southern part of Africa  of observing theenormous human and natural wealth of these countriesand of learning first hand about the possibilities availableto the people there. It is clear that peace has broughtprosperity to those countries. My country is engaged indevelopment cooperation in that area  focusing on humancapacity-building as well as training and education in thefield of fisheries. It should be stressed that  parallel to theprivatization of the economy  there must be increasedfunding for building up social services  health care andeducation. It is my firm intention that Iceland shallincrease its official development assistance to our partnercountries in Africa. This fall  I had the pleasure ofwelcoming the first students  coming from three Africancountries  of the new United Nations University FisheriesTraining Programme in Iceland. We hope that in thefuture students from all parts of the world will come fortraining in all aspects of the fishing industry.35I would especially like to draw attention to theimportance of strengthening the position and role of womenin society  mainly with regard to their education and activeparticipation in the economy. In this respect  we have totackle the problem of overpopulation with comprehensivesolutions.The volatility in the world?s financial markets has ledto severe recession in many countries and slowed economicgrowth in others. Globalization is a part of the developmentof the world today  and for all countries it entails both risksand benefits. The risks must be borne by all  and thebenefits must be spread evenly and widely  especially to thepoorest.Our Organization has seldom had more urgent tasksthan preserving peace  security and human rights. I wouldlike to express great concern over the nuclear tests recentlyconducted by two countries in South Asia  and I welcomerecent statements by those States that they will adhere tothe provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty.War has visited many countries since we gathered herelast year. Keeping peace requires our constant vigilance. Inseveral African countries war and ethnic tension havebrought death and destruction. The cruel fate of children inwar is more evident now than ever before. Once again thepeople of the former Yugoslavia are confronted with aproblem of tragic proportions. In Kosovo thousands ofrefugees are facing hunger and a cold winter.Conflicts where the civilian population is targeted areabhorrent and leave scars that take a long time to heal. Wenow recognize that preserving peace demands moreintensive measures than before  such as the strengthening ofdemocratic institutions  policing  overseeing elections establishing judiciary systems and monitoring human rights.In many countries it is as though the Middle Ages hadnever ended and the darkness of intolerance  cruelty andhuman rights abuses descends on people?s lives every day.The fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rightsshould encourage us to be stalwart in our principles. Humanrights are universal  and the veil of religion and traditioncannot and will not be accepted as an excuse for toleratingflagrant human rights violations.The international community must deal successfullywith problems such as terrorism and war crimes. The worldcommunity has had to look on in horror as terrorists have in cowardly fashion  targeted innocent people going abouttheir everyday lives. We urge States to sign and ratify thecounter-terrorism conventions. The adoption of the Statuteof the International Criminal Court this summer in Romeshows the firm commitment of the internationalcommunity to let law take precedence over lawlessnessand justice over injustice. Once the court is firmly inplace it is our hope that criminals who commit atrociousacts  such as crimes against humanity  genocide and warcrimes  will have no escape from the long reach ofinternational law. We urge all States to sign and ratify theStatute.We look forward to the effective implementation ofthe agreed outcome of the General Assembly?s specialsession on drugs. Enhancing judicial cooperation and lawenforcement cooperation is essential  as well as bearingdown on money-laundering worldwide. The elimination ofillicit crops should be a high priority in the global drugcontrol strategy.We strongly support the Norwegian and Canadianinitiative to control the proliferation of small arms andlight weapons. The huge number of these weapons shouldbe of great concern to the international community.Our Organization must enter the next millennium asan effective and reformed Organization  with leanmanagement  result-based budget  increased actionpotential in the most vital fields  strengthened financesand a clear commitment from all Member countries topay their contributions without conditions.Finally  Iceland is committed to the ideals of theUnited Nations. We have always been ready to shoulderour responsibilities in every aspect of the Organization?swork because we believe that all Member countriesshould make their mark on events shaping the world welive in today."
"82",3441,"ISR",53,1998,"As the Prime Minister ofIsrael  I represent a State whose creation was envisioned encouraged and advocated by the League of Nations 80years ago and by the United Nations 50 years ago. Thatextraordinary recognition by the international communityconfirmed what the Jewish people have known and felt fortwo millennia: the bond between the people of Israel andthe land of Israel is eternal  and the rebirth of the JewishState in the land of Israel is a historic imperative.Religious and non-religious people alike have viewedthis rebirth as a modern miracle  the realization of thevision of the Hebrew prophets. Yet ever since that miracleoccurred  we have all been hoping that it would beaccompanied by the fulfilment of another biblical prophesy:“nation shall not lift up sword against nation  neithershall they learn war any more.” (The Holy Bible Isaiah 2:4)It was in fact in that spirit that the founders of Israelstretched out the hand of peace to our neighbours in ourDeclaration of Independence some 50 years ago. Now  halfa century later  as we view with pride our nation?sextraordinary accomplishments and achievements  we aredetermined to complete the circle of peace around us. Nopeople have suffered more from war and violence than theJewish people and no one wants peace more than we do. Iknow that that is not a common perception of us. I personally  am often accused of not wanting peace. Nothingcould be further from the truth. I have been on the fields ofbattle. I have seen my comrades fall. I have two smallchildren at home. I want a future free of war — a future ofpeace  for them and for Palestinian children like them.We want peace for us and for the Palestinian people whose prolonged suffering has been one of the cruelconsequences of the wars waged against us. We are willingto make painful compromises for peace. We hope that thePalestinians are ready to make those necessarycompromises as well. What is at stake is our life togetherin a very small land  and there is no reason that we shouldnot be able to live together. All of us are  after all  the sonsand daughters of Abraham.As we search for peace  we naturally encountercrises and stalemates  frustrations and obstacles — that isinevitable in any negotiating process. But onlynegotiations can solve our problems. An outcome whichis not the result of negotiations is an invitation tocontinued conflict. Negotiations accompanied by violenceand threats of violence are an invitation to failure. T h eoption of violence must therefore be totally discarded andpermanently disavowed.Peace will be achieved only by heeding the callmade by two great leaders  the late Egyptian PresidentAnwar Sadat and Israel?s former Prime MinisterMenachem Begin. Twenty-one years ago they declared inJerusalem  “No more war. No more bloodshed”.The Treaty they hammered out at Camp David wasa historic turning point which changed the face of ourregion. It has benefited both countries and brought hopeto all of us  as has the peace with Jordan  which is amodel peace for all our neighbours. King Hussein?scontribution to this peace  his devotion to theadvancement of our relationship and his efforts to helpthe peace process with the Palestinians have beeninvaluable. In the name of the people of Israel and  I amsure  on behalf of all the peoples and Governmentsrepresented in the Assembly  I want to send King Husseinour most heartfelt wishes for a quick and completerecovery.I believe we can achieve a successful peaceagreement with the Palestinians as well. But for thatpeace to endure  it must be based on two principles. Thefirst is security. A peace that cannot be defended will notlast. That is the central lesson of the twentieth century.None of us can afford to forget this lesson  least of all theJewish people. As the Prime Minister of the one JewishState  I must ensure Israel?s ability to defend itself regardless of criticism and misunderstanding by thosewho do not share this responsibility.The second principle of a durable peace isreciprocity. Only agreements honoured by both sides canbe successful. The agreement between Israel and thePalestinians is at bottom based on a simple equation: thePalestinians receive jurisdiction in the territory in whichthey live  and in return they prevent terrorist attacksagainst Israel from those territories. Israel has beenfulfilling its part of this agreement: 100 per cent of thePalestinians in the Gaza district and 98 per cent of thePalestinians in Judean Samaria  known as the West Bank are now living under Palestinian rule. They enjoy the13attributes of self-government: they have their own flag their own executive  legislative and judiciary bodies andtheir own police force.It can no longer be claimed by anyone that Israel isoccupying the Palestinians. We do not govern their lives.But we cannot accept a situation in which they will threatenour lives  and that is of paramount concern to us as weapproach further redeployment.The territory we are negotiating about is virtuallyuninhabited by Palestinians — there are only a fewthousand Bedouins there who roam about. Yet this land isthe canvas on which thousands of years of Jewish historyhave been etched. And it has powerful implications for oursecurity. We should remember that at its widest point Israelis all of 50 miles wide  and should it cede all of the WestBank  as some so cavalierly tell us to do  that distancewould be reduced to the distance between this building andLa Guardia airport. How many Governments and leaderswould put their nations at such risk? None. Yet we areprepared to undertake careful  controlled and calculatedrisks for peace. Nevertheless  to part with one square inchof this land is agonizing for us  and for me personally.Every stone and every hill and valley that I have walked —I know them intimately  as do my people — resonates withour forefathers? footsteps  from the cradle of Jewishcivilization through the biblical kings and prophets and thesages  scholars and poets of Israel  down to our own time.Yet in the spirit of compromise and reconciliation wehave agreed to transfer to Palestinian jurisdiction some ofthis hallowed land  provided that the principles of securityand reciprocity are kept. This means that Israel would retainthe ability to defend itself  and that the Palestinians wouldfulfil their commitments  first and foremost to shunviolence and fight terrorism.Under the Oslo and Hebron agreements  which Isigned  the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Arafatagreed to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure and arrestand prosecute terrorist operatives. They agreed to collectand dispose of illegal weapons  imprison and hand overwanted murderers and reduce the Palestinian police to thenumbers prescribed in the Oslo agreements. That has notbeen done to date. They also agreed to cease the viciousdaily propaganda on official Palestinian television; there areSesame Street programmes which exhort five-year olds tobecome suicide warriors. This  I am afraid  is education forwar  not for peace. And they agreed that they mustcomplete the annulment of the Palestinian Charter  whichcan only be done by the Palestinian National Council. ThatCharter is still on the books and still on the Internet — ifrepresentatives turn it on they can find it. It still calls forIsrael?s destruction thorough armed struggle  which is aeuphemism for terrorism. So I say today to ourPalestinian partners “Choose peace. Fight for peace. Youcannot talk peace and tolerate terrorism”.Of course  terrorism endangers our peace  but it isalso a global cancer. Many leaders today understand this as President Clinton made abundantly clear from this verypodium a few days ago. But what makes the terrorismrooted in the Middle East so pernicious and so dangerousis that the terrorists invoke a distorted  twisted and fanaticinterpretation of Islam  which is very distant fromenlightened Islam. We have no quarrel with Islam. It isone of the world?s great religions  and we haveadmiration and respect for its institutions and itsteachings. But fanatic Islamist terrorism is religionbetrayed  and it not only threatens us but underminesArab Governments and societies. It endangers the peaceof the world.For terrorism to be defeated  terrorists must bepunished and deterred  and the climate of support theyenjoy in various lands must disappear. That is the onlyway that terrorism will decline and its growth be arrestedand that it will ultimately be rooted out from our lives.The elimination of terrorism will undoubtedly leadto prosperity in our region. We envision a market-basedregional economy between Israel  Jordan and thePalestinian Authority. As I speak we are lifting thebarriers to trade  eliminating red tape and promoting jointbusiness ventures between the parties. Trade betweenIsrael and the Palestinians has shot up enormously in thelast two years because our policy is a liberal policy. Ifthings are better for them economically  things are betterfor us. I should like to give an example relating to thetransfer of value added tax (VAT) from Palestinianworkers working in Israel  whose numbers have grownenormously in the last two years. Three years ago wetransferred about 700 million shekels to the PalestinianAuthority from the work of Palestinian workers in Israel.This year that figure will reach 2 billion shekels. That isalmost a threefold increase in three years. Representativesdo not know that; none of them knows that we havedramatically improved the Palestinian economy becausewe believe that life better for them is life better for us.The absence of violence will enable all of us Palestinians  Jordanians  Egyptians and Israelis  and  Imay add  Syrians and Lebanese — this is not a far-14fetched dream; it is certainly one that I have — to reach astandard of living and quality of life now consideredunimaginable. Once we complete the current talks we willbegin negotiations for the final settlement — a finalsettlement of peace with the Palestinian Authority.I urged starting these negotiations a year ago  but Iregret to say that my offer was turned down. This phase islong overdue. But as the late Yitzhak Rabin noted  no datesin the Oslo accords are sacrosanct. No target date in themwas met on schedule. This failure to meet deadlines did notput an end to the agreement. The Oslo accords are notabout meeting deadlines. Their essential purpose is to reacha peace agreement through negotiations.An arbitrary  unilateral declaration of a PalestinianState  in disregard of this basic purpose of Oslo  wouldconstitute a fundamental violation of the Oslo accords. Itwould cause the complete collapse of the process. I stronglyurge the Palestinian Authority not to take this course. Suchactions will inevitably prompt unilateral responses on ourpart  and that development would not be good for thePalestinians  not good for Israel  and not good for peace.We must continue to negotiate  earnestly  continuouslyand tirelessly until a final peace agreement is reached. Noother way will do.What would such a peace look like? I envision itssuccess would lie in ensuring the following balance: thePalestinians should have all the powers to govern their livesand none of the powers to threaten our lives. They willhave control of all aspects of their society  such as law religion and education; industry  commerce and agriculture;tourism  health and welfare. They can prosper and flourish.What they cannot do is endanger our existence. We have aright to ensure that the Palestinian entity does not becomethe base for hostile forces  including foreign forces. Wehave a right to ensure that it does not become a base andhaven for terrorists. In some cases we are talking about abase — in New York city terms — five blocks away  andwithout the East River. We are talking about something thatis not hypothetical.As I prepared this speech  I was informed of aterrorist attack — another one — in Jerusalem  in a busstation. Happily  no one was killed today. But can we besure? We are seeking a peace that is peaceful  that is notviolent — a peace without terror  which is the only peacethat means anything.Nor can we accept the mortal threat of weapons suchas anti-aircraft missiles on the hills above our cities andairfields. If any representatives were to land at Tel Avivairport — as many have in the past — their planes couldbe endangered by the inability of Israel  in a permanentpeace settlement  to control the importation of these lethalweapons. This is the great challenge of the permanentstatus negotiations: to achieve a durable peace that willstrike a balance between Palestinian self-rule and Israelisecurity. This peace can be achieved by negotiation  andnegotiation alone. There is no other way.Negotiation for peace is what we want with Lebanonand Syria as well. As representatives know  over sixmonths ago our Government announced an initiative toimplement Security Council resolution 425 (1978). In ourdecision  we said that Israel was prepared to withdrawfrom south Lebanon provided that one condition was met:that there would be security arrangements to ensure thesafety of the civilian population on both sides of theLebanese-Israeli border.I can report that I find myself now in the bizarreposition of offering to withdraw from an Arab countryand meeting with Arab refusal to negotiate such awithdrawal. But I can also report that we remain hopeful.We have not abandoned this initiative.Peace with Syria and Lebanon will complete thecircle of peace with our immediate neighbours. But theachievement of a lasting peace in our region requiresaddressing the ominous existential dangers which stillthreaten Israel beyond the immediate horizon. Both Iranand Iraq continue their efforts to acquire non-conventionalweapons and ballistic missiles with strategic reach. Iranhas just successfully tested an intermediate-range missile.Iraq has declared that it will no longer acceptinternational inspections of its non-conventionalprogrammes  inspections mandated by Security Councilresolutions.These developments threaten not only Israel  but allthe nations represented in this Hall. In the hands of therogue regimes of the Middle East  weapons of massdestruction may pose a greater threat to the world  and toworld peace  than anything we have known in the past. Iwant to caution members about something else: to letsweet talk by leaders of these regimes lull us into inactionis to repeat the worst mistakes of this century. What isrequired instead is concerted international action toprevent disaster.15That  after all  is what this body was established to do.And if it is to live up to its founders? expectations  it willhave to be far more adept at distinguishing betweenfanatical aggressors and their intended victims. I believethat the United Nations can help foster a climate of peaceand stability in our region by encouraging the reactivationof the multilateral committees conceived at the MadridConference. By addressing such issues as regionaleconomic development  arms control  the resolution ofrefugee problems  water and the environment  thesecommittees can produce the important building blocks ofpeace.But ultimately  as in every conflict  the crucialdecisions must be made by the peoples of the Middle Eastthemselves. They must decide whether the region willcontinue to be an arena for terrorism and war or become afull participant in a peaceful  prosperous global economy.Cooperation and peace can give the Middle East a leadingposition in the world of the next millennium. Violence terrorism and war will assure stagnation and misery.Deep in our hearts  we know which choice we wantfor our children. My wife and I hope that when our twolittle boys grow up  the only competition they will engagein with Palestinian boys  and Egyptian boys  and Jordanianand Syrian and Lebanese boys  will be on football fieldsand in debating societies.It is characteristic of the Jewish people to live in hope.It is the name of our national anthem. It is what has madeit possible for us  despite unparalleled persecution  despitethe most horrific calamities to befall any people or anynation  clinging to hope  to contribute as much as we haveto human progress in the past 4 000 years. And this hope isreflected in the prayer we utter this week as we celebratethe Jewish new year. It is a wish we extend from oureternal capital Jerusalem  the city of peace  to all ourneighbours and to all present here today: “May the year andits maledictions end  and a new year and its blessingsbegin”. Shana tova — may you have a good year."
"83",3488,"ITA",53,1998,"I congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly  a sureguarantee of the success of the fifty-third session. At thesame time  I wish to thank your predecessor  Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  for his fine job in handling the difficult issuesthat arose last year.On the broader issues facing the General Assembly inthe year to come  Italy associates itself with and supportsthe statement made on Tuesday by the Foreign Minister ofAustria on behalf of the European Union.Fewer than 10 years have gone by since the euphoricdays that surrounded the fall of the Berlin Wall. As ourdecade began  “a new world order” was on everyone’s lips.Many believed that we were at the threshold of a new ageof stability  freedom and prosperity. In the ensuing years we have indeed witnessed rapid growth in the worldeconomy  but we have also seen an outbreak of new formsof nationalism  ethnic hostilities and acts of aggression.Our peoples have grown apprehensive about the futureas they watch the performance of the stock market  internalinstability in various regions of the world  the failure offinancial institutions  the rise and unpredictability ofterrorism  unchecked waves of immigration  the constantflow of refugees and the resurgence of misplaced nuclearambitions. In some countries  a few short months of crisiswas all it took to wipe out the gains of an entire generation.Such crises shed light on an improper balancebetween the power of the market and the power ofinstitutions. Globalization and liberalization certainly havegreat merits. They have forced the national politicalclasses to set public finances in order and to promoteeconomic efficiency. But a global market requires somemeasure of global government built on the knowledge thatthe wealth of single States cannot be separated from thewelfare of the international community  a governmentwhose strength rests on the democracy of institutions. AsSecretary-General Kofi Annan underlined in his speech globalization requires good government.This is why we urgently need to strengtheninternational leadership. The institutions are still notstrong enough to provide such leadership  restoreconfidence  introduce change  stabilize the globaleconomy  guarantee growth and protect the mostvulnerable of us in the race towards development.Technology  communications and the market areprogressing at a much faster pace than politics andinstitutions  thus creating a widening gap.In the final years of this century  our challenge is tostrengthen institutions and their capacity to coordinate theaction of Governments. Globalization has impacts onideologies and behaviour  societies and institutions. Theopening of markets to competition must be accompaniedby reaffirmed cooperation among the largest possiblenumber of States. The burden of responsibility falls onthe shoulders of the stronger nations  particularly those ofthe G-7. They have a duty to show solidarity transforming their privileges into benefits for allhumanity.The system of international institutions has theUnited Nations as its paramount and most authoritativebenchmark. The United Nations must be the driving forcebehind a review of the network of interdependence. Likeindustrialization in its early days  globalization producesboth great progress and dangerous imbalances. Thus  itrequires governance. No one country can govern it however great its political  economic and military power.Our century is drawing to a close with a revitalization ofinstitutions upon which we can build the three pillars ofstability: prosperity  security and respect for fundamentalfreedoms.The first pillar of stability is governance of theeconomy to prevent crises from degenerating intocatastrophes. The time has come to perfect the rules ofconduct that guide the development of the global market.19While these rules are imperfect and not always respected we must assert the conviction that it is important andappropriate to observe them. This is the secret of theirsuccess. It is up to the economically stronger countries toguarantee continuity in the development of the market.They must be buyers  lenders and the final guarantors if weare to instil confidence and forestall the threat of a globalrecession. The forces that drive the global economy are thesame as those that uphold the fundamental freedoms: thecirculation of information and ideas; open borders andsocieties; the rule of law and individual rights. Thechallenges facing the economy are the same as those facingfreedom.At times  the markets are driven by a short-term logicthat privileges the earnings of today over the growth oftomorrow. They conduct constant but instant referendums.The stock market does not always move at the same paceas the economy and society. Relentless technologicalprogress can lead to the exclusion of many from the worldof employment. Recent major economic and financial crisesshow that the market does not always grow when the Stateshrinks. Rather than enhancing freedom  sometimes it onlyincreases the power of the strongest. It is a dangerousillusion to think the economic sphere can be unhinged fromthe political system  the social context and the history ofnations. There can be no healthy economy without a strongState  without the rule of law  without social cohesivenessand protections — in other words  without respect forpeoples or awareness of their history.The market’s supporters should not turn into thestandard bearers for a new fundamentalism. Theinternational financial institutions must know how to coupletheory and practice  how to avoid strategies that damagesociety and destabilize the political system for the sake ofdefending the market. They must initiate policies andreforms that minimize moral hazards in their rescueoperations. They must look at society as a whole and notjust at its financial dimensions. Otherwise  some will rebelagainst or flee the market.The United Nations and the international communitycan rely on the new cohesiveness of the European Union.The European currency  the Euro  demands newresponsibilities at the international level as a repository ofvalue and as an investment and reserve currency. It willallow the Union to project abroad standards that it wouldnot otherwise be able to preserve  such as stability competition and social solidarity. The European Union hasno intention of hiding behind the shield of its currency. Ithas no illusions of being an oasis of prosperity shelteredfrom the tempests of the world.The politicians of Europe are the first to haverethought the limits of national sovereignty. Today  theEuropean Union  in the wake of the single currency  isabout to become a political subject  and to participate assuch in world leadership  to correct the fragility of thecomplex systems that govern the world. It is not enoughto have strong national powers. For the European Union too  the time has come to be a “leading nation”. The timehas come to further enhance the rules that have allowedus to unite the continent  banishing war within ourborders.To the South  Europe is facing massive waves ofimmigration. Europe is well aware of the needs that driveto its shores so many people trying to escape fromsuffocating demographic trends. Europe knows that theonly solution is an ambitious policy of solidarity anddevelopment. Otherwise  like King Canute  it would betrying to hold back the sea with a wave of its hand.Our cooperation policies must be revitalized to helpclose the gap between North and South. The Economicand Social Council  whose presidency will be assumed byItaly at the start of the coming year  can be instrumentalin eradicating poverty and harmonizing the differencesbetween and the needs of the two hemispheres.Renewed institutions will also have to manage thesecond pillar of stability: security. Here  too  the UnitedNations must play a central role. I refer not only to itstraditional role of direct involvement in peacekeepingoperations. Italy  I would underline  continues to providea strong logistic base  as well as men and resources  forsuch missions and has long proposed ways to make theseoperations more efficient and effective.I refer also to the novelty of the future: growingrelations with other institutions  including the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  to which thetransatlantic community entrusts its defence. The AtlanticAlliance is redefining its strategies  missions andmembership  but it is also rethinking its relations with theUnited Nations in a new spirit. It is looking to the UnitedNations for additional legitimacy to broaden the scope ofits mission. This is another crucial aspect of the system ofinstitutions that can guarantee peace and stability and onwhich we must build our future.20Peace is also jeopardized by resurgent temptations tobrandish nuclear weapons in an effort to restore regionalbalances  enhance national prestige and consolidate nationalunity. While such goals can be in themselves legitimate they become totally illusory if entrusted to the proliferationof weapons of mass destruction  instruments that threatenthe very right to life. In the framework of institutionalstrengthening  we must  as a matter of priority  root outsenseless ambitions that rely on lethal weapons. We mustaim instead to complete the non-proliferation regime andmake it more effective and more universal.Security is jeopardized by a breed of terrorism that hasbecome more and more irrational  threatening fragile peaceprocesses  privatizing terror and directing its hatred mostly but not exclusively  against the Western world and thevalues it represents. We must therefore redouble ourcommon efforts to fight this scourge.Individual rights are the third component ofinstitutional strengthening  along with prosperity andsecurity. The market and fundamental freedoms  as weincreasingly discover  are two sides of the same coin. Buthuman rights are likely to remain abstract or illusory if theUnited Nations cannot enforce them to the benefit of allindividuals and  if necessary  also against theirGovernments.The international community  and all of usindividually  must deepen our commitment to safeguardthese rights. The measure of our civilization is theprotection we afford to the weakest and most vulnerablesocial groups. I am thinking first of children who arevictims of atrocities whose true dimensions the media isonly now beginning to expose.The Rome Statute to establish the InternationalCriminal Court represents what is probably the greatestinstitutional advancement since the San Francisco Charter.In this field  on the fiftieth anniversary of the Declarationof Human Rights  it confers certainty and universality onthe Charter’s system of values. But here  too  we mustcomplete our journey. Therefore  I urge those countries thathave not yet done so — and they are the majority — tosign the Statute and to start to move towards promptratification.The core of every reform touches on the SecurityCouncil. It is not enough to strengthen institutions: we mustmake them more democratic and representative. And it ison the concepts of democracy and representation that thedebate over the future of the Security Council pivots.Significant progress has been made in recent monthsin identifying measures aimed at improving thetransparency and the working methods of the SecurityCouncil: greater openness of informal consultations; moreinvolvement of countries that contribute troops topeacekeeping operations and multilateral forces; moreprompt and detailed briefings on the Council’s activitiesby the President-in-office; and ready availability of textsand documents being examined by the Council.But the stalemate continues on the issue of enlargingthe Council. The Italian Government will be willing tosupport any reasonable formula  provided that it does notprejudice the eventual establishment of a commonEuropean seat on the Council  distance Italy from theother principal industrial countries or increase the numberof countries that are “more equal” than others transforming the majority of Member States fromprotagonists into mere spectators.The essential problem is one of principles andcriteria. Italy has made and will continue to make anactive contribution to this question that is of fundamentalimportance to international peace and stability. It willcontinue to fight for a more democratic  efficient andgeographically representative Security Council. No oneshould feel excluded. Every country  no matter how largeor small  has a contribution to make  an experience toshare.Given the current stalemate over increasing thenumber of permanent members  we wonder whether itwould not make more sense to concentrate for the timebeing only on an increase in non-permanent seats. Thesolution of increasing the number of elective seats forevery regional group would make it easier for all MemberStates to have access to the Security Council. After all this is the same solution that was adopted in 1963  whenthe only previous enlargement of the Council took place.As to the method we should follow to get there  webelieve that on a matter of such crucial importance it isessential that any decision with Charter amendmentimplications should be adopted by a majority of twothirds of all Member States  as prescribed by Article 108of the Charter.These are some of our suggestions for the “quietrevolution” of the United Nations  to which Secretary-General Kofi Annan has dedicated such passion. We aregrateful to him for his efforts.21The century that is about to end has taught that thereare no definitive and total solutions. Although theinstitutions are imperfect  they are flexible instruments. Itis our high duty to improve them so that they can becomethe visible hand of stability  together with the invisible handof the market. Institutions are the only truly indispensablepower."
"84",3534,"JAM",53,1998,"Let me begin by joiningprevious speakers in extending my personal congratulationsand those of my delegation to you  Sir  on your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession. You assume the leadership of this Assembly at atime when the global agenda demands much of us all. Iassure you of the full support and cooperation of theJamaican delegation as you guide the work of thisAssembly to what I am confident will be a successfulconclusion.I wish also to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko ofUkraine for the effective manner in which he dischargedhis responsibilities as President of the Assembly duringhis tenure.The Secretary-General deserves our praise for hisoutstanding leadership of the Organization during the pastyear. I congratulate him in particular on the successesachieved through the quiet methods of preventivediplomacy which he employed on sensitive issuesaffecting international peace and security.We welcome his report  which contains a thoughtfuloverview of the complex challenges facing theinternational community  and we applaud the institutionalreforms thus far introduced  which have sought to bringgreater coherence and efficiency to the work of theUnited Nations. We also endorse the reorganization of thework programme  which brings renewed focus to theinitiatives of central importance to the United Nations:those in the areas of peace and security  developmentcooperation  social development and humanitarian affairs.We consider it essential that the membership of theUnited Nations support the efforts of the Secretary-General in the implementation of this programme ofwork. Such support should be extended not only byendorsement of the range of activities being undertaken infulfilment of our mandates  but also through the regularcommitment of resources for their execution.Our presence here is an acknowledgement of theuniversality of many of the problems we face  and ourmembership in this Organization is a demonstration of ourconviction that these problems are best solved throughcollective action. This should lead us to reaffirm oursupport for multilateralism and our respect for itsprocesses through the timely payment  withoutpreconditions  of our assessed contributions to therespective United Nations bodies.In recent years  the international community haswitnessed a disturbing increase in the number of conflictswithin and between States. The stable peace anticipatedat the end of the cold war has been elusive. Instead  wehave watched as efforts to resolve ongoing regionaldisputes unravel because of obduracy  mistrust andhostility. We have watched as intolerance and hatred have3divided communities and fuelled conflicts across thecontinents. We are concerned that despite the interventionof the Secretary-General  his envoys and the membership ofthe United Nations  there is still no real progress towardspeace in a number of long-standing disputes.We share the international community’s concern thatthe peace process in the Middle East has been stalled  andwe are disappointed that there is still no substantial progresson the long-standing problem in Cyprus. Hostilities inAfghanistan continue unabated  civil wars still rage in theSudan and Angola and violence in Kosovo has escalated.New complications have arisen to increase instability andconflict in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa.These unresolved conflicts undermine the political economic and social fabric of the States concerned bringing destruction and untold human suffering to thevictims of war. We cannot afford to drift into complacencywhile increasing numbers of the world’s people aredestroyed  dispossessed and despoiled by war. In the faceof this  we should strengthen our resolve to stand againstaggression and the use of force  and to support theresolution of disputes and conflicts through negotiatedsettlements.We encourage Member States to support theSecretary-General’s initiative for strengthening thecapability of the United Nations to deal with conflictresolution  prevention and early warning. I also wish to usethis opportunity to commend the United Nationspeacekeeping forces for the great contribution which theycontinue to make to the maintenance of peace notwithstanding the difficult circumstances in which theywork.We are deeply distressed at the increasing acts ofviolence directed against international peacekeepingpersonnel. I wish to pay special tribute to these volunteers some of whom have given their lives  for their sacrifice inthe cause of peace.The Charter of the United Nations invests in theSecurity Council the principal authority for multilateraldecision-making in matters affecting international peace andsecurity. We are therefore concerned at the tendency ofStates to take unilateral action which they deem to be intheir national interest in situations of conflict with othernations. Jamaica reaffirms its confidence in the principle ofcollective security  on which the role of the SecurityCouncil is predicated.It is also important that the actions of the Councilinspire confidence and that there be greater openness andtransparency in its working methods. We believe that  likeany other international body  the Security Council shouldundergo a process of democratic reform if it is effectivelyto meet the new challenges of an ever changing world.We are committed to working as equal partners withthe rest of the international community to strengthen thecapacity of the Security Council to respond to the needsof Member States in matters of peace and security. Tothat end  my Government has presented its candidaturefor a non-permanent seat on the Council for the period2000-2001.My Government attaches importance to the fact thatthe long awaited International Criminal Court  which theSecretary-General described as the missing link in theinternational legal system  has now been constituted by aninternationally agreed Statute. We commend theGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago for taking theinitiative in calling for its establishment. That institutionwill provide a framework for the legal expression ofinternational opposition to the terrible crimes beingperpetrated against humanity which the United Nationshad not been able to address effectively.This year the international community celebrates thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights. As we commemorate this importantmilestone  we should affirm our commitment to the idealsof tolerance  peace and understanding for all peoples. Letus also demonstrate mutual respect for each other’s rightto self-determination  including the right to choose one’sown path for achieving national goals  and the right tosustainable development.There can be no doubt that peace and security areprerequisites for the attainment of sustainabledevelopment. It is equally true  however  that where thereis economic and social deprivation  there can be no realpeace.Jamaica therefore strongly endorses the right todevelopment as an integral part of fundamental humanrights and underscores the important contribution whichrealization of this right would make to the fullerenjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Inthis regard  we welcome the report of the Secretary-General on progress being made in the elaboration of astrategy for the implementation and promotion of the rightto development.4We continue to look to the United Nations system forsupport of our development agenda  which goes beyond oureffort to gain fair access to international markets and tosecure a just and equitable share of global prosperity.Central to improving the welfare of our people mustbe measures to alleviate and ultimately eradicate povertyand to promote environmental protection and sustainabledevelopment. We need to strengthen our institutionalframework for capacity-building and we need to invest indevelopment of our human resources.This is our people-centred vision for development  andwe recognize the need  if we are to make a reality of thisvision  to continue to devise and implement public policieswhich ensure that the gains from economic growth anddevelopment are equitably distributed throughout society.This challenge of good governance demands aninstitutional infrastructure that promotes transparency andaccountability in public administration  ensures the effectivemanagement of fiscal and monetary policies and protectsthe integrity of judicial and law enforcement systems.A crucial component of our economic and socialtransformation is the development of our human resources.Jamaica supports the view that sustainable developmentcannot be achieved without sustained human development.Indeed  the pivotal importance of our human resources tothe development process was reaffirmed by the CaribbeanCommunity member States in the Montego Bay Declarationadopted in 1997.We in the Caribbean region stand firmly committed to first  nurturingthe development of each person’s potentialwithout regard to gender; secondly  developing a culture ofentrepreneurship; thirdly  research and development as away of life and a means of improving production; andfinally  improving the competitiveness of those industrieson which our economies are based. We look to theinternational community to support these aspirations.In this regard  Jamaica welcomes the Secretary-General’s proposed initiatives to strengthen the internationalframework for human development. We agree that it wouldbe useful to convene global and regional seminars exploringways to advance human resource development andinstitution-building in preparation for the MillenniumAssembly to be held in the year 2000.The issue of sustainable development for small islanddeveloping States is of particular importance to Jamaica. Itspeaks to the very survival of a group of island Stateswhose economic viability and developmental aspirationsare inextricably linked to the carrying capacity of thefragile ecosystems in which these nations make theirhome. I speak of the ecologically vulnerable islands andlow-lying coastal States of the Caribbean  which arecontinually subject to the pressures of urbanization andresource exploitation  to the pollution of their coastalwaters and to the threat of natural disasters. We areendangered by the threat of sea-level rise and face thedestruction of our coral reefs.The danger posed by natural disasters was mostrecently demonstrated by hurricane Georges  whichwreaked destruction through the Caribbean  causingwidespread loss of life and property in Antigua andBarbuda  Cuba  Dominica  the Dominican Republic  Haitiand Saint Kitts and Nevis. We take this opportunity toappeal to the international community to provide urgentand generous humanitarian assistance and support for thereconstruction of our sister Caribbean States. Jamaicawelcomes the ongoing effort of the United Nations todevelop economic and ecological vulnerability indices forsmall island developing States and will be monitoringclosely the outcome of this work.The success of the small island developing Statesinitiative will depend on the negotiation of favourableagreements among national stakeholders and on theforging of effective partnerships with donor countries.Jamaica therefore looks forward to the convening of thespecial session for the review of the Global Conferenceon the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States in 1999  which provides an opportunityfor real progress to be made through the commitment offinancial resources. What we need now is an action-oriented follow-up programme to take our economies intothe twenty-first century.Jamaica is a strong advocate of multilateralism andbelieves that measures available within the multilateralframework should be employed to assist developingcountries to benefit meaningfully from the process ofglobalization. We note that while this process holds muchpromise for growth and prosperity  it also poses seriouschallenges for developing countries  many of which arebeing increasingly marginalized. The reality is that theglobalization process is heightening patterns of unevendevelopment among developed and developing countries and it is already very clear that there is no globalizationof benefits.5The plight of developing countries in the wake of thefinancial crisis currently affecting the global economy ismade even grimmer when we take into account the declinein concessionary financial flows from the donor communitywhich we have witnessed in recent years. Officialdevelopment assistance represents today only an average of0.22 per cent of the gross national product of developedcountries  a far cry from the target of 0.7 per cent set in1972. The share of official development assistance in netresource flows to developing countries fell from 64 per centin 1994 to 22 per cent in 1996.Taken with the heavy burden of the debt-servicepayments which must be met  we are faced with theunhappy circumstance of net reverse flows from the Southto the North at a time when additional resources are neededto address the challenges which attend the globalizationprocess.These trends must be reversed if developing countriesare to have a fair opportunity to achieve meaningfuldevelopment; for the success of the development process isdependent on the availability of external financing  andconcessionary resource flows play a significant role in themaintenance of economic stability  the development ofinfrastructure and capacity-building  which are prerequisitesfor effective participation in the globalization process.Jamaica considers that the time has come for us toaddress these issues in serious dialogue. There is an urgentneed to identify ways in which development financing fromindustrialized to developing and transition economies forboth public and private sector enterprise may be increased.We must explore measures to relieve the external debt ofthe developing countries  including the cancellation of debt.We should seek to have dialogues between creditor anddebtor countries to ensure an increase in the flow ofconcessionary financing in support of economic reforms poverty eradication and the achievement of sustainabledevelopment.We therefore join the call for the urgent convening ofa conference on financing for development at an early date.Crucial issues which we would wish to see discussed atsuch a meeting are strategies for mobilizing domesticresources for development; mobilization of internationalprivate financial flows; international financial cooperationfor development; debt relief; and trade facilitation fordevelopment.Beyond this proposed conference  my Governmentrecognizes that there is a need for ongoing exchangebetween the North and the South. While the days of theideological divide and political polarization are behind us we are still faced with the challenge of North-Southdisparity in development and opportunity. We need tofoster increased collaboration between the developed andthe developing world to identify ways in which widercooperation on issues concerning trade and investment debt and development may be pursued.We consider that a process of dialogue on theseissues could be initiated by a representative group ofdeveloping and transition economies in consultation withthe major industrialized countries. We believe that sucha process of dialogue would pave the way for a broaderframework of functional cooperation in areas of interestto both North and South.It is with much satisfaction that Jamaica assumes thechairmanship of the Group of 15 developing States  andwe look forward to hosting the ninth ministerial meetingin Jamaica in February next year. Jamaica  during itstenure  will seek to ensure that developing countries playa more active role in shaping the international economyso as to promote greater balance and equity.My Government remains deeply concerned at theever expanding illicit drug trade  which is not only amenace to civil society  but also undermines the economicviability of our countries. The extraordinary demand forand supply of illicit drugs for this lucrative trade hasresulted in the formation of transnational networks including highly sophisticated money-launderingoperations. Of even greater concern is the now well-established link between the drug trade and theproliferation of small arms. The ready availability ofsmall arms has intensified the cycle of crime and violencein our societies.The special session of the General Assembly on theworld drug problem  held earlier this year  underscoredthe need to strengthen the process of bilateral  regionaland international cooperation in the fight against illicitdrug activities. These initiatives should also dealsimultaneously with the related problem of small arms.Jamaica calls on the international community to fullysupport these efforts.Jamaica joins in condemning the acts of terrorismcommitted in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi during August.We support the adoption of a multilateral approach as themost effective means of removing this threat to thesecurity of the international community.6Caribbean States recognize the ocean as a symbol ofthe common heritage of mankind  a vital resource whichshould be managed in a responsible manner so as to ensureits continued use for present and future generations.Caribbean Governments are committed to the protection ofthe Caribbean Sea  our shared patrimony. We have recentlytaken a decision to develop and implement a comprehensivecoastal zone management programme by the year 2000. Wecontinue to be concerned at the threat tothe fragile marineenvironment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear andother hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea.Jamaica commends the Government of Portugal for itsinitiative in establishing the Independent WorldCommission on the Oceans  on which an eminent Jamaicanserves. As part of its recognition of the International Yearof the Ocean  the Government of Jamaica has establisheda National Council on Ocean and Coastal ZoneManagement to promote the sustainable development anduse of our marine resources.The International Seabed Authority  which has itsheadquarters in Kingston  continues to make progress onthe negotiation of a mining code. It is hoped that thesenegotiations will be finalized at an early date  so that aregulatory regime for the resources of the seabed may befirmly established. We call on Member States to participatemore actively in these negotiations in order to ensure thatthe code which is developed will protect the interests of allcountries. We also urge Member States to support theoperation of the Authority through the commitment ofresources.It has not escaped our attention that many of thepreceding speakers have made reference to the need for thepromotion of international peace  human security andsustainable development. As we move forward towards theend of an era  we must redouble our efforts to ensure thatwe do not face the dawn of the new millennium burdenedby the weight of unresolved issues which impede thedevelopment of our community of nations and whichundermine the well-being of our peoples.Clearly  it is in our individual and collective interestto participate fully in the process for development andpeace  for  after all  the character of the global village ofthe future will ultimately be determined by the quality ofthe input that each of us invests today."
"85",3580,"JOR",53,1998,"Allow me  at the outset  to congratulate you and theGovernment and people of Uruguay on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession. I would also like to take this opportunity toexpress my deep appreciation and gratitude to yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  forhis successful and distinguished management of the lastsession.I would be remiss if I failed to pay tribute as well tothe Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his efforts to promote the authority of thisOrganization and achieve its noble aims and objectivesand those of its Charter. I note in particular his report onthe work of the Organization  and I emphasize that hemay count on the full support and cooperation of mydelegation in his efforts to establish peace and security inthe world.Jordan has always believed in the noble aims andobjectives of the Charter of the United Nations. We havemade every possible effort to maintain international peaceand security  particularly in the Middle East  a volatileregion whose peoples have  for over half a century suffered from the scourge of war and from conflicts anddisturbances and who have lived under difficultcircumstances characterized by confrontation andpolarization. Jordan  under the leadership of His MajestyKing Hussein Ibn Talal  has always been an oasis ofsecurity and stability. It has always raised the voice ofreason and moderation and as a result has had to shoulderheavy burdens that have exhausted its natural  financialand economic resources and placed an additional strain onits development process.Throughout the past decades  Jordan has madecontinuous efforts to achieve a peaceful and honourablesettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It continues tostrive towards that goal by upholding the peace treatywhich it reached with Israel within the framework of theMadrid Conference  and it continues to support efforts toreach an agreement on the Palestinian  Israeli and othertracks.However  the peace process remains deadlocked despite the efforts to move it forward  including theinitiative being made by the United States on thePalestinian track. As we recognize the centrality of thePalestinian track as regards the peace process  we valuethe positive stand taken by the Palestinian leadership andits sincere desire to reach an agreement that would end5the deadlock on this track and result in the full and clearacceptance of this initiative.We therefore demand that the Israeli Governmentdeclare its full acceptance of the United States initiative carry out its commitment under the agreements and removeall obstacles to reaching an agreement on redeployment andother outstanding issues. This would make it possible toachieve real progress on this track with a view to endingthe deadlock  resuming and attaining the objectives of thepeace process and ensuring the legitimate national rights ofthe Palestinian people  including the right to establish theirindependent State on their national territory.Citing security considerations as pretexts forobstructing actual progress will further undermine thesecurity of every party in the region. Security cannot beenhanced except through a just and honourable peace  onewhich is convincing to the peoples of the region and onewhich they can defend.The occupied city of Jerusalem has been the mostimportant component of the Arab-Israeli conflict throughoutits various stages. It is part of the Arab territories occupiedin 1967. Therefore  any consideration that apply to thoseterritories also apply to Jerusalem  in particular SecurityCouncil resolution 242 (1967).We call upon Israel to cease and void all actions thatwould change the status of the Holy City. Under the Osloaccords concluded between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization  it was agreed that the final statusof the city was to be decided in final status negotiations.Any unilateral actions taken before the conclusion of thosenegotiations would constitute a violation of the Osloaccords and of all resolutions of international legitimacy.Until the status of the city is finally decided  it shouldremain open to all adherents of the three divine monotheistic religions. Jordan has for many years assumedresponsibility for maintaining the sanctity of the city ofJerusalem and has also taken it upon itself  under thecircumstances of the occupation  to take care of andpreserve the Holy Places.On the other hand  Israel should desist from allunilateral actions against the Palestinian people  such asclosures  sieges  arrests  the demolition of homes  theconfiscation of land and the building of settlements in theoccupied Palestinian territory  including Jerusalem. Israelmust lift the restrictions that hinder the development of thePalestinian economy and enable the Palestinian people tostart establishing normal economic relations with theoutside world  free from domination and from economiccontrol. It must also deal with the Palestinian people asits partners in the peace process  partners who are lookingforward to living side by side with Israel on the basis ofgood neighbourliness and equality  not as a people underoccupation.With regard to negotiations on the other tracks Israel must prove its seriousness about resumingnegotiations with Syria and Lebanon from the point atwhich they ended  ensuring its withdrawal from theSyrian Arab Golan to the borders of 4 June 1967 implementing Security Council resolution 425 (1978) byunconditionally withdrawing from southern Lebanon andreaching peace agreements with both of them  on the roadtowards achieving a comprehensive peace in the region.Five decades have passed since the tragedy of thePalestinian refugees began. The United Nations Relief andWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East(UNRWA) continues to carry out its duties towards thePalestinian refugees — a recognition by the internationalcommunity of its responsibility with regard to thistragedy. However  in recent years UNRWA has beensuffering from severe financial crises  which sometimesthreaten to suspend or put an end to its services and thecompletion of its work. We would therefore like toemphasize once again that Jordan attaches the utmostimportance to the continuation of UNRWA?s work especially given the fact that Jordan hosts the largestnumber of Palestinian refugees and provides services tothem above and beyond the budget of UNRWA.Jordan has consistently called for UNRWA tocontinue its work until the refugee problem is completelyresolved through the return of refugees to their land andhomes and/or their compensation in accordance withGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III). The expiry of thefive-year transitional period under the Oslo accords doesnot mean that UNRWA?s mission is over or that there isno longer any need for it to exist. The basic condition forthe end of UNRWA?s mission is an agreement on a finalsolution to the refugee problem and on the full andcomplete implementation of that agreement.We understand the continued existence of UNRWAand its work from three perspectives: the human  thepolitical and the legal. To ignore any of them wouldprejudice international responsibility for the tragedy of therefugees  who have been displaced from their homes. Wetherefore appeal to the donor countries to continue tomake contributions to UNRWA  increasing them as much6as possible in proportion to the natural increase in thenumbers of refugees and the need to satisfy their basichumanitarian needs. We also appeal to all financially ableStates to provide the necessary financial support toUNRWA.We draw your attention to the fact that were UNRWAto stop providing services to refugees  this would in itselfconstitute an additional obstacle to the peace process  inaddition to destabilizing the region through the frustrationcaused by increased poverty among the refugees and thedeterioration of their economic situation.It is indeed sad that while the world celebrates thefiftieth anniversary of the signing of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights we still talk about thedeteriorating situation of the Palestinian refugees and theirhuman basic rights. On this occasion  we are called upon towork for increased commitments to respect and to find aneffective international mechanism to implementinternational instruments relative to human rights  awayfrom selectivity and double standards. We are also calledupon to establish a balance between these internationalinstruments  on the one hand  and the national systems andlaws in force in various countries of the world  withoutprejudice to the principle of State sovereignty  on the other.We therefore feel that we should recall the appeal madefrom this rostrum by His Royal Highness Crown Prince El-Hassan for the establishment of a new internationalhumanitarian order. In this spirit  my country participatedand supported the adoption of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court in Rome earlier this year.Cooperation and coexistence among different religiousand ethnic groups requires a formula for dialogue amongcivilizations and religions to replace the concepts of conflictand fear of foreigners which has emerged recently.Dialogue among religions will highlight the commondenominators among the different beliefs of the world?speoples and would explain their foundations to the otherparties  thereby making it easier to understand and tocoexist with one another.The desired inter-religious dialogue is the best way toconfront the incipient manifestations of animosity and theattempts to distort the image of Islam and Muslims whether those living in their home countries or those whohave emigrated to non-Muslim countries. It is necessary tohave a deeper understanding of Islam and the Muslims away from the blind bigotry which leads to unfairgeneralizations about  and the stereotyping of  over onebillion Muslims. From that narrow view  bigotry leads toanimosity towards Islam and the Muslims on the basis ofactions committed by a minority which is farthestremoved from Muslims and the tolerant concepts ofIslam.The question of human rights leads us to mentionthe continued suffering of the Iraqi people over the pasteight years as a result of economic sanctions. While wecall upon the Government of Iraq to fully andmeticulously comply with all Security Council resolutions to cooperate fully and constructively with the UnitedNations towards that end and to commit itself torepatriating Kuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons we call upon the international community to relieve thesuffering of the Iraqi people. We also emphasize theindependence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of bothIraq and Kuwait.Other peoples in the region  like the Libyan andSudanese peoples  have suffered and continue to sufferfrom sanctions. Others who were not targeted bysanctions have also suffered from the impact of thesesanctions. My country  Jordan  was the first to suffertremendous damage to its economy as a result of thesanctions imposed on Iraq. Nevertheless  we have notonly patiently persevered; we have made our best effortsto abide by Security Council resolutions out of respect forinternational legitimacy.Weapons of mass destruction constitute a dangeroussource of tension and instability. The Middle East regionhas been afflicted with the existence of these weapons.Perhaps the ideal solution to dispose of weapons of massdestruction and to end the tension and instability causedby their presence is by concluding international treatiesestablishing zones free from nuclear weapons and otherweapons of mass destruction in various regions of theworld  including the Middle East.We view with utmost concern nuclear tests carriedout recently in South-East Asia in the context of an armsrace which  if continued  would have extremely dangerousconsequences. A majority of the world?s countries havefor a long time committed themselves to internationalguarantees that would prevent the proliferation and use ofnuclear weapons. It is very unfortunate that some woulddepart from this moral commitment which had previouslyprevented them from falling into the trap of a vainnuclear arms race in that region. In this regard  we callupon all countries that have not yet done so to accede tothe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) inorder to safeguard international peace and security and7contribute to the attainment of the goal of general andcomplete disarmament. This would enable humanity to riditself of the terror of nuclear weapons and other weaponsof mass destruction.We view with particular sensitivity the threat posed byweapons of mass destruction. Israel possesses and isdeveloping a nuclear-weapons arsenal. The possibility of aconfrontation between it and other States that have suchweapons or other weapons of mass destruction  such aschemical and biological weapons  makes us live under thethreat of these weapons and the dangers of their use at anymoment. Therefore we demand that a regional securitymechanism be established and that a forum be establishedto discuss this matter in a way that would ensure theremoval of this threat. In this context  there is a need toestablish conflict-resolution and conflict-prediction centresin the region to anticipate such disputes before they occurand to prevent them from happening and escalating.The comprehensive concept of security — a conceptthat is in conformity with the new developments andconcepts that have matured recently  particularly after theend of the cold war and the disappearance of the policy ofpolarization — has become a wide concept that carrieswithin it all concerns and problems — economic  social political and humanitarian. These problems may lead to themarginalization and frustration of large sectors of societythat would in turn sow the seeds of instability anddisturbances which lead to the escalation of existingdisputes and the creation of new ones. It would also lead tothe growth and spread of terror to a disturbing extent.Jordan has for so long called for the rooting out of thescourge of terrorism by eliminating its causes and byestablishing justice and political solutions  accepted andpreserved by peoples. We have also called for confrontingterrorism with all the firmness needed and for the concertedand systematic international action required under theumbrella of the United Nations  guided by its Charter  tofind appropriate and effective mechanisms to combatterrorism.We therefore condemn the two terrorist attacks inNairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. We also condemn moststrongly terrorist acts of all kinds and forms wherever theyoriginate. In this context  it is worth noting the ceaselessefforts made by the Organization of the Islamic Conference as emphasized at its Twelfth Summit Conference  held atTehran in December 1997  to establish a code of conductthat would unify State views on terrorism and action bythese States to combat and eradicate it.The General Assembly is meeting while the worldwitnesses conflicts and struggles in various regions likethe Balkans  Asia and Africa. In Kosovo  massacres arestill being committed against innocent civilians despite therecent Security Council resolution on that question. InAfghanistan  the Congo and other places  fightingcontinues despite international efforts to stop thebloodshed and find solutions within the framework of theCharter and the principles of international law.Peacekeeping operations are among the mostimportant activities undertaken by our Organization forthe promotion of world peace  security and stability.Jordan has always believed in the noble goals of theseactivities and for several years has participated in them.The world has made important steps towards thedisposal of anti-personnel landmines  which every yearkill thousands of innocent people and leave thousandsmore with permanent disabilities  preventing them fromexercising their natural right to life. In recognition of theimportance of the Convention banning anti-personnelmines  Jordan has decided to accede to it. Her MajestyQueen Noor has sponsored the international effort to ridhumanity of this dangerous threat  thereby embodyingJordan?s belief in the humanitarian dimensions and thenoble goals of the Convention.During the past few years we have witnesseddevelopments that have left a deep impact on the worldeconomy  including the transition to a market economy the removal of economic barriers and the trend towardsa globalized economy. Such developments place burdenson developing countries and their economies. Thisrequires finding the necessary means to avoid the negativeimpact of these developments on these countries and tohelp them adapt their economies to the changes andprepare them to join the World Trade Organization(WTO).Among these modalities is a commitment by wealthycountries to increase official development assistance  tofind comprehensive solutions to the problem of externaldebt  to integrate developing countries into the world free-trade system  and to improve terms of trade.As a developing country  Jordan has suffered fromeconomic problems  which grew worse following the Gulfwar of the early 1990s. With the help of the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF)  Jordan has pursued structuraladjustment policies that have resulted in tangible progress.Jordan has succeeded in reducing its budget deficit and8the size of its external debt. It has improved itsmacroeconomic indicators  reformed financial regulations inits banking sector and energized the role of the privatesector. Yet we still face a difficult economic situationowing to regional conditions and to the impact on oureconomy of the crisis in countries of South-East Asia  withmany of which we maintain close economic ties. Ourexports to those countries have been adversely affected bythe crisis.Improving the economic situation in our regionrequires the removal of barriers and restrictions thatobstruct the flow of goods and services among the countriesof the region  and cooperation among those countries inconfronting the economic and environmental challengesbefore us. We are all aware that the problems andchallenges we are confronting are increasing in scope andin complexity; most of them defy individual or immediatesolution. We need increased cooperation to deal with themon the basis of the interdependence and interrelationship ofevents throughout the world.We live in one world  a world in which distances areshrinking and barriers disappearing. For internationalcooperation in the interest of humanity to be sustainable we must all avoid confrontation and abide by internationallaw. No State should be above the law. We must thereforefoster democracy in the international system; that systemshould be free of hegemony and inequality. The UnitedNations should be viewed as the framework of thatcooperation; this would build smaller States? confidence injustice.As we stand on the threshold of the third millennium we hope that dialogue among peoples and civilizations willbe strengthened. We hope that attitudes and actions will bedefined by the fact that what we do today will affect futuregenerations. Our concern for future generations obliges usto create conditions that are better than those of the past.We can do this only with mutual understanding andcoexistence  and only with the political will to create abetter world. We are confident that future generationsdeserve that from us  and we are confident that we canprovide it."
"86",3627,"JPN",53,1998,"I should like toextend my most sincere compliments to you  Sir  ForeignMinister of Uruguay  on your assumption of office asPresident of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.I should also like to express my respects to Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  Deputy of the Supreme Rada of Ukraine  for allhis efforts during his tenure as President of the fifty-secondsession of the General Assembly.How should we build the framework for a newinternational order in the twenty-first century? This is thequestion that our international community is facing amidstnew situations that were created in the aftermath of thecollapse of the cold war  almost a decade ago. Thatcollapse provided an opportunity to establish a harmoniousorder based upon the cooperation of the entire internationalcommunity  rather than the maintenance of peace by amilitary balance between two super-Powers. However  ourinternational community today is troubled with frequentregional conflicts and challenged by the inseparablyconnected problem of poverty. Creating a new system tocope effectively with such challenges is the greatest agendafor our international community today. To achieve thisobjective  we must simultaneously promote three issues:peace and development  which are two sides of the samecoin  plus United Nations reforms  which are indispensablein our efforts to achieve the first two.Today  the possibility of a world-wide conflict hasdecreased in comparison to the cold-war era  but conflictsarising from such causes as ethnic and religiousconfrontation are increasing. In dealing with theseconflicts  it is more important to focus on how to preventthem rather than on how to solve them once they breakout. In this regard  we must first consider the essentialissues of arms control and disarmament. The recentnuclear tests of India and Pakistan constitute enormouschallenges to the non-proliferation regime. We urgentlyneed to find a way to prevent the proliferation of nuclearweapons and other weapons of mass destruction  and tostrengthen the non-proliferation regime. Furthermore  it isnecessary to deal not only with the weapons of massdestruction  such as nuclear  biological and chemicalweapons  but also with such conventional weapons assmall arms and anti-personnel landmines.Social instabilities lie at the root of conflicts. Thismakes it extremely important to deal with developmentissues. There are also growing global threats  such asenvironmental destruction and terrorism. The crueldestructive power of terrorism especially threatens thelives and safety of citizens. It is different by nature fromconventional armed conflict between nations  but in thepost-cold-war world it poses increasingly grave concernsto our security. Our international community shouldseriously consider ways to effectively cope with theseproblems and threats.Today  based on such thinking  I should like todiscuss these issues from the perspectives of peace anddevelopment and of reform  which is indispensable inpromoting the first two. In so doing  I want to elaborateon our thinking and express our determination to play aleading role in fulfilling our responsibilities.I should first like to talk about nuclear non-proliferation  arms control and disarmament  which areessential to maintaining peace. In May this year  Indiaand Pakistan conducted  to our deepest regret  a series ofnuclear tests  which are formidable challenges to thenuclear non-proliferation regime. In seeking a world freeof nuclear weapons  it is indispensable that we allow nofurther proliferation and secure a solid basis for thenuclear non-proliferation regime. The existing formatcertainly is not perfect  but there is no feasible  realisticalternative if we are to ensure stability in our internationalcommunity. No country should be allowed to attempt toset back international efforts towards strengthening thenon-proliferation regime. At the same time  to improvethe effectiveness of this regime  it is important  togetherwith the efforts by all nations to maintain non-proliferation  to see sincere implementation of nuclear16disarmament by nuclear-weapon States. Based on thisthinking  we regard the following five points as important.First  the nuclear non-proliferation regime shouldbecome more universal. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) sets the structurefor international control of nuclear weapons  with noalternative  and we strongly urge non-parties to accede tothis Treaty promptly and without condition. In this context we highly appreciate Brazilâs accession to the NPT inAugust this year.Secondly  in order to complement the NPT and ensurenuclear non-proliferation  I should like to underline theneed to place strict export controls on equipment  materialsand technologies that relate to nuclear weapons andmissiles. We urge every nation to engage in serious effortsto prevent any transfer of such materials and technologies.Thirdly  we must prevent any further nuclear testing.Without universal support for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  the effectiveness of the nuclearnon-proliferation system cannot be maintained. I should liketo call on nations that have not yet done so to promptlybecome parties to this Treaty so as to realize its earlyeffectuation. In the meantime  we should take necessarysteps to assure the cessation of nuclear testing.Fourthly  further advancement of nuclear disarmamentby nuclear-weapon States is more important than ever inmaintaining and strengthening various efforts for nuclearnon-proliferation. We hope to see early effectuation ofSTART II and an early launching of negotiations onSTART III. Also  we welcome such actions as the decisionby the British Government in July this year for a significantreduction of their nuclear arsenals  as well as Franceâsdecision to dismantle its ground-to-ground missiles. Weurge all the nuclear-weapon States to implement sincerelytheir obligations under article 6 of the NPT  therebypromoting nuclear disarmament even further.Fifthly  to put a cap on nuclear-weapons capability each nation must positively participate in and reach an earlyconclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-offtreaty.During this session of the General Assembly  Japanwill take initiatives to promote these five objectives.Needless to say  the promotion of arms control anddisarmament should not be limited to the area of nuclearweapons. Dealing with other weapons of mass destruction such as biological and chemical weapons  as well asdelivery vehicles  such as missiles  is of high importance.The recent missile launch by North Korea  even if it wasan attempt to launch a satellite into orbit  poses a seriousproblem which directly concerns both Japanâs nationalsecurity and peace and stability in North-East Asia. It alsoconstitutes a challenge to our efforts to prevent theproliferation of delivery vehicles of weapons of massdestruction. I renew my call for North Korea to considerseriously the 15 September statement by the President ofthe Security Council as a message reflecting the views ofthe entire international community  and to never repeatsuch an act.Furthermore  to prevent the outbreak and escalationof conflicts  we also need to address the problems of anti-personnel landmines and small arms  including automaticrifles  regarding which we have yet to make sufficientefforts. We intend to continue to play a leading role onthese issues. In particular  in the area of anti-personnellandmines we will endeavour to strengthen internationalcooperation towards early realization of the â€œzero victimâ€objective  by supporting assistance for victims and theelimination of landmines. We are pleased that 40countries have now ratified the Convention banning anti-personnel landmines and that it will enter into force on 1March next year. We are now making efforts for Japanâsearliest possible ratification of this Convention. We askother nations yet to ratify it to do so promptly  so that itmay become a universal framework to ban anti-personnellandmines totally.Conflicts give rise to intolerable crimes againsthumanity  such as genocide. To deter such crimes  it isnecessary to establish a permanent international court thatpunishes such acts as international crimes. Adoption ofthe agreement in July this year in Rome to establish sucha court was an act of historic significance. Japan believesthat the blessing and cooperation of the entireinternational community is indispensable if the court is toproduce effective results. That is why we took importantinitiatives at the Diplomatic Conference. It is our hopethat the International Criminal Court will continue togrow and become a universal framework.In our efforts towards peace  with civilian staffassuming an increasing role in United Nations activities including peacekeeping  we observe with regret anincreasing number of cases where non-combatants becomethe targets of violence by belligerents. In July this year a staff member from Japan  together with staff membersfrom Poland  Tajikistan and Uruguay  fell victim to a17despicable criminal act directed at the United NationsMission of Observers in Tajikistan. The countries concernedand the United Nations need to seriously examine ways toensure the security of United Nations personnel and ofrelevant humanitarian-assistance organizations. In thisregard  we reiterate our call upon nations that have not yetdone so to join the Convention on the Safety of UnitedNations and Associated Personnel  adopted in December1994  so that it may come into force as soon as possible. Atthe same time  Japan will also make contributions of about$1 million to the United Nations to support securitymeasures for United Nations personnel. We hope manyother countries will also make contributions to supportUnited Nations efforts in this field.Some of the basic causes of conflicts are problems ofeconomic and social development. We must pay closeattention to them. During the Tokyo InternationalConference on Preventive Strategy  which Japan hosted thisJanuary  participants underlined the importance of acomprehensive approach in dealing with such problems bycoming to grips with various causes of them  includingpoverty.The development issue is the greatest challenge theworld will face in the twenty-first century. In addressingthis issue  we have to deal not only with the economic-development problems of the developing countries  but alsowith the social sides of development  such as human rightsand good governance.Japan has been advocating a new development strategythat contains such ideas. We are pleased that the conceptwas endorsed in 1996 at the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development and has been gaining supportin the United Nations. This strategy is based on thephilosophy that the international community should makeno distinction between donor countries and recipientcountries and should tackle the problems of development asa common issue for all. In this regard  this strategy attachesgreat importance to developing countriesâ playing an activeand responsible role in their own development. It alsoemphasizes positive cooperation based on partnershipwithout distinction between developing and developedcountries. These are the guiding principles of the newdevelopment strategy.On the basis of these principles  the Second TokyoInternational Conference on African Development(TICAD II) will be held in Japan this October as a follow-up to the first Conference  held in 1993. Its objective is toseek a path to promote the new development strategy inAfrica so as to support African countriesâ own nation-building efforts. In this regard  we aim to draw up anagenda for action.Japan also has been making the greatestcontributions possible to the stable development of Asia.In the present financial and economic crisis we havetaken initiatives to implement measures of supporttotalling about $43 billion to Asian countries  which is thelargest single contribution by any nation in the world.Simultaneously  Japan is making every possible effort through such measures as stabilizing our financial system to put our own economy on a recovery track within thenext year or two. We believe that the early recovery ofour own economy is the best contribution we can make tothe economies of Asia and of the world. We hopestrongly that the coming conference  TICAD II  willbenefit from such Asian experiences and provide a goodopportunity to use the wisdom and power of the entireinternational community to assist the development of theAfrican continent.In the post-cold-war transformation of internationalrelations  Japan is actively promoting what we callEurasian diplomacy. This means redefining relations withcountries of the Eurasian continent  including the RussianFederation  the Peopleâs Republic of China  the Republicof Korea and countries in the Silk Road regions ofCentral Asia and the Caucasus range. This is anotherexample of Japanâs policy of promoting peace anddevelopment in tandem.In todayâs world  problems that directly threatenpeopleâs daily lives across national borders are becomingincreasingly serious. These include environmentaldestruction  overpopulation  human rights violations  theexodus of refugees  terrorism  drug-trafficking international organized crime and global diseases such asAIDS. To cope with these problems  our internationalcommunity must be united under the concept ofprotecting the security and dignity of mankind fromglobal threats. Furthermore  citizens  along withGovernments  must get together to engage in commonundertakings  such as making common rules. In particular as we mark the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  I should like topoint out that efforts against large-scale human rightsviolations and efforts to ease refugee problems arisingfrom conflicts are also indispensable for preventingconflicts.18In addressing issues of peace and development  thereis an urgent need to reform the United Nations and tostrengthen its functions. Peace and development are twosides of the same coin. At the same time  if the UnitedNations is to respond effectively to various problems thatour international community shoulders  we urgently need todo our best to assure a healthy financial basis. This includeseach Member Stateâs sincere implementation of itsobligation to pay its assessed contribution. Japanâsassessment will be over 20 per cent  exceeding the sum ofthat of four permanent members of the Security Council not including the United States. In this situation  reform inthe financial area requires serious attention. In reformingthe United Nations to strengthen its functioning  we mustpromote reforms in three interrelated areas in a balancedmanner: reform in the political area  the development area and the financial area  which supports political anddevelopment activities.It is regrettable that even though the chances ofmaterializing reforms increased during last yearâs GeneralAssembly session  discussions on the reform of the SecurityCouncil have not developed since then. Under thecircumstances facing the international community Imentioned earlier  reforming the Security Council toreinforce its legitimacy and effectiveness is an urgent task.Japan  with the endorsement of many countries  is preparedto assume greater responsibilities as a permanent memberof the Security Council. This would be in accordance withour basic philosophy of non-resort to the use of forceprohibited by our Constitution. We are now in the fifth yearsince the concrete discussions on the reform of the SecurityCouncil started. Points of argument have been exhausted.We are now at a stage where each country should make apolitical decision. Japan believes that we are able to agreeon a package that responds to the interests of the entireinternational community and to the legitimate concerns ofthe majority of countries. If we do not have the will todecide and act in order to achieve an agreement on such apackage  we will not be able to respond effectively tochallenges the international community will face in thecoming century. Japan strongly urges all countries to makea bold political decision for the strengthening of the UnitedNations so that we may reach an agreement on theframework of the reform during the present session of theGeneral Assembly.The twenty-first century is just around the corner. It isour duty to preserve and develop the heritage of mankindin the coming century. The late professor  Mr. YutakaAkino  who gave his life during his mission ofpeacekeeping in Tajikistan  was one of my close friends.He had the following motto: do not be pushed around byevents; take action. Along the same lines  the UnitedNations should make action a top priority and become astrong Organization equipped with both effectiveness andcredibility  squarely tackling all problems. We theMember States should make utmost efforts to achieve it so that the United Nations can enter the twenty-firstcentury as such an Organization. The future of the UnitedNations is in the hands of the Member States. My guidingprinciple in Japanâs policy management is to be sincere to be steady and to be courageously prompt. I thereforeshould like to conclude my remarks by emphasizing myresolution to take leadership in addressing issues of peace development and reform in a sincere  steady andcourageously prompt manner."
"87",3652,"KAZ",53,1998,"Allow me to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to the high office of Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session and toassure you of the full support of the delegation ofKazakhstan in your work.Kazakhstan  in welcoming the efforts of theSecretary-General to reform the United Nations  supportsthe decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its lastsession. The steps taken in that direction will undoubtedlyfacilitate the renewal of the Organization in the changinghistorical conditions.On the threshold of the twenty-first century  theworld is becoming an integrated and interrelated systemin which there is no room for autarchy and self-isolation.Globalization  which embraces the main spheres of humanactivity  has radically altered the accustomed assumptionsabout the realities of modern life. Globalization alsocompels us to reassess the nature of internationalcooperation from the standpoint of strengtheningmultilateral mechanisms for taking decisions on the urgentproblems that are of concern to the entire world17community. Despite all the diversity of national interests such decisions need to be taken through joint efforts on thebasis of goodwill and consensus  and here the role of theUnited Nations cannot be underestimated.On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  we again note the permanentsignificance of that instrument in affirming democraticvalues and the rule of law.Kazakhstan  seven years after making its choice ofdemocracy and an open society  is today taking tangiblesteps to intensify its political reforms. Our country isembarking on a comprehensive programme ofdemocratization that covers such important spheres aselections  political parties  Parliament  civil society  thejudicial system  the advancement of women and the massmedia. The President of Kazakhstan  Mr. NursultanNazarbaev  will be taking decisive steps to solve acutesocial problems  combat corruption and optimize the Stateadministration.All these measures are aimed at further protecting andguaranteeing the rights and freedoms of every citizen of ourmulti-ethnic society. We shall do everything within ourpower to preserve such values as inter-ethnic harmony andthe diversity of the cultures and customs of each of thenationalities that make up the people of Kazakhstan. Weshall strengthen pluralism in society in order reliably toguarantee the freedoms of conscience  speech and the pressand further to strengthen the foundations of a seculardemocratic society.Kazakhstan does not believe that it is possible to buildits own statehood without successful integration into theworld economy and world politics. In this context  we aredeveloping and strengthening our national financialinstitutions  which has enabled us to cope  at lower cost with the consequences of the crisis affecting Asia and thecountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States(CIS).As a proponent of a policy of integration  our head ofState is a constant advocate of creating the appropriateeconomic conditions for this to take place and hasproposed  as Chairman of the Customs Union  theconclusion of a treaty on the creation of a unified economicspace within the CIS.Kazakhstan  which pursues a policy of constructivecooperation  has created a zone of security and goodneighbourliness around its borders. We are not inconfrontation with any State in the world. As a EurasianState  Kazakhstan sees the development of friendly equitable and mutually beneficial relations with thecountries of the East and the West as a priority of itsforeign policy.We believe that Kazakhstan’s voluntary renunciationof its nuclear heritage and its firm adherence to the nonproliferation regime constitute important prerequisites forthe attainment of this strategic objective. A few days ago the second International Conference on the problems ofnon-proliferation was held in the town of Kurchatov which is within the territory of the former nuclear testingground at Semipalatinsk. During the conference  the laststrategic missile launch silo was shut down.Kazakhstan consistently advocates the creation ofsecurity structures on the Asian continent. We note withsatisfaction that the initiative of our country’s President toconvene a conference on interaction and confidencebuilding measures in Asia is taking solid shape andbecoming a tangible factor in present-day internationallife. This is attested to by the meeting which took placein Almaty in July of the leaders of Kazakhstan  China  theRussian Federation  Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan on issuesof cooperation and confidence-building measures in theregion. We believe that the agreements signed with Chinaon the delimitation of the Kazakh-Chinese border willmake a major contribution to strengthening regionalsecurity and stability. The Kazakh-Russian Declaration oneternal friendship and alliance for the twenty-first centuryand the Treaty of eternal friendship between Kazakhstan Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are also of great importance.Kazakhstan  as a firm proponent of strengtheningregional and global security  strongly condemns anyundermining of the non-proliferation regime and calls onIndia and Pakistan to heed the views of the vast majorityof the world community and accede without delay to theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We supportthe call of the Secretary-General of the United Nations forthose countries to join in the negotiations on prohibitionsof the production of fissionable materials for nuclearweapons and to refrain from deploying such weapons intheir territory. In the context of strengthening regionalsecurity and the non-proliferation regime  Kazakhstan willcontinue to work for the creation of a nuclear-weaponfree zone in Central Asia.The demonstrations of our country’s involvement inthe peacekeeping activities of the United Nations include18the formation of a peacekeeping battalion in Central Asiaand Kazakhstan’s participation in the United Nations standby arrangements system.From this high podium  we cannot fail to pay attentionto the current situation in Afghanistan. The events takingplace there  which are accompanied by mass violations ofhuman rights and the fundamental norms of internationallaw  have become a subject of profound concern to us.Kazakhstan has made and will continue to make itscontribution to the achievement of peace in that country.The task of the world community is to convince all theparties to the conflict to cease military action right awayand sit down at the negotiating table with a view toestablishing a Government of national reconciliation. Weare convinced that no military solution to the Afghanproblem exists. A peace process in Afghanistan is possibleonly if interference from outside is halted and full supportis given to the efforts of the Secretary-General. Not onlyimmediate neighbours  but all interested countries  musttake an active part in the search for ways of solving theAfghan problem.One of the most difficult present-day problems isinternational terrorism and organized crime. Kazakhstanrejects terrorism in all its manifestations and is ready toparticipate in international efforts to combat this evil. Onthe threshold of the next century  a handful of madmencannot be allowed to blackmail and endanger the lives andwell-being of people who uphold the ideas of creation andpeace. This is doubly dangerous in the case of nuclearterrorism.International organized crime is associated in one wayor another with illegal drug-trafficking. Most unfortunately the scale of the drug business is constantly growing. Drugaddiction  moving freely across borders  is underminingstatehood and the moral foundations of society.Increasingly  more young people are becoming addicted todrugs. We are witnessing a new phenomenon of drugproduction becoming a leading component of nationaleconomies. Drugs from Afghanistan are to be found invirtually all countries of the world. Accordingly  we supportthe decisions of the twentieth special session of the GeneralAssembly on international drug control and will participateactively in their implementation.In speaking of the main problems that ail mankind  wecannot forget separatism. Kazakhstan has more than oncestated its position that it does not accept ethnic separatism.Given the calamities it is inflicting on many States  now isthe time to declare unambiguously that separatism must beproclaimed outside the law. The right of nations to selfdetermination cannot under present historicalcircumstances play the role that it played at the beginningof this century.Yet another global problem which casts a cloud overthe future of mankind is the ever deterioratingenvironmental situation. Kazakhstan has in all truthexperienced the consequences of environmental disasters.From this high podium  the President of Kazakhstan hasmore than once called on the world community to unifyand coordinate efforts to protect the environment. We aregrateful to the General Assembly for the support that hasbeen extended to our country  as reflected in theresolution on assistance in overcoming the consequencesof the nuclear tests in the Semipalatinsk region.The Aral Sea disaster has become genuinely globalin nature. Deposits of salt from the exposed bed of theAral Sea have been found in the Arctic Ocean and inWestern Europe. While noting with gratitude theassistance from the United Nations  we nevertheless callon the States Members of our Organization to pay greaterattention to this serious problem and to take more activeand specific steps to solve it.The peculiarity of the geographical situation ofKazakhstan  and of Central Asia as a whole  confronts uswith an acute problem of access to world markets including the transport of hydrocarbons. Kazakhstantherefore attaches great importance to cooperation withthe United Nations and its specialized agencies to developtransit transport systems in the landlocked Central AsianStates.Reviving the traditions of the Great Silk Road Kazakhstan is interested in expanding and developingtransportation networks in Central Asia and beyond. Ourcountry  with its vast territory  is an important linkbetween Asia and Europe. Our participation in theTransport Corridor: Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA)project will undoubtedly facilitate an increase in theeffectiveness of the transport system in the vast area ofthe Eurasian continent.We place great hopes in the United Nations SpecialProgramme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA) recently adopted by the Economic Commission forEurope and the Economic and Social Commission forAsia and the Pacific.19Kazakhstan  as the Chairman of the EconomicCooperation Organization (ECO)  intends to make a realcontribution to stepping up the activity of this importantregional forum. The Declaration and other documentsadopted at the ECO summit in Almaty creates goodprerequisites for the creation of a favourable trade climatein relations between the ECO member countries and theirpotential partners in Europe and Asia. We believe that ECOis a promising organization and has great potential forexpanding economic ties in the territories of 10 States witha total population of more than 300 million people.Kazakhstan will work for the further strengthening ofcooperation between the ECO and the United Nations.Another issue that must be included among today’surgent problems is the legal status of the Caspian Sea. Wenote with satisfaction the progress made in reachingconsensus on this complex and delicate subject  whichaffects the interrelations among the five littoral States. Theagreement signed between Kazakhstan and the RussianFederation in July this year on the delimitation of thenorthern part of the Caspian Sea lays the foundations for acomplete settlement of the Caspian problem. It is nowimportant to take concrete steps for the implementation ofthis instrument  which is in conformity with the provisionsof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.A solution of the Caspian problem is of strategicimportance for Kazakhstan. We are interested in reliablyensuring the export of our mineral resources throughmultiple-option oil-gas pipelines. We expect earlyimplementation of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium project and we believe that the construction of an oil pipeline fromwestern Kazakhstan to China offers promising prospects.We support the trans-Caspian project for an oil and gaspipeline  Baku-Ceyhan  and we view the project for an oilpipeline through the territory of Iran as very promising.It must be noted with regret that mankind will beentering the next century burdened by many seriousproblems. But  at the same time  there are no grounds forunrelieved pessimism  since the passing century  whichwitnessed two world wars  the development and testing oflethal types of weapons and a multiplicity of regional andethnic conflicts  has developed reliable mechanisms — ourOrganization first among them — for preventing andsettling international problems. The cause of peace  securityand development is of concern to all States. We must therefore  all act as a united whole. Kazakhstan is ready totake part in this work for peace and cooperation."
"88",3699,"KEN",53,1998,"I would like to begin bycongratulating the President on his unanimous election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession. I am confident that under his able leadership andwith his vast diplomatic experience  we shall have fruitfuldeliberations and a successful session.Allow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for the skill and sensitivity hedisplayed while presiding over the work of the GeneralAssembly during its fifty-second session.May I also take this opportunity to commend theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his untiringefforts to build a prosperous United Nations through theongoing reforms to better meet the challenges of the nextmillennium. Although adjustment and reorientation cansometimes be painful  I am confident that underMr. Annan's leadership the United Nations will continueto flourish. Kenya supports the Secretary-General in theseefforts.The General Assembly provides Member States withan opportunity to discuss and gain useful insights andperceptions on key global issues of common concern tothe international community  such as securing a stable 32peaceful and equitable world order. In this context  wecontinue to witness the presence of the United Nations inpeacekeeping and peace-building  development programmesand humanitarian assistance in Africa  Europe  Asia and theAmericas.In our own region  for example  I wish to mention thegood work of the Nairobi-based Great Lakes Programme which operates under the auspices of the United NationsGreat Lakes Task Force on Relief  Reconstruction andDevelopment. This Programme is funded by the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) and contributesimmensely to identifying the development priorities of theGreat Lakes countries as they endeavour to make atransition from conflict to development. Furthermore Kenya appreciates the timely response by the UnitedNations Disaster Management Team to drought and thefloods caused by El Niño. In addition  the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)  with the support of the World Food Programme(WFP)  continues to look after the needs of refugees in ourcountry. All these efforts by United Nations agencies arecommendable and need to be encouraged and sustained.In the last 10 years  we have witnessed significantadvances in democracy  respect for human rights andinternational cooperation. Unfortunately  this was also aperiod in which an estimated 4 million people were killedin armed conflicts. A majority of these conflicts  whichnow threaten international peace and security  are of anintra-State rather than inter-State nature. Currently  there areup to 30 civil wars and a much larger number of lower-intensity conflicts being fought around the world. This newpattern of conflicts comes with new problems and newchallenges for conflict resolution. There is a need  therefore to review the existing conflict resolution mechanisms so asto meet these new challenges. As the Secretary-General?sSpecial Representative for Children and Armed Conflictpointed out to the Security Council in June this year “Both international and national actors need to takepolitical  economic and social measures that cangenerate within communities a sense of hope in placeof despair  a sense of inclusion and participationinstead of exclusion  a sense of belonging instead ofalienation”. (S/PV.3896  p. 5)The credibility of the international community isanchored in its ability to dispense just and sometimesradical solutions to important questions. I have in mind thecommendable resolve of the world community to punish theperpetrators of war crimes and other violations ofinternational humanitarian law. In this connection  Kenyawelcomes the work of the International CriminalTribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia  as wellas the International Criminal Court  which shall soonbecome a reality. The international community mustdemonstrate its resolve to pursue such criminal elementswhoever and wherever they are.Kenya supports the legitimization and strengtheningof regional bodies in peacekeeping. The Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  under the Organization of African Unity(OAU) in West Africa  stand out as examples of regionalorganizations that have contributed immensely topeacekeeping in conflict situations. I should also underlinethe commendable role played by the Commonwealth ofIndependent States and the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe in the conflicts in Croatia; Bosniaand Herzegovina; Albania; Abkhazia  Georgia; andcurrently in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia.In Africa  the forces of the ECOWAS MonitoringGroup (ECOMOG) reinstalled the democratically electedGovernment of President Kabbah of Sierra Leone andrestored constitutional order in Liberia. The superbperformance of the Inter-African Mission to Monitor theImplementation of the Bangui Agreements (MISAB) inthe Central African Republic also deservescommendation. In the Eastern African region  theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)continues to promote political dialogue between thewarring factions in the Sudan and Somalia. In southernAfrica  the Southern African Development Community(SADC) has embarked on initiatives to address  inter alia the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.These regional organizations have made significantprogress in conflict resolution and should be given duerecognition and the necessary support. However  I wouldlike to emphasize that the responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security remainsprimarily with the United Nations Security Council.The holding of special meetings on the causes ofconflict and the promotion of durable peace andsustainable development in Africa underscored the needfor a concerted international effort to promote peace andsecurity in our continent. During the special meeting onAfrica held in September 1997 and the follow-up meetingof 24 September 1998  the Security Council observedthat  despite the progress achieved by some African33States  the number and intensity of armed conflicts on thecontinent remained a matter of grave concern. We share theview of the Secretary-General that durable peace andeconomic development go hand in hand. Kenya welcomesthe challenge posed by the Secretary-General in the threebroad areas he emphasized in his report: the necessity forAfrica to rely on political rather than military responses toproblems; the need to summon the political will to seriouslypromote good governance  human rights and democracy;and  finally  the necessity to undertake and adhere tovarious reforms necessary to promote political stability andeconomic growth.While the general tendency is to seek ways ofdeepening political cooperation and economic integration the unity and stability of some States  especially on theAfrican continent  is being threatened by ethnic  social andother intra-State conflicts. In particular  conflicts in theGreat Lakes region  Somalia and southern Sudan — and more recently  the inter-State conflict between Ethiopia andEritrea — are of major concern to us. Kenya has been andwill continue to be involved in efforts aimed at reducingtension in Africa and  indeed  beyond.In 1996 and 1997  Kenya hosted the various Nairobisummits on the conflict in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and  indeed  the conflict in the southern Sudan under the auspices of IGAD. More recently  President Moimet separately with the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea inan effort to secure their commitment to pursuingnegotiations rather than war in their border dispute. Theseefforts have helped to complement the important initiativesof the United Nations  the Organization of African Unityand others and have  in our view  contributed to ensuringthe avoidance of a full-scale war between Ethiopia andEritrea. I trust the necessary goodwill exists for a negotiatedfinal settlement in this conflict.Regarding Somalia  we are concerned about the lackof progress in the efforts to restore normalcy and statehoodto that country. Both the IGAD and the Cairo initiativeshave stalled. However  the cessation of hostilities; theagreement by the warring factions in Mogadishu to have ajoint administration for the hitherto divided city; and thereopening of the harbour and airport are encouraging. It isour hope that the parties concerned will resume seriousdialogue sooner rather than later.In June this year  the Security Council held an opendebate on children and armed conflict. This is a matter ofparticular interest to Africa  where there are horrifyingaccounts of atrocities to which children are subject or inwhich they participate. We are painfully aware of thedisturbing new phenomenon of “armed labour” in someparts of Africa and are therefore concerned about thepossibility that children could be involved in theseactivities. There is the added dimension of the easyavailability of illegal small arms which  as pointed outlast week by Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen of theNetherlands  have the potential of destabilizing the wholeregion.Children are our future and all should continue tosupport the work of the Secretary-General and his SpecialRepresentative to safeguard and protect them in areas ofarmed conflict. To that end  my delegation reiterates theneed for strict compliance by all Member States with therelevant provisions of international law.Kenya believes that the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was a crucialstep in the fulfilment of one of the main objectives in theimplementation of relevant obligations under the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We believethat our common objective should lead to completenuclear disarmament by the nuclear-weapon States.It is regrettable that the perceived lack of seriouscommitment by nuclear-weapon States to moving rapidlytowards genuine disarmament recently provided an excusefor others to conduct nuclear tests. There is therefore aneed for security assurances from non-nuclear-weaponStates and  even more importantly  for urgent measuresand renewed efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons.We expect the nuclear-weapon States to take theirresponsibilities seriously by seizing the initiative towardsthe total elimination of nuclear weapons from our planet.The process of development during the past decadehas been uneven. A number of developing countriesrecorded high rates of growth and have been able toaccelerate development. However  many of the developingcountries  especially those in Africa  have made modestprogress. The disparities in economic growth amongdeveloping countries have largely widened. Theseconditions have taken place against a backdrop of rapidchanges in the world economy  characterized by the twinprocesses of globalization and liberalization  which havebecome the hallmark of global economic policy. Thepreferential treatment enjoyed by a large number ofdeveloping countries under the Generalized System ofPreferences and other preferential trading arrangements such as the Lomé Convention  continues to be eroded.34It is imperative for the international community tostrengthen commodity-dependent countries by means ofexpanded market access for their products  as well assupport in the development of their technical and humancapacities so that they may actively participate in themultilateral trading system. In this regard  my delegationwould like to urge the effective implementation of theUruguay Round results  especially with regard to marketaccess for goods and services of export interest todeveloping countries.Developing countries  especially those in sub-SaharanAfrica  have  during the past decade  undertaken manyefforts aimed at attracting foreign direct investment.Unfortunately  these efforts have not yielded any significantinflows. International capital flows play an important rolein the process of development. Kenya reiterates the need forincreased access to international financial markets for theacquisition of finance on concessionary terms by developingcountries. In this context  Kenya attaches great importanceto the convening of an international conference on financingfor development under the auspices of the United Nations.The liberalization of financial transactions and theincreasing freedom of capital mobility have becomeimportant policy objectives for many countries. Theresultant need to grapple with massive international capitalflows  coupled with the experiences of financial turbulenceand turmoil in some Asian economies  has highlighted theneed to reform the international financial system. On theAsian financial crisis  my delegation wishes to advocatemeasures aimed at the restoration of stability in the affectedcountries to avoid serious negative consequences around theglobe.The external debt problem of low-income developingcountries  especially those in sub-Saharan Africa  remainsunresolved. The international community is called upon totake actions aimed at finding lasting solutions to the debtproblem. On official bilateral debt  while we are gratifiedat the adoption of the Naples terms by the Paris Club  theslow pace of their implementation continues to be ofconcern. Kenya wishes to urge the Paris Club of creditorcountries to revise the eligibility criteria so as to allow forthe inclusion of all low-income developing countries. Theproblem of multilateral debt also needs to be accordedserious attention  taking into account issues such asincreased concessional finance  debt cancellation  debtreduction and debt relief.My delegation would like to express concern over thedeclining trend in real terms of official developmentassistance over the years. In this regard  Kenya wishes tocall for the expeditious reversal of this trend by donorcountries in line with their commitments in variousUnited Nations resolutions and with the aim of meetingthe internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of grossnational product. The interdependence of the globaleconomy makes it necessary for those of us in thedeveloping world to call upon the internationalcommunity  including the United Nations agencies international financial institutions and multilateral andbilateral donors  to support the implementation ofstrategies for the development of the developing countriesand to give priority to financing for development andexpansion of trade in those countries through mobilizationof new and additional resources.Kenya welcomes the appointment of Mr. KlausTöpfer as Director-General of the United Nations Officeat Nairobi and the elevation of the Nairobi centre to thelevel of other United Nations centres at Vienna andGeneva. As the United Nations proceeds with reformmeasures to ensure the efficient use of resources  it isimperative for the Organization to ensure maximal andrational use of existing facilities within the system tominimize waste. As host to the only United Nationscentre in the developing world  we are concerned thatfacilities at the Nairobi Office continue to beunderutilized. Kenya would appreciate seeing maximalutilization of facilities at the headquarters of the UnitedNations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UnitedNations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT) to tryand reach the capacity-utilization levels of Geneva andVienna. In this regard  we wish to thank the Secretary-General for the various measures he has taken  aimed atimproving this situation. Kenya  however  still urges thatthe various General Assembly resolutions on this matterbe adhered to.We also note that both UNEP and HABITAT needto be strengthened by streamlining their administrativeand financial management. In this connection. Kenyawelcomes the establishment of the Task Force onEnvironment and Human Settlements  whose task is toprovide recommendations for new measures to strengthenand restructure those two organizations on the basis ofGeneral Assembly resolutions 2997 (XXVII) and 32/162 while taking into account decisions and recommendationsof the Governing Council of UNEP and the Commissionon Human Settlements. The report of the Task Forcecaptures the challenges we continue to face in this area.It states that human demands on the global life-supportsystem continue to mount as poverty and affluence spread35in parallel around the globe. Despite all the efforts madesince the United Nations Conference on the HumanEnvironment  held at Stockholm  the environment continuesto deteriorate in many parts of the world. Certain social economic and technological trends are exacerbating theseproblems. Against this background  it is imperative thatUNEP be strengthened through the provision of adequateand predictable financial resources to better execute itsmandate  and that more vigorous and coordinated action betaken to respond effectively to these problems. In line withresolution 52/220  Kenya urges that energetic steps be takenon the funding from the regular budget of the UnitedNations Office at Nairobi in order to enable it to dischargeits mandate.My delegation welcomes this opportunity to express itsoutrage at and condemnation of the criminal and unjustifiedterrorist bombings which occurred simultaneously inNairobi and in Dar-es-Salaam on 7 August 1998. Terroristacts are by design ruthlessly indiscriminate  and the bombblast in Nairobi  which occurred at one of the busiestlocations in the city in terms of human traffic andcommercial activities  was no exception. It has so farclaimed 250 lives  and the death toll continues to rise.Damage estimated at over $500 million was caused by thebomb blast.The bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam broughtmayhem and terror of an untold magnitude to our twocountries  which had hitherto considered themselves secureand far removed from the threats and dangers posed by actsof international terrorism. These two incidents not onlymake it abundantly clear that nobody is safe or unaffectedby such heinous acts  but also exemplify the expandingreach and growing menace of the perpetrators of terroristacts.Let me take this opportunity on behalf of theGovernment of Kenya to express gratitude for the generousassistance and support promptly made available in therescue efforts by Governments and internationalorganizations  and by volunteers who came from far andwide.Kenya welcomes the General Assembly?s adoptionearlier this year of the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings. In this regard  we wishto underscore the importance of enhancing internationalcooperation to combat terrorism in accordance with therelevant international instruments. We support the proposalof the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries calling for theconvening of an international conference under the auspicesof the United Nations to formulate an organized andconcerted response by the international community toterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate that Kenya willcontinue to participate actively in the work of theOrganization and to bear its rightful share ofresponsibilities and obligations under the Charter. As weenter the new millennium  we should all contribute to theeffort to chart a new course for a reinvigorated UnitedNations in a manner that fulfils the vision of its foundersand meets the challenge of our generation and ofgenerations to come."
"89",3723,"KGZ",53,1998,"Allow me to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti onhis election to the important post of President of theGeneral Assembly at this session. This is a testimony to thewidespread recognition of the country that he represents. Iam convinced that his rich experience and diplomatic skillwill allow him to successfully conduct this session of theAssembly and deal with the important tasks before it.I would also like to express my sincere thanks to thePresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-secondsession  the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Mr. Udovenko  for his fruitful work over the past year.It would be difficult to underestimate the importanceof the United Nations in the fields of peace and security development  human rights  ecology and economiccooperation. Kyrgyzstan wishes deeply to see theOrganization successfully reformed. The SecretaryGeneral’s “quiet revolution” of institutional reforms  beguna year ago  has given new strength to the United Nationsmechanism.The first  most important steps towards making thisrevolution a success have already been taken  but a greatdeal remains to be done. As the previous session showed the process of reforming the Organization so that it isprepared to respond to the challenges of the comingmillennium will require more time and more work thanexpected.The reforms of the United Nations will beincomplete if they do not apply to all of its organs including the Security Council. We judge the Council byits effectiveness. In that connection  we support theSecretary-General’s proposal to expand the role of theCouncil. We share his view that the Council should dealwith economic and social processes  which have animpact on peace and security  just as energetically as itworks to resolve political issues. We also believe itessential not only to improve the working methods of theCouncil  but also to expand its membership. In ouropinion  the quantitative expansion of the Council shouldtake place in both categories of membership and providefor equitable geographic representation. Further  the newpermanent members of the Council should have all theprivileges appropriate to their status.The difficult reform process that all aspects ofKyrgyz society have been undergoing during the sevenyears of our independence has yielded certain results. Themain result has been the preservation of political stability further democratization of the society and the extensionof economic reforms.Lacking access to the sea  Kyrgyzstan is seekingnew transport routes  which are essential for facilitatingthe movement of goods  capital and services into theregion. It is acquiring new information technology andelectronic communications  which will help the countrymodernize. Kyrgyzstan wishes to develop regionalcooperation within the framework of the Central Asianeconomic community and the Commonwealth ofIndependent States. It also believes in the necessity ofcooperation with other regions.In that connection  I would like to mention thetimeliness and importance of President A. Akayev’sdoctrine of “Silk Road Diplomacy”. A revival of the ideaof the great Silk Road presupposes the transformation ofthe area along the road into a zone of stability  security cooperation and equitable partnership. The idea ofreviving this road also represents a commitment tocreating favourable conditions for increased internationalcooperation so that we can take joint action to solve theglobal problems that confront mankind at the threshold ofthe third millennium.The national strategy of the Kyrgyz Republichighlights sustainable development as the basis for stableand secure human development as we enter the newmillennium. The implementation of the decisions adoptedat the World Summit for Social Development are of29immense importance for the Kyrgyz Republic. For countrieswith economies in transition — countries seeking to findtheir way to sustainable growth — it is especially importantthat there be coordination and joint action within arevitalized United Nations  the Bretton Woods institutionsand regional organizations in order to accelerate theintegration of these countries into the world economy.A priority for Kyrgyz development is solving thethree-headed problem of modern times: how to promote theeconomy  ecology and social development. I should pointout that ecology is the cornerstore of sustainabledevelopment for Kyrgyzstan. The harmony of man andnature is at the heart of the sustainable developmentprogramme adopted by the Government of Kyrgyzstan lastyear.Kyrgyzstan is a mountainous country; most of itsterritory — 95 per cent — is covered by mountains.Mountains  as is well known  are an important source offresh water  biological diversity  mineral resources andenergy  as well as being extremely important for tourism.At the same time  however  mountains means surprises anddangers. Earthquakes  landslides  avalanches  floods — allthreaten human lives and require enormous financial andmaterial expenditures. In that connection  Kyrgyzstan isdeeply grateful to United Nations Member States for theirsupport of its initiative to declare the year 2002 aninternational year of mountains  and we request them tocontinue to support the initiative at this session of theAssembly.The Kyrgyz Republic’s policy of peace  which isfocused on the new trend towards a multipolar globalsystem  presupposes  inter alia  a safe  non-nuclear future.The specific steps Kyrgyzstan has taken in the area ofnuclear disarmament and in strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime confirm its commitment to this policy.Appropriately  the Central Asian countries’ initiativeto create a nuclear-weapon-free zone was on the agenda ofthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly. Duringthat session a resolution on the establishment of such azone in Central Asia was adopted by consensus.Today it is a pleasure for me to state that theconsultative meeting of experts of Central Asian countries nuclear-weapon States and the United Nations  which tookplace on 9 and 10 July in Bishkek  laid the legal foundationfor the Central Asian initiative. This is a new stage in thecreation of the zone. In this connection  we believe it usefulto continue regular meetings between experts of theregional working group and those of the nuclear-weaponStates  with the participation of representatives of theUnited Nations and the International Atomic EnergyAgency.This year’s session coincides with the fiftiethanniversary of United Nations peacekeeping operations.Kyrgyzstan completely supports the peacekeeping effortsthe Organization has undertaken in various global hotspots. At the same time  we believe that  along withpeacekeeping operations  more attention should be paid tothe early prevention of conflicts — so-called preventiveor quiet diplomacy aimed at preventing disputes fromturning into conflicts.Kyrgyzstan is seriously concerned by the armedconflict that has lasted for almost two decades inAfghanistan. We are also seriously alarmed at the militaryconfrontation and the grave humanitarian situation inKosovo  the situation in Africa and the absence ofprogress in the Middle East  Cyprus and the Koreanpeninsula.However  we are equally concerned about thefinancial crises in South-East Asia  Russia and LatinAmerica and the nuclear- weapons tests conducted byIndia and Pakistan. For  as history shows  the sources ofconflict  despite being very different  are at the same timevery similar. Armed conflicts are accompanied byviolence  mass exodus of refugees  illegal trafficking indrugs and weapons and flagrant disregard for andviolations of human rights. The territory of countriesexperiencing armed conflicts is often utilized to trainprofessional mercenaries and terrorists.Terrorism long ago crossed national borders andbecame international in nature. Thousands of innocentpeople have become its victims  including children women and elderly people. Particular phenomena of thepast century have been terrorist bombings and nuclearterrorism. We support the proposals for accelerating workon a draft convention to combat acts of nuclear terrorism.Kyrgyzstan firmly opposes any form or type of terrorismand calls on the international community to pool itsefforts against this global threat.Kyrgyzstan’s six years as a Member of the UnitedNations have been a good training ground forparticipation in the United Nations family. Together withother countries  we have striven to establish a world ofgreater justice  to achieve social progress in the interest ofhumankind and to assert human dignity and equal rights forall.As the twenty-first century draws closer  what theworld becomes will depend primarily on our joint efforts —the efforts of all United Nations Member States."
"90",3811,"KNA",53,1998,"It is indeed myprivilege  on behalf of the Government and people of SaintKitts and Nevis  to have this opportunity once again toaddress the General Assembly.I feel especially pleased to participate this year  whichcoincides with the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights an instrument that has sought for the last 50 years toprotect and advance the political  social and cultural humanrights of peoples around the world.Throughout this half-century  the debate on humanrights has focused critical attention on cultural  social andpolitical rights. Regrettably  we have failed to develop aninternational agenda which includes economic rights as anintegral part of fundamental human rights.Conceptually  political human rights  now a criticalcomponent of some foreign policy positions  have beenfused imperceptibly with democracy  hence politics andhuman rights have become synonymous. I too am anadvocate of human rights protection  and I believe stronglythat if we insist on politics in human rights  the politicsshould be to enhance human dignity and the humancondition by including all rights. The corpus of humanrights demands innovative approaches whereby anindividual?s human rights are not measured only by thefreedom to vote but also by the right to self-development ina holistic sense.On the eve of the new millennium  I am still quitedissatisfied with the level of attention the world communityis paying to the severe economic  environmental andpotential political problems that threaten small islanddeveloping States. These problems are not new to thisforum; they are well established and documented facts.Only last year  I spoke about the vulnerability of smallisland States and the need to establish practical  viableprogrammes to help us in our own development process. Ilamented also last year the serious and ill-conceived notionof graduating small States like Saint Kitts and Nevis intoartificial categories based on gross national product percapita.Today  I stand before the Assembly havingwitnessed firsthand the effects of hurricane Georges which brought all sectors of the economy of Saint Kittsand Nevis to a standstill and increased the possibility ofsuffering. In a matter of a few hours  the growth andprogress of the last few years have been literally wipedfrom the landscape of our lives. Large sectors of our ruralcommunities in particular now appear to be reverting toa state of abject poverty.This is the stark reality — the reality of small islanddeveloping States. We have no tolerance for bureaucratsor financial houses telling us which levels of developmentare acceptable. Our reality after a hurricane is aboutpeople living without the basic necessities that we all takefor granted. It is about families displaced  having to watchtheir dreams in ruins. It is about women and childrenmade homeless. This is about real life  not just figuresarbitrarily concocted for dubious purposes.It seems that we have become a community thatrelies heavily on figures. Therefore  let me share some ofthese figures here. Initial estimates of the damage andloss in productivity caused by only one hurricane havebeen placed at over $400 million  far exceeding the grossdomestic product of Saint Kitts and Nevis. An estimated85 per cent of the residential housing stock suffered slightto major damage; of that 85 per cent  approximately 25per cent was destroyed. The agricultural sector  one of themajor pillars on which the Saint Kitts and Nevis economystands  has been devastated.Agricultural output — sugar and non-sugar alike —is expected to be reduced by as much as 50 per cent nextyear. The health sector and our ability to provide high-quality care have been seriously compromised. Not onlydid the smaller rural hospitals suffer damage to propertyand equipment  but also the Federation?s main hospital the Joseph N. France General  lost a significant portion ofits roof  and damage to equipment and stocks isconsiderable.The scene of devastation is equally mind-bogglingand severe in other neighbouring islands  such as Haiti the Dominican Republic  Antigua and Barbuda  Cuba andSt. Maarten. The suffering in my country is therefore notunique. However  the fact that we suffer the same fateyear after year and rebuild only to watch our progresswashed and blown away so easily speaks to the need tolook seriously at the vulnerability of small island States.21I make an urgent appeal for the internationalcommunity to come to the aid of our countries and ourpeoples. A draft resolution will shortly be introduced to theAssembly on countries of the north-eastern Caribbeanaffected by this year?s storm  and I urge countries tosupport this effort by co-sponsoring the draft. Also  I wishto express the gratitude of my Government to thoseagencies  persons and Governments which have respondedso readily in lending assistance.I would hasten to add that the task of rebuilding willnot finish as soon as the eyes of the camera shift theirfocus  nor will normalcy in its true sense return in a matterof weeks. We need material  technical and financial supporton an ongoing basis as we rebuild our country.I feel compelled to reiterate the problems of smallStates  especially in the light of continuous attempts toundermine our economies. My Government does not takelightly the complaints brought before the World TradeOrganization  which are tantamount to the devastatinghurricane winds on the small  vulnerable banana-producingeconomies in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States.I also fear that  as such initiatives continue  the sugarindustry in my own country will suffer a similar fate. Ournegligible exports  in percentage terms  cannot pose anycredible threat to any transnational corporation or largeproducer of bananas and sugar. However  the removal ofthis fragile access  which we must fight to maintain  couldwreak untold havoc in social and economic terms on thelives of so many poor families in the eastern Caribbeanregion.The insidious tentacles of injustice have suchtremendous reach that international institutions such as theUnited Nations will be expected to devise ways to arrest itscorrosive character by lending considerable support to theefforts of small island developing countries.I say all this against the backdrop that most decisively the twentieth century has etched in our consciousnessevidence of the power of the human mind in its infinitecreativity and potential. Now we are able to cure illnessesonce thought incurable  and we create technological featsthat boggle the mind. I therefore salute the men and womenwho have made this century great.It becomes critically important  therefore  that asnations we utilize these landmark developments and sharedexperiences as the blueprints for the enormous challengesof poverty eradication  illicit drug trafficking  nuclearproliferation  warmongering  economic inequity  anddisaster prevention and mitigation.Inasmuch as this century has brought exceptionaltechnological advances  economic initiative and growth the new millennium will demand greater moral strengthand public leadership. It will require its leaders to developsimilar courage and statesmanship against powerfulchallenges. It will dare us all to harness the moral energyto transcend partisan agendas in favour of a commonglobal imperative.It is impractical to alienate an individual?s humanrights from the right to development. These areinseparable and paramount. My Government regards thegrowth of human rights in its entirety as a genuine steptowards strengthening democracy itself. In order fordemocracy to take root and the democratic process todevelop in its sincerest sense  we must nurture thecomplete range of fundamental human rights. Then andonly then will the human person flourish.When we hold ourselves up as standard bearers ofdemocracy and bastions of human rights protection  itbecomes essential to preserve human dignity worldwide.It has been said “when the empire of man over nature can no longerbe easily extended  then the only way for a peopleto increase its standard of living is by redistributingthe sources or fruits of industry from others tothemselves”.Any real hope for a more peaceful and equitabletwenty-first century lies in the evolution of our thinkingon human rights and other issues critical to small islandStates. One of the most crucial challenges in the comingcentury will be to address the quicksand of uneveneconomic development within the current economicsystem. These have direct consequences for the disparitiesin wealth and resource distribution. I raise the issue ofvulnerability not to crave preferential treatment for ourregion  but because the international community must bemindful of our peculiar circumstances.It is being said that the structure and growth of theworld investment climate are being shaped by currentevents such as the Asian crisis  the European monetaryunion  along with the creation of the euro  advances intechnology  liberalization of national financial marketsand their integration into a global market. Where does thissituation leave small island developing States like Saint22Kitts and Nevis  especially when so many critical factorsmilitate against our development priorities?Foreign direct investment is considered one of themain vehicles of the liberalization process. Smalldeveloping economies are being forced to liberalize andintegrate into the centre of a global economic system whichhas always relegated us to the periphery. Internationalcapital is steadfastly in search of new markets  yet hascontinued to overlook our region. Consequently  the vastmajority of the $4 trillion in foreign direct investment spentin 1997 bypassed our countries in the Caribbean region. Atthe centre of international integrated investment flows “are large international and transnational corporationsand their affiliates whose global sales volume wasestimated to have reached some $7 trillion in 1995”.This poses the question of how our agri-based andexport-oriented economies cope with or even attempt tocompete against giant transnational institutions in an era inwhich international production has now become moreimportant than exports in terms of the delivery of goodsand services to foreign markets.Foreign direct investment  as I have come tounderstand it  integrates markets through intra-businessactivities and the production systems of countries.Therefore  our economies cannot participate in this hugeand rapidly growing production system because we havenot been given necessary technical  technological andmaterial support to move into the centre of the globalmarket place through its main vehicle — that is production.To make matters worse  we have not been allowedopportunities to gain appropriate access to those criticalmarkets  whereas foreign businesses based in thosecountries have the access and capability to dominate andflood our markets with their cheap products.One only needs to pay casual attention to the media toappreciate the tendency towards national and transnationalmega-mergers and strategic economic business alliancesthat are taking place around the world. Our region is fastdeveloping a competitive disadvantage.Earlier I spoke of injustice. I consider it an injusticewhen capital can be mobilized and deployed in such waysthat could easily destroy the welfare of entire nations withimpunity or stifle competition completely. Globalization hasbeen touted as a great vehicle of opportunity and promise;but I ask  for whom? Globalization  it is said  offers ahuge reservoir of resources for investment growth economic equity and social advancement. However  in myregion we are yet to see these promises. In the Caribbean we are much more familiar with the risks of globalization.In anticipation of the changes taking place  ourcountries have made significant reforms. Regrettably however  the international community  includingprominent international financial institutions  has notalways rallied in support of our efforts. Each year webuild and we rebuild  but we are susceptible to externalforces such as hurricanes. Our efforts  however  seem togo unnoticed.Today  the wide rift between expectation andachievements continues to grow. Saint Kitts and Nevislooks forward to the convening of a special session toreview the implementation of the Barbados Programme ofAction  and the Copenhagen Declaration and Programmeof Action.We urge the United Nations and the internationalfinancial institutions to take a fresh look at ways to helpsmall developing countries integrate into this emergingsystem. However  the rules of this system will have to beinformed by the special situation of vulnerable smallisland States.We welcome initiatives on resource mobilization  onexternal debt relief  on trade and financing fordevelopment and on good governance of the internationalmonetary and financial systems. Good governance shouldrefer not only to developing countries; it ought to beextended to include better management of theinternational economic system. Failure to do so wouldlead only to instability  uncivil societies and anungovernable global market place.The socio-economic and political dilemma facingsmall island developing States must be addressed now;otherwise  the human and political cost would be too highfor us to bear.Many small nations pay our assessed contributionsregularly to the United Nations system despite our meagreresources and the challenges to our national survival. Wetherefore expect more. We expect tangible benefits fromour membership. It is incumbent on the United Nations towork with small island States to ensure that they reap therewards of the changing political market economy.23In my address last June to the United Nations specialsession on drugs  I assured this community of myGovernment?s commitment to fighting the illicit drug trade.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis remains resolutein its commitment to cooperate in the eradication of thenarcotics trade and associated vices.This noble fight against a most nefarious and well-financed enemy carries a high financial cost. It is importantto recognize that the role of consumption is just asimportant as that of supply. Therefore  we have a sharedresponsibility and must focus on joint approaches informedby cooperation and by mutual respect and understanding.Saint Kitts and Nevis remains undaunted and relentless inits approach to the interdiction of illicit drugs  as we worktogether with all nations in the name of justice  equity andadvancing the human condition.In the spirit of advancing the human condition  myGovernment urges restraint  patience and dialogue on thecritical issues that separate the Chinese people in bothgeographic and political terms. It is our sincerest hope thatthe common aspirations and expectations of the Chinesepeople will be fulfilled in the near future in an environmentof peace and mutual respect. We believe that the familybonds and historical tradition that have made the Chinesepeople a great nation ought to be preserved. We believethat the time has come for the voice of the millions ofChinese people in the Republic of China on Taiwan to beheard and factored into the international agenda. We believethat adequate  urgent and practical mechanisms must bedeveloped to allow them to participate in the work of allnations.In a world bedeviled by so many challenges  and inneed of collective action and new resources  we alienatepeople and Governments at our own peril. We have anobligation to work with and encourage the Chinese peopleon both sides of the Taiwan Strait to support the progressmade to date  so that the advancement of the humancondition transcends politics. I urge negotiation and thedevelopment of confidence-building measures as a way tomove towards improving cross-Strait relations.We also call on the Government of Iraq to abide by allUnited Nations resolutions and to release all Kuwaitiprisoners of war and detainees  as well as those from othercountries.In conclusion  as we continue this debate I trust thatwe will be able to move beyond the constraints of thedeveloped/developing country paradigm of us against them.To advance the human condition for all humankind willrequire meaningful partnership. Instead of apportioningblame  I urge Member States to join with me as werededicate our energies to the search for lasting solutions.By working together  it becomes easier to find ways ofattaining our national aspirations without trampling on thelegitimate dreams of others."
"91",3837,"KOR",53,1998,"On behalf of thedelegation of the Republic of Korea  I sincerelycongratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to thepresidency of this session of the General Assembly. We arefully confident that the Assembly will reap fruitful resultsunder his distinguished leadership. I would also like to paytribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Y.Udovenko  and to the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan.I would like to discuss today our common future andthe various efforts that we will need to consider to ensureits betterment. With the new millennium just around thecorner  we must contemplate the possibilities for our futureworld. With confidence and pride  we can look back overthe past five decades and note with appreciation thetremendous contributions the United Nations has madetowards international peace and prosperity. We must alsonote that today the United Nations is confronted withenormous challenges and opportunities. The identificationof these challenges  both within the United Nations itselfand in the world with which the United Nations mustengage  is where our discussion must begin.As a world community  we face trends and challengesthat test our wisdom and courage. Before I discuss ourcommon efforts  I would like to begin by addressing howwe are now handling our own concerns in Korea. LastFebruary  the Republic of Korea inaugurated theGovernment of President Kim Dae-jung. This Governmentcarries special significance for the Korean people becauseit marks the first time an opposition party has acceded topower in the 50-year constitutional history of Korea.The Republic of Korea is one of the countries thatgained independence during the last half-century; it hassubsequently developed into a liberal democracy within arelatively short period of time. Poverty-stricken and war-torn only 50 years ago  the Republic of Korea has nowgrown to be a middle-power State.My country is currently endeavouring to overcomeenormous economic difficulties and to ensure the paralleland harmonious development of democracy and freemarket economy. We are well aware that the world iswatching to see if and how we can accomplish such adifficult task. On 15 August 1998  on the fiftiethanniversary of the Government of the Republic of Korea President Kim Dae Jung proclaimed the launching of our“Second Nation Building” to define the nation?s efforts toovercome the current crisis and to foster Korea?sdemocracy and market economy to greater maturity.Our immediate concerns  however  are not onlyeconomic. The new Government of the Republic of Koreaformulated the “Sunshine Policy”  a policy of constructiveengagement  as the cornerstone of its stance towardsNorth Korea. Division  war and confrontation have moreoften than not characterized inter-Korean relations.Changing the nature of this relationship requires therestoration and cultivation of mutual trust between thetwo parties. To achieve these goals  President Kimannounced the following three principles immediatelyafter his inauguration: no tolerance of any militaryprovocation by North Korea; no attempts on our part toabsorb the North; and the active promotion of inter-Korean reconciliation  exchange and cooperation.In line with these principles  my Government isencouraging private sector initiatives to pursue exchangesand cooperation with the North at their own discretion while maintaining the principle of reciprocity at thegovernmental level. The Republic of Korea will remaincommitted to actively responding to the appeals of theUnited Nations and other international organizations toassist North Korea to overcome its food shortages andeconomic difficulties. We believe that inter-Koreanconsultations are indispensable for North Korea?seconomic recovery. In this regard  we also look forwardto the role of the United Nations system as a facilitator ofthis process.In his August speech  President Kim Dae Jungfurther proposed the establishment of a permanent inter-Korean dialogue arrangement headed by ministerial orvice-ministerial officials  in the hope of opening a new11era of reconciliation and cooperation between the twoKoreas. He also made it clear that the Republic of Korea iswilling to send an envoy to Pyongyang to discuss thisproposal. The main thrust of President Kim?s engagementpolicy is to establish a workable system of peacefulcoexistence based on reconciliation and mutual trust.The Democratic People?s Republic of Korea reactedpassively or even negatively to these proposals. It provokedthe Republic of Korea by infiltrating a submarine intoSouth Korean territorial waters in June  and again in lateAugust by launching a rocket into the western PacificOcean without any prior warning. My Government deploresthese acts of provocation. They pose a serious threat to oursecurity. But despite these acts of provocation  myGovernment continues to uphold the keynote of itsengagement policy so that the two Koreas might come toenjoy the benefits of peaceful coexistence.My Government hopes that the leadership of theDemocratic People?s Republic of Korea will put aside itsdefiance and respond positively to our calls for dialogueand collaboration. We would like to revitalize andimplement the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement of 1992through South-North dialogue. My Government will try toease tension and create a peaceful environment on theKorean Peninsula through the four-party talks process. Iwish to reiterate that our immediate objective is  first andforemost  peaceful coexistence. We hope that theDemocratic People?s Republic of Korea will respond withan equal display of sincerity and good faith to our policiesof accommodation.I would now like to share some thoughts with you onthe current global economic situation. In the past decade we have witnessed deepening interdependence amongcountries in the accelerated  market-driven process ofglobalization. However  contrary to earlier expectations thatthe globalization process would stimulate world economicgrowth and reduce the gap between developed anddeveloping countries  the international community is nowbaffled by the negative repercussions of rapid globalization.Asian countries  which have long been a model ofeconomic development  are now struggling with seriousfinancial crises. Other countries are also suffering economicunrest  and together these may lead to global economicturmoil.The international community  amid sudden andunexpected economic turbulences  would be well advised todevelop a common strategy to maximize potential economicbenefits of market liberalization and globalization. Towardsthis end  my Government welcomes the United Nationsinitiative to strengthen its dialogue and cooperation withthe Bretton Woods system. The United Nations isexpected to play a more active role in addressing diverseproblems arising from the globalization process.Among the various factors that triggered our owndomestic economic difficulties was a loose application ofthe rule of accountability in the corporate and financialsector. My Government is trying to turn the currentfinancial crisis into an opportunity to reform andrevitalize its economy. We are taking bold and decisivesteps towards a comprehensive structural reform based ondemocracy and market principles. This structural reformis intended to ensure deregulation of economic activities transparency and accountability in the financial andcorporate sector  and mobility in the labour market. Whenthe ongoing structural reform is successfully completed the Republic of Korea will be a more free and more opensociety  contributing to the resurgence of economicdynamism in the Asian region. This is the goal of ourstructural reform.In spite of overall growth in the world economy  theleast developed countries continue to be marginalized andstill do not receive their fair share of the benefits of thatgeneral trend. As a community  we should pay moreattention to the deteriorating situation in thesemarginalized countries and should strengthen economicand development cooperation for their sustainable growth.For this purpose  my Government supports thedevelopment of the least developed countries through theKorea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) andcooperates with United Nations regional economiccommissions  such as the Economic and SocialCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and theEconomic Commission for Africa (ECA). Even with thecurrent financial crisis  the Republic of Korea continuesto play its due role in development cooperation  withKOICA as its focal point.While contributing to the strengthening ofmultilateral cooperation  we are also participating inregional cooperation efforts aimed at stimulating andsustaining steady regional growth and balanceddevelopment for the Asia-Pacific region. We arecontributing to regional liberalization of trade andinvestment through active involvement in the Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC). In addition  myGovernment is scheduled to host the third summit of theAsia-Europe Meeting in the year 2000. We will do our12best to make the summit a milestone in building acomprehensive partnership between Asia and Europe.Beyond these immediate concerns for economicrevitalization in Korea and the world community in general we are faced with another long-term challenge  that ofenvironmental protection. Climate changes  for instance demand urgent attention and concrete actions by allcountries. Last year  we made historic progress incombating global warming by adopting the Kyoto Protocol.I am pleased to say that my Government will accede to theKyoto Protocol this afternoon.I should like to take this opportunity to say a fewwords about the International Vaccine Institute (IVI). MyGovernment has hosted IVI as a part of its commitment tointernational efforts to prevent childhood diseases especially those in developing countries. Thirty-twoGovernments and the World Health Organization (WHO)have signed the Establishment Agreement of IVI  aimed atdeveloping and distributing non-commercial vaccines.Yesterday in New York  the Government of the Republicof Korea and IVI signed the Headquarters Agreement. Ilook forward to more active support and to the substantialparticipation of Member States in this worthy project.Fifty years after the adoption of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  and despite strenuous effortsby the United Nations and human rights defenders  we arestill witnessing  to our dismay  serious human rightsviolations and blatant challenges to United Nations humanrights mechanisms throughout the world. Notwithstandingthese grim realities  I am convinced that history is movingtowards universal respect for human rights and dignity. Inthis context  my Government fully supports the Secretary-General?s initiative to mainstream human rights in all of theUnited Nations activities and programmes. As an initiativeto bolster national human rights safeguard mechanisms  myGovernment has begun preparations for enacting acomprehensive human rights act and establishing a nationalhuman rights institution.My Government welcomes the adoption of the Statuteof the International Criminal Court in Rome last July. Weare confident that the establishment of the Court will be alandmark in strengthening the international legal system.We earnestly hope that the Court will be launched as soonas possible.In the rapidly changing international securityenvironment of the post-cold-war era  the United Nations isnow faced with new challenges arising from theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and theirmeans of delivery. We deeply regret the recent nucleartests carried out by India and then Pakistan. These testsseriously undermine the nuclear non-proliferation regime.We call upon the States concerned to desist from furthernuclear testing and weaponization  and to accede to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT) without delay. We also urge the internationalcommunity to maintain vigilance to prevent the transferof their nuclear weapons-related materials  equipment andtechnology to third countries.In this context  we believe that the early entry intoforce and the securing of the universality of the CTBTshould be a high priority of the disarmament agenda. MyGovernment is proceeding with its domestic proceduresfor the ratification of the CTBT next year. At the sametime  we welcome the decision made at the Conferenceon Disarmament in Geneva last month to establish an adhoc committee on the Fissile Material Cut-offConvention. We also call upon all nuclear-weapon Statesfaithfully to comply with their obligations to undertakenuclear disarmament pursuant to article VI of the NPT.We stress once again that the Democratic People?sRepublic of Korea  as a State party to the NPT  shouldfully comply with the International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA) safeguards agreement. It should alsocarry out its obligations to freeze its nuclear activities andeventually dismantle the related facilities in accordancewith the Geneva Agreed Framework. In particular  itshould cooperate closely with the IAEA in preservingnecessary information related to its past nuclear activities.Furthermore  we urge the Democratic People?s Republicof Korea to demonstrate its sincerity in upholding theAgreed Framework by guaranteeing full transparency withregard to the recently discovered underground facilitiesnear Yongbyon.For its part  my Government will make continuedefforts  together with the United States  Japan and otherparties concerned  for smooth progress in the KoreanPeninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO)project  pursuant to the Agreed Framework. As the KEDOproject contributes to the peace and security of the region we look forward to continued political and financialsupport from the international community. We alsobelieve that both Koreas should renew their efforts toimplement the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearizationof the Korean Peninsula of 1992.13My Government shares the grave concern of theinternational community over the launching of the rocket-propelled object by the Democratic People?s Republic ofKorea on 31 August. The Democratic People?s Republic ofKorea?s ability to develop delivery means of weapons ofmass destruction poses a serious threat to peace andsecurity on the Korean Peninsula and in North-East Asia.The international community should make concerted effortsto induce the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea torefrain from conducting further missile development  testingand exporting.Chemical and biological weapons are another categoryof weapons of mass destruction that requires our seriousattention. We commend the valuable achievements of theOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons overthe last year and a half. Regrettably  a number of countriespresumed to possess chemical weapons  including theDemocratic People?s Republic of Korea  have not yetacceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention. We urgethose States to do so without delay. My delegation alsohopes for an early adoption of the Verification Protocol tothe Biological Weapons Convention.In recent years  we have seen the United Nationspeacekeeping operations expand their activities to suchareas as repatriation of refugees  demilitarization anddisbanding of armies  and the policing and monitoring ofelections. While this trend can be viewed positively  mydelegation is deeply concerned about the increasing numberof victims among civilian volunteers and United Nationspersonnel. The Republic of Korea  while serving as amember of the Security Council last year  initiated aCouncil open debate on protection for humanitarianassistance to refugees in conflict situations  which led to theadoption of a presidential statement. We hope that theSecretary-General?s report on this topic  released this week will renew the international community?s awareness of thisissue and lead to concrete follow-up measures.My delegation is deeply disturbed by the recentincrease in brutal international terrorist activities. TheRepublic of Korea will not tolerate any acts of terrorism and urges all Member States to cooperate in devisingeffective international measures to combat terrorism.On the threshold of the new millennium  theinternational community is encountering an increasinglycomplex set of challenges to peace and security. At thiscritical juncture  the Security Council needs to reform itselfto adapt to the drastically changed internationalenvironment.The Republic of Korea fully supports an expanded more representative and democratic Security Council.However  no Security Council reform package will befeasible without universal support among Member States.In this regard  we hope that the Council reform packagewill be worked out on the broadest consensus possible far exceeding the mandatory endorsement by two thirdsof the members of the General Assembly. In this context we note with appreciation the efforts of the WorkingGroup on Security Council reform to seek a realistic andpractical solution which should enjoy general agreementamong Member States.My delegation welcomes the reform efforts thatSecretary-General Kofi Annan has made since takingoffice. The Republic of Korea has consistently supportedthe Secretary-General?s reform initiatives and willcontinue to do so in our common efforts to revitalize theOrganization in the years ahead. We hope that theMillennium Assembly  to be held in the year 2000  willserve as an opportunity to crystallize the visions andstrategies needed to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.We look forward to the twenty-first century withgreat expectations. The time ahead of us will undoubtedlypose daunting challenges. Of this  I am certain. But it alsopromises a bright future if we  together  can successfullyrise to the occasion. The United Nations is a tool and aforum; it is a symbol — the best that we have — of ourjoint commitment to making the next century moresecure  more humane and more hopeful than the last one.The Republic of Korea  together with other MemberStates  stands ready to make its due contributions towardsthese lofty goals."
"92",3883,"KWT",53,1998,"It gives me great pleasure to extend to Mr. Opertti and hisfriendly country  on behalf of the State of Kuwait  oursincere congratulations on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. We areconfident that his extensive and incisive knowledge ofinternational affairs will greatly help him to guide theAssembly?s deliberations to success. Let me assure him ofour delegation?s willingness and desire to cooperate withhim in a businesslike and constructive manner in order toachieve all the objectives of this session.I also wish to express our appreciation to hispredecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for his remarkablestewardship of the previous session.Allow me take this opportunity to commend theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his tireless effortsto reform the United Nations  to restructure it  and tostreamline and revitalize it in various fields  with a view tomaking it responsive to the demands and challenges of thetwenty-first century. In this regard  we welcome thestatement made by the Secretary-General before the generaldebate  when he presented his report on the work of theOrganization. We note with satisfaction that some essentialproposals for reform presented by the Secretary-Generalhave been implemented.We hope that the reform exercise will continue withthe full backing of all Member States. The reform of theOrganization and the enhancement of its effectiveness forthe fulfilment of its objectives and the attainment of itspriorities depend in large measure on the political will ofMember States and the extent of their commitment to theirobligations under the Charter and the resolutions of itsvarious organs. We consider it unrealistic to expect theUnited Nations to deliver more while we provide less.Frankly  Kuwait feels that the success of the reformexercise hinges primarily on the availability of adequatefunding for the various mandated activities. Such fundingdepends on the payment by all Member States of theirassessed contributions to both the regular budget and thepeacekeeping budget. In this regard  I am pleased toreport that the State of Kuwait continues to fulfil itsfinancial obligations in full and on time. It is our ferventhope that this obligation will be honoured by all MemberStates of the Organization.The reform and restructuring of United Nationsorgans has become a practical necessity required for thecommon interest of all Member States. There is no doubtthat the circumstances in which the United Nations wasestablished over 50 years ago have changed  and that vastdevelopments which could not be overlooked haveoccurred at various international and regional levels.Therefore  Kuwait is in favour of restructuring theSecurity Council so that its composition and membershipreflect current political and economic realities. Thechange should also ensure greater efficiency in thedischarge of the primary responsibilities of the Council as set forth in the Charter  regarding the maintenance ofinternational peace and security.It is clear now  after five years of debate in theWorking Group on the expansion of the membership ofthe Security Council and the reform of its methods ofwork  that reaching a consensus on the optimum increasein membership is not an easy matter. Deep differencesstill exist among Member States. Nonetheless  we remainhopeful that reaching an agreement is still possible. Inthis context  we wish to emphasize the need to improvethe methods and procedures of work of the Council toensure enhanced transparency and wider involvement inthe decision-making process. The comprehensive papersubmitted by the Non-Aligned Movement on 11 March1997 to the Working Group constitutes an appropriatebasis for working out an agreement on the procedures tobe adopted and incorporated into the rules of procedure ofthe Council.As we stand at the threshold of the twenty-firstcentury  our world is witnessing the emergence of amultitude of problems and issues whose implicationstranscend national and geographical boundaries. Theirinherent dangers can threaten national and internationalsecurity. Unless curbed  such hazards will undermine theachievements made thus far in the environmental  socialand economic spheres. Among such problems — withoutbeing exhaustive — are terrorism  the arms race  narcoticdrugs  environmental degradation  poverty  human rightsviolations  massacres and genocide.17In this context  Kuwait wishes to reaffirm itscategorical denunciation and rejection of all forms ofviolence and terrorism  irrespective of their source. Wesupport all collective international efforts to confront thisphenomenon  including the apprehension and trial of theperpetrators of these crimes. Kuwait condemns the terroristacts perpetrated against the United States embassy buildingsin Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam last August and extendsheartfelt condolences and sympathy to the families of thevictims of those tragic incidents.In the area of disarmament  we welcome the progressmade thus far with regard to the Convention on theprohibition of chemical weapons  the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and theConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction.When we in Kuwait talk about landmines  we have inour minds the bitter memory of the destructive impact ofthe millions of mines planted throughout Kuwait by theinvading Iraqi forces. Those mines claimed the lives ofhundreds of innocent children  women and elderly people.It took painstaking efforts  in which many Statesparticipated  to remove those mines. Kuwait had to expendgreat efforts and vast sums on the clearance operations.We therefore call on the international community topursue its efforts to eliminate anti-personnel mines. Kuwaitalso encourages the movement towards curbing the armsrace and developing controls and rules that contribute totension reduction in all volatile and conflict-ridden regions especially the Middle East  South Asia and the Indiansubcontinent.A significant development in international efforts tocombat crimes of genocide and massacres committed duringconflicts and wars was the recent adoption of the Statute ofthe International Criminal Court in Rome last July. It is ourhope that the Court will live up to the legitimate aspirationsof the world community in trying all perpetrators of warcrimes or crimes against humanity and in serving as aneffective deterrent against serious violations of internationalhumanitarian law.On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  Kuwait calls forgreater consolidation of international efforts  to ensurewider respect for and protection of the human rightsconsecrated in the Charter of the United Nations and theUniversal Declaration. We maintain that it is the duty ofall States  irrespective of their political  economic orcultural systems  to protect and promote those rights  witha view to ensuring the dignity of the human being and hisor her rights to freedom of expression and belief.In the area of the fight against narcotic drugs  webelieve that the efforts of the United Nations and of othercompetent international institutions to combat thispernicious phenomenon  and to minimize the illicit sale trade and abuse of drugs should be supported andstrengthened. In this regard  we welcome the PoliticalDeclaration adopted at the conclusion of the twentiethspecial session of the General Assembly  held last June.We are hopeful that the steps agreed to then will betranslated into effective concrete measures to stem thetide of this phenomenon  which poses severe threats tohuman health and to the dignity and aspirations ofmillions of people and their families  as well as to thestability and independence of States.The State of Kuwait has the honour of holding thechairmanship of the current session of the GulfCooperation Council (GCC)  which was established in1981. Since its inception  the GCC has been workingsteadily to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of its peoples who share a common view of their destiny and future.Leaders of the GCC member States hold annual summitsto examine and review a wide range of issues and eventsthat concern the family of the GCC community and havean impact on regional security and stability.A major issue on the agenda of the summitconferences in this regard is the implementation by Iraqof its obligations set forth in the Security Councilresolutions relating to its invasion of the State of Kuwait.Therefore  the Gulf Cooperation Council leaders attachedgreat importance to this question in their last summit held in December 1997 in Kuwait. The final statementissued by that summit reflected a Gulf vision of the futuremodalities for establishing peace and stability in theregion. It also outlined the conditions that must be met byIraq in order to enable it to reclaim its normal positionwithin the ranks of the international community. Let mecite the following excerpt from the Gulf CooperationCouncil summit statement:“The Supreme Council reaffirms the necessity forthe Government of Iraq to implement all relevantSecurity Council resolutions without selectivity especially those relating to the elimination ofweapons of mass destruction that remain in Iraq?s18possession  the release of Kuwaiti and third countryprisoners  the return of all Kuwaiti property andcompliance with Security Council resolution 949(1994) by refraining from any act of aggression orprovocation against neighbouring States. It alsostresses that the invasion and occupation of the Stateof Kuwait by Iraq was a breach of inter-Arab andinternational treaties. Therefore  Iraq must solemnlyacknowledge that by its occupation of the State ofKuwait  it violated the Charter of the League of ArabStates  the Joint Arab Defence Treaty and the Charterof the United Nations. The Supreme Council invitesIraq to take the necessary steps to demonstrate itsgood intentions towards the State of Kuwait and otherStates in the region in both word and deed  with aview to sparing the region the horrors of anothersimilar catastrophe and to ensuring security andstability for all States of the region. It reaffirms itssupport for the United Nations Special Commission incharge of the elimination of Iraq?s weapons of massdestruction  and for its Executive Chairman  with theintention of enabling it to fulfil its mandate  andinvites the Government of Iraq to cooperate in earnestwith the Special Commission without any restrictionsor conditions. It stresses the need for Iraq to carry outall relevant Security Council resolutions with a viewto mitigating sanctions and alleviating the suffering ofthe Iraqi people  a suffering with which memberStates of the Supreme Council are sympathetic  thusprompting them to welcome the oil-for-food formulaas a means of providing food and medical drugs to thebrotherly people of Iraq. It reaffirms its firm positionthat the independence  sovereignty  unity andterritorial integrity of Iraq must be preserved.”In addition to this crystal clear position of the GulfCooperation Council countries  the Non-Aligned Movement at its recent summit in South Africa  underscored the needfor Iraq to complete its implementation of all relevantSecurity Council resolutions. The same call was madeearlier by the leaders of the Muslim countries when theyconvened their summit meeting in Tehran last December.Despite those legitimate demands and sincere calls toIraq to respond favourably to and to put into effect theresolutions of international legitimacy  Iraq still persists indisregarding those calls and in challenging the SecurityCouncil resolutions. It claims that it has carried out what itis required to do. How can such claims be reconciled withthe fact that until now we have not yet heard from Iraq anydeclaration or seen any initiative suggesting that it regretswhat it has done? In fact  convenient selectivity is thedominant feature of Iraq?s approach in addressing theresolutions and demands of international legitimacy. Themost recent crisis is perhaps a good example of theGovernment of Iraq?s procrastination and its breach ofSecurity Council resolutions and of the Memorandum ofUnderstanding it signed with the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations. Such crises  which are periodicallytriggered by the Iraqi Government in its attempts todisavow and circumvent its legal obligations  have allfailed thanks to the solid coherence and unity of positionof the members of the Security Council  which insist onfull compliance by Iraq with the relevant Security Councilresolutions. There is no doubt that all these crisesunfortunately contribute to the prolongation of thesanctions  for which the Government of Iraq alone bearsresponsibility.Accordingly  we call upon the internationalcommunity to maintain its pressure on Iraq in order toforce it to comply with all relevant resolutions ofinternational legitimacy  to release all Kuwaiti prisonersand other detainees and to account for the missingpersons. This is a long-standing humanitarian problem. Itscontinuation causes more pain and suffering for theaffected families and the people of Kuwait  who remainhopeful for the return of their loved ones. It is our hopethat this question will be resolved once and for all  inaccordance with the traditions of Islam and the provisionsof the relevant Security Council resolutions.The events of the past two decades in the ArabianGulf region have demonstrated the need for building aregional system on the basis of full and mutual respect forthe principles of sovereignty of all States  non-interference in the domestic affairs of others  non-use orthreat of use of force  the right of each State to choose itsown political  economic and social system  thesovereignty of each State over its natural resources andthe importance of resort to peaceful negotiation for theresolution of disputes which may arise between them.Having said that  and in view of Kuwait?s belief inthe inalienable rights of our sister State of the UnitedArab Emirates to the three islands of Greater Tunb Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa  we wish to reaffirm ourcommitment to and support for the final statement issuedby the Kuwait summit of Gulf Cooperation Councilmember States last December.Kuwait follows with great interest and concern therisks of the current stalemate in the Middle East peaceprocess  which may threaten it with collapse and complete19failure due to the intransigent policies of the present IsraeliGovernment  which persists in rejecting the implementationof accords concluded with the Palestinian NationalAuthority and disclaiming the operational principles andframework of the entire peace process  primarily SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and theprinciple of land for peace. This provocative policy whichis pursued by Israel?s Government not only undermines thepeace process but also creates a general sense of despairand frustration. It also destroys all efforts to build mutualconfidence between the parties concerned. It is a pushtowards confrontation  tension  violence and instabilitythroughout the region.Therefore  we demand that the Israeli Government haltits illegal policy of constructing settlements  confiscatingland and demolishing houses. Israel should also ceasetaking unilateral measures to create faits accomplis on theground inside the occupied territories. Instead  Israel shouldimplement the United Nations resolutions and fulfil itspledges and accords signed with the Palestinian Authoritywithin the framework of the peace process with a view toensuring the attainment of all legitimate political rights ofthe Palestinian people  including its right to self-determination and to the establishment of its independentstate on its national territory with Jerusalem as its capital.Here  we stress the need to halt the unabating Israelimeasures aimed at changing the physical features of thecity of Jerusalem and transforming its legal status. Wecondemn the Israeli Government?s decision last June toexpand the municipal boundaries of the Holy City. We callupon the United Nations and the international communityto fulfil their legal and political obligations in order to forceIsrael to comply with Security Council and GeneralAssembly resolutions on Jerusalem and to preserve itsArab  Muslim and religious character.In the same vein  we renew our call to the twosponsors of the peace process  especially the United States to redouble their efforts to salvage the peace process and tobring pressure to bear on Israel to resume negotiations onthe Syrian-Israeli track from the point at which theystopped  with a view to ensuring full Israeli withdrawalfrom the occupied Syrian Arab Golan  as well as itscomplete and unconditional withdrawal in accordance withSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978) from southernLebanon and the western Bekaa.Indeed  durable  just and comprehensive peace basedon United Nations resolutions and the land-for-peaceprinciple is the only guarantee for meeting the aspirationsof the peoples of the region for a new era of peacefulcoexistence and accelerated economic and socialdevelopment.The tragic situations that prevail in Somalia andAfghanistan as a result of civil and ethnic conflicts thatbrought suffering to their peoples cause us concern.Kuwait  by virtue of its historical bonds with these twocountries  reiterates its appeals to all warring parties andfactions there to put an end to acts of violence andsenseless bloodshed. We call upon them to respondimmediately to regional and international appeals andinitiatives for dialogue and negotiation in order to resolvetheir differences and to achieve overall nationalreconciliation. This would allow them to channel theirpotentialities towards the goals of development and thereconstruction of what these conflicts have destroyed.In condemning the killing of the Iranian diplomatsin Afghanistan  Kuwait would like to extend its sincerecondolences to the people and the Government of theIslamic Republic of Iran and to the families of the victimsof this tragic incident.We appeal to both the Islamic Republic of Iran andAfghanistan to be calm  exercise self-restraint and resolvetheir disputes through dialogue and negotiation instead ofconfrontation. While we appreciate the Government ofIran?s ability to handle the crisis in a way that will sparethe two Muslim peoples the dire consequences of a warwhose consequences we cannot predict  Kuwait supportsthe endeavours of the Security Council to achieve peacein the area.On the international plane  while we applaud theinternational efforts to ensure full and strictimplementation of the Dayton accords to bring aboutpeace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina  we regretthe aggressive practices of the Serb forces  including thesystematic uprooting and “ethnic cleansing” of theMuslim population in the province of Kosovo. We urgethe international community to maintain its efforts to putan end to these inhumane practices in order to ensure theright of the native population of that province to a life ofdignity and freedom.In Africa  we are witnessing with deep regret thecontinuation of conflicts and civil wars in several States.These hostilities jeopardize the security and stability ofmany African States and strain their much neededenergies and resources. Kuwait supports the efforts of theinternational community to bring about peace and security20and to provide the means that help the African peoples andStates to achieve their aspirations for economicdevelopment and to overcome the problems and difficultiesthat they face in various fields. We also welcome the roleplayed by the Security Council in examining the situationin the African continent on a periodic basis. Furthermore we commend President Nelson Mandela for the role that heassumed in this regard as Chairman of the Non-AlignedMovement.The world economic scene is currently going throughsevere turbulence and turmoil that have touched off andworsened economic and social crises in many countries especially the developing ones. The major threat to theworld economy is no longer represented by inflation  but byrecession  stagnation and unemployment. Therefore  we callfor concerted international action to redress thosedifficulties  which have adverse implications for everybody.National plans and programmes capable of addressing theunderlying causes of these volatile situations should beestablished  and help with economic aid to the affectedStates should be forthcoming from international monetaryinstitutions in order to help them rectify their economicsystems and restore their vitality.In this regard  Kuwait  for its part  continued toprovide economic assistance by financing manydevelopment projects in the developing countries throughthe Kuwait fund for development  despite the adverseimpact on our economy of depressed oil prices  whichplummeted this year to their lowest levels.Adherence to the noble goals and principles of theUnited Nations Charter  action in accordance with itsprovisions and the common endeavour to promote andbolster them are essential for strengthening the UnitedNations capabilities for facing the challenges of the nextcentury. This will also help us in the crystallization of anew world order in which dialogue and cooperation canprevail  and in which conflicts and hostilities woulddisappear. It would also encourage active participation byall in strengthening the pillars of peace and stability  inconsolidating all efforts for the enrichment of humancivilization and in the fulfilment of the aspirations of allpeoples for peace  security  freedom and justice."
"93",3929,"LAO",53,1998,"First of all  I should like to extend mywarmest congratulations to Mr. Didier Opertti on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the fifty-third sessionof the General Assembly. His recognized skills as a veterandiplomat and his extensive knowledge of internationalaffairs augur well for the success of our deliberations.As we assure him of our complete cooperation  mydelegation would like to wish him every possible success.I should like also to avail myself of this opportunity to paytribute to Mr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of ourOrganization  for the crucial role that he has played in thepreservation of peace and the promotion of socio-economicdevelopment throughout the world. We are extremelygrateful to him for the laudable efforts he has made in thefirst two difficult years of his term.In the past year  the world situation has continued toundergo changes that are more profound and complex thanin the preceding years. World peace continues to be justas fragile. In various regions of the world  civil wars conflicts among States  border disputes and ethnic  tribaland religious confrontations continue to take place. Someof these events offer no glimmer of abatement  whileothers have been deliberately provoked against thesovereignty of other States. In the face of this situation it is important for the international community  in itsrespect for the Charter of the United Nations  to focus itsenergies and do its utmost to reduce tensions and assistthe countries concerned in resolving their problems bymeans of negotiations  thus favouring the current generaltrend towards international cooperation for development.On the eve of the third millennium  States and peoplesthroughout the world should together endeavour to lay theappropriate solid foundations to construct a new era ofrelations based on peace  social justice and equality.In certain regions of Europe  there has been aresurgence of deadly ethnic conflicts  resulting inenormous losses in human lives and material property.While coming out in favour of the inviolability ofinternationally recognized borders  we should likesincerely to appeal to the countries involved to showrestraint and resolve their conflicts through dialogue.In Africa  we are still witnessing ethnicconfrontation  civil war and border conflicts that continuegravely to threaten peace  stability and cooperation. Inview of the great suffering that the victimized peoples ofcertain countries of the region must ensure  theinternational community must render its support andassistance to the countries concerned in their efforts toresolve their problems by peaceful means and as soon aspossible.In the Caribbean  an atmosphere of peace andcooperation continues to prevail. In this context  weprofoundly regret that the 30-year-plus economic commercial and financial blockade imposed on theRepublic of Cuba by the United States of America hasnot yet been lifted. In the interest of regional and worldpeace as well as in the interest of both the Cuban andAmerican people  it is our hope that the two countriesconcerned will commit themselves to reasonablenegotiations so as to resolve their dispute as soon aspossible in conformity with the general trend obtainingthroughout the world.In the Middle East  the situation appears tense. Thepeace process begun following the signature by thePalestine Liberation Organization and Israel of the13Washington Accords of 1993 has run up against gravedifficulties in the past two years in the wake of theestablishments of new settlements in Har Homa in EastJerusalem and of other unilateral measures that have beentaken. In our view  it is imperative for the parties involvedimmediately to put an end to unilateral measures andspeedily to restore a climate of mutual trust and continueseriously in their negotiations to achieve a generalsettlement based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)and 338 (1973) and other relevant General Assemblyresolutions in order to contribute to the restoration of peace security and cooperation in this very delicate region of theworld.On the Korean peninsula in general we are witnessinga reduction in tension. Contacts and talks among the partiesconcerned are continuing in a spirit of respect for mutualinterests. While welcoming the efforts deployed  theGovernment and people of the Lao Peopleâs DemocraticRepublic would like to reiterate their sincere support for theprofound aspirations of the Korean people to live in peaceand to achieve the peaceful reunification of their cherishedhomeland.In South-East Asia multifaceted beneficial cooperationamong States is continuing under good conditions.Nevertheless  in the wake of the financial crisis thatoccurred more than a year ago  the countries of the regionare now going through unprecedented grave economicdifficulties. But thanks mainly to national efforts andregional and international cooperation  these countries are through adjustment programmes  engaged in a process ofprofound economic restructuring in order to get back ontrack. The international community as a whole has beencalled upon to support them actively  particularly thosemost affected.Another important event that has characterized ourregion was the holding last July of general elections inCambodia  the results of which have been recognized andapproved by the international community. As a nearbyneighbour  the Lao Peopleâs Democratic Republic wouldlike to express the hope that the Cambodian partiesconcerned will speedily form a coalition Governmentwhich  in accordance with the Constitution  will be headedby a prime minister from the party that has been elected bymajority which would contribute to the establishment ofnational concord in Cambodia and the promotion of peaceand stability in the region.In the Lao Peopleâs Democratic Republic  socio-political stability continues to be securely guaranteed. Inaccordance with the Constitution  national legislativeelections took place on 21 December 1997. The newNational Assembly â€” the Fourth Legislature â€” has beenset up and is made up of 99 members  including 21women  representing the three major ethnic groups of thecountry.In the economic sphere  the implementation of arecovery policy based on market mechanisms hasproduced generally satisfactory results. However  themonetary crisis that has severely afflicted all of South-East Asia and even beyond for more than a year hasconsiderably affected our economy. But  resolutely basingpolicies on the principle of self-reliance and enjoyingexternal cooperation  the Lao Government has mobilizedall of its capacity in human  intellectual  natural andmaterial resources to reduce to the minimum the adverseeffects of this crisis on our society and to achievenormalization.While some can gain in this era of globalization andeconomic liberalization  the fact is that most developingcountries  particularly the least developed  have beenlargely marginalized and exposed to enormous difficultiesand risks. In this context  the developed countries must doeverything possible to render the necessary assistance tothese countries so that they might catch up in theirlagging development and have a share in the progress ofthe times.Drug abuse continues to figure prominently on theinternational agenda. In this connection  the Governmentof the Lao Peopleâs Democratic Republic has taken thenecessary measures with a view to reducing productionand banning the illicit trafficking in drugs  opium inparticular. The results of these measures are satisfactory.However  the illegal introduction of synthetic drugs fromabroad is still our main concern. In this connection  wewelcome the unanimous adoption by the GeneralAssembly at its twentieth special session of the PoliticalDeclaration and a programme of action  and we expressthe hope that the international community as a whole willmobilize itself and marshall the necessary financialresources to implement this ambitious programme.The question of human rights is no less important inmy country. Thus  on the occasion of the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  my Government has officially announced theestablishment of a national committee to commemoratethis day solemnly on a wide scale with the sole purposeof publicizing the contents of the Declaration among the14multi-ethnic Lao people and to promote harmony andmutual respect in our society.The world today is confronted with numerouschallenges. World peace remains fragile. Under-development  poverty  hunger and disease are among thepriority problems that must be resolved. With the purposeof consolidating peace and achieving developmentthroughout the world  the United Nations  our onlyuniversal multilateral forum  must make an importantcontribution. To be able to fulfil its mission in this new era our Organization needs to restructure itself or to reorganizeitself to be more effective.In this connection  we would like to express our greatappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for thereform initiatives he presented last year. Of course  thesereforms which must  inter alia  stress the strengthening therole of the Organization and the promotion of development represent an ongoing and difficult process. But in order forthem to succeed  a solid financial basis must be assured. Inthat vein  it is high time that  in conformity with the UnitedNations Charter  all the Member States  particularly themain contributors  fulfil their financial commitments in fulland on time. In so doing  we are giving the incipientreforms a chance  and in the final analysis we would beinfusing energy into our Organization so that it coulddischarge its lofty mission as it confronts the challenges ofour times."
"94",3972,"LBN",53,1998,"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Mr. Opertti onhis election as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session. I would also like to commend theefforts of his predecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko whom we recently welcomed to our country.I should also like to place on record our appreciationto the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. He has beenworking tirelessly to promote the authority of the UnitedNations  advocating respect for the internationallegitimacy for which it stands  especially in the area offinding peaceful solutions to the explosive conflicts thatare raging in some parts of the world. The internationalcommunity has recognized his great achievement when hesucceeded a few months ago in defusing an ominousmilitary confrontation in the Arab Gulf region. We hopethat this will be followed by similar successes in othervolatile situations plaguing different parts of the world.The hopes that are pinned on the United Nationsassume a special meaning at this session  which coincideswith the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights  an instrument which Lebanonparticipated in framing. Today  human rights are a majorpillar of the new world order. Respect for human rightshas become the yardstick by which the democracypractised in countries is judged. Compliance with theprovisions of the Declaration under all circumstances andconditions guarantees not only the peace  security andstability of societies but also the establishment of relationsof cooperation and understanding among States.The United Nations is duty-bound to enhance itsindependence since it was liberated from the impact ofthe cold war and of the bipolarity which held sway overinternational relations in the post-Second World War era.Today  it is called upon to reactivate its role in makingand consolidating peace. This task can be achievedprimarily by addressing the root causes of conflicts through preventive diplomacy and through various18technical and development assistance programmes invarious fields.It is important here to refer to the fact thatinternational institutions have an important role to play inproviding the developing countries with the necessarytechnical assistance. Such assistance will enable them totake advantage of the accelerated pace of globalization inthe field of trade and finance. It will also give thesecountries sufficient time to adapt and get ready to face thenew challenges. This will help many developing countriesavoid the negative effects of surging globalization  giventhe inadequacy of their production capabilities and theabsence of a competitive edge. In this regard  Lebanon iseffectively contributing to the establishment of a free tradezone specifically in the Arab region while continuing itscommitment to the establishment of trade liberalizationworldwide.On the eve of the twenty-first century  the UnitedNations role requires it to fulfil the tasks of reform andstreamlining so that it can keep up with the fast pace ofinternational relations. Thus the reform measures initiatedby the Secretary-General must be completed. Furthermore the reform of the working methods and streamlining of theSecurity Council to increase its membership and make itmore representative should also be completed. Oncereformed  different States  particularly small States  will beenabled to participate in the decision-making processrelevant to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity.We commend the efforts that went into theestablishment of the International Criminal Court whoseStatute was recently adopted in Rome. Lebanon supportsthe establishment of the Court and is determined to studyits Statute positively.More than ever before  the international community iscalled upon to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes especially in extremely sensitive regions of the world. Weneed also to address the root causes of the problems andthereby to defuse the crises before they turn into full-scaleconflagrations.The time has come to solve pending problems particularly those of the Middle East region. For instance a settlement must be found to the question of the threeislands in the Gulf disputed by the United Arab Emiratesand Iran. Such a settlement should restore the disputedislands to their rightful owners and thus promote peace andstability among the States and the peoples of the region.If we are truly interested in the promotion ofregional and international peace and security  we mustwork in all seriousness to build a world free fromweapons of mass destruction. In this context  we aspireand call for the establishment of a zone free from nuclearand other weapons of mass destruction in the MiddleEast.Five years ago  I was privileged to stand here beforethe General Assembly to speak about Lebanon and aboutits commitment to a just and comprehensive peace. Fromthis very rostrum  I declared that Lebanon is committedto the principles of democracy  liberty and human rights and that it has succeeded in safeguarding these principleseven through its darkest moments.In this context  reference should be made toLebanon?s firm position of condemning terrorism in all itsforms and manifestations including political  cultural andeconomic. We condemn terrorism whether sponsored byStates or by individuals. Lebanon condemns attacksagainst civilians  embassies and diplomatic missions plane hijacking and any other act that jeopardizes thelives and property of civilians. However  we must stressthe importance of distinguishing between terrorism andpeoples? rights to resist the forces of foreign occupationin accordance with the Charter of the United Nations andin its successive resolutions adopted by the internationalOrganization and other fora  especially the Declaration ofthe Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the UnitedNations.Lebanon is fully committed to the role of the UnitedNations and is keen on furthering this role and onsafeguarding the equilibrium and integrity of internationalrelations. We therefore believe that it is important for allStates  large and small  to commit to the principles ofinternational legitimacy and refrain from undertakingunilateral measures that are driven solely by narrowinterests and dictated by expediency.Today  as we reiterate these constant positions ofprinciple  we can point with confidence to the originalityof our experience in coexistence  which is based onmoderation and tolerance  and our firm belief in bothdeserves to be a living model that should be emulatedwhenever solutions are sought to the problems of societiesafflicted with wars  racial or factional strife all over theworld. This is particularly true of societies that are tryingto restore civil peace as part of their post-conflict peace-building efforts.19Lebanon  with an open and creative society  a societythat is Arab by identity and orientation  has remained unitedin territory  population and institutions; Lebanon hasremained a vibrant oasis of goodwill and beneficialinteraction.As is well known  Lebanon has for the past few yearsembarked on a reconstruction plan following a protracteddevastating war. It has been tirelessly working to regain theprominent cultural and economic position it once held in itsregion and in the world  depending on God Almighty  thenon the will and resourcefulness of its own citizens and onthe support of its brothers and the contributions of itsfriends all over the world.Throughout this period of reconstruction  Lebanonfaced difficult circumstances caused first and foremost bythe continued Israeli occupation of parts of its territoriesand by the continuity of its devastating attacks against itsvillages and peaceful citizens. These attacks have claimedthe lives of many innocent civilians  men  women andchildren  and wounded many many more. I am confidentthat the international community still remembers very wellthe Qana massacre perpetrated by Israel in 1996.Lebanon has faced a critical stage of its historythrough the past few years while implementing thereconstruction plans. The only parallel to the intensity ofthis stage is the determination of the Lebanese people toface the various challenges on more than one front.Lebanon has succeeded in regaining the world?s confidencein its ability to play once more a distinguished and shiningrole in the cultural  economic  commercial and financialfields. Beirut is back to its position as the crossroads ofvarious cultures and civilizations  a fact attested to by themany conferences and the regional and internationalmeetings that were convened there. The United Nationsbuilding that Lebanon has recently completed as the focalpoint for United Nations activities in Lebanon and in theregion is proof  if any was needed  of Lebanon?s keeninterest in the return of international organizations to Beirut.As an indication of international confidence in ourperformance  the world financial markets traded in treasurybonds issued by the Lebanese Government and institutionsof the private sector. This was made possible by thecooperation between the Lebanese financial institutions andtheir international counterparts. It is a demonstration of theconfidence that the world has in the present and future ofthe national economy and of the confidence of the Lebanesethemselves in their country and its future.But to date  Israel has not wanted to meet itscommitments; it has not done what it promised to thePalestinians and to the international community; it doesnot want to resume the negotiations with Lebanon andwith Syria from the point at which they left off.We invite the institutions of the internationalcommunity to play a more effective role in securingcompliance with the resolutions of internationallegitimacy. They must bring the necessary pressure tobear on the aggressor to remove the causes of this conflictand lay the foundations of a just and comprehensivepeace.Israel cannot merely pay lip service to peace andexpect to be considered a truly peace-loving State.Talking about peace is one thing; Israel?s actions on theground are another. Israel?s claim that it is a weakcountry surrounded by hostile neighbours is one thing;Israel?s military might  based on weapons of massdestruction  nuclear weapons and state-of-the-art Westernweaponry  is another. Israel has all those weapons and isthe mightiest Power in the Middle East. But it does notwant to implement or respect the resolutions ofinternational legitimacy.We went to the Madrid Peace Conference with theother Arab parties sincerely hoping to achieve a just permanent and comprehensive peace that would end thecontinued cycle of violence that has engulfed our regionover the past 50 years. The negotiations on the Palestiniantrack remain in a vicious circle  and the repercussions ofIsraeli intransigence could very well shatter our hopes forpeace; the negotiations on the Lebanese and Syrian trackshave come to a complete standstill as a result of theintransigent position of the Israeli Government.We reaffirm our permanent commitment to the nobleobjective of achieving peace. We have previouslydeclared that the accomplishment of this goal lies in thefull  immediate and unconditional implementation ofUnited Nations resolutions. On this occasion  we reiterateour total rejection of any settlement of Palestinianrefugees in Lebanon. We call upon the internationalcommunity to increase its voluntary contributions to theUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for PalestineRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) pending theimplementation of international resolutions relative torefugees  particularly resolution 194 (III).As we repeat our commitment to a just comprehensive and permanent peace  we declare that we20in Lebanon and in Syria are ready to resume thenegotiations from where they were stopped. We are readyto sign a peace treaty with Israel within three months  onthe condition that it withdraws from the South  from theWest Beqaa  and from the Syrian Golan to the lines of 4June 1967. Peace negotiations aimed at achieving a just andcomprehensive peace — the peace that we alwaysproclaimed our desire to achieve — can only beaccomplished on the basis of the Madrid terms of reference in accordance with the principle of land for peace. Theseshould be pursued on two parallel  inseparable tracks withIsrael: the Lebanese negotiation track and the Syriannegotiation track.The interdependence of the twin tracks was a strategicdecision dictated by the supreme interests of both Lebanonand Syria. This interdependence enhances the prospects ofa just  permanent and comprehensive peace. We havepreviously declared  and we repeat today before thisassembly of nations  that neither Lebanon nor Syria willsign a separate peace agreement with Israel. Lebanon andSyria are committed to the resolutions of internationallegitimacy. We continue to be committed to peace as astrategic choice.Peace as we see it is a peace built on justice  a peacethat will restore usurped rights to their rightful owners fullyand without diminution. Any initiatives that ignore theseprinciples and bases are nothing more than manoeuvrespredestined to failure. They will only prolong the conflictwith all that this implies in terms of squandering the humanand economic resources of all concerned. They will furtherpostpone the permanent  just and comprehensive peacewhich we still uphold and aspire to. To us  this will alwaysbe the only viable means to achieve the prosperity andprogress of our people and of the other peoples of theregion.The voices that were recently raised calling for theestablishment of military alliances in the region on thepretext of confronting certain trends of thought can only beseen as attempts to bring the region back to the atmosphereof alliances and confrontation. Time and again  history hasproven these to be harmful to the interests of peoples. Theycan only lead to negative results that will obstruct the peaceprocess.So long as the Israeli occupation and assaults againstour people continue  we shall continue to uphold our rightto resist occupation and to use all legitimate means towhich peoples who have had to endure the injustices andevils of occupation have resorted previously. The Lebaneseresistance in southern Lebanon and the West Beqaa is inpursuit of a legitimate right supported and endorsed bythe entire Lebanese people. The Lebanese people who like other peoples whose lands have been occupied  havebeen resisting occupation  and appeal to the internationalcommunity to spare no effort in helping to secure therelease of its citizens who are incarcerated in Israeliprisons and in detention camps under Israeli control in theoccupied Lebanese territories. Hundreds of our sons havebeen languishing in Israeli jails and detention camps foryears. Some have already served the prison sentenceshanded down by Israeli courts  yet are still in custody forreasons unknown to anyone. Others have been in custodyfor years but have not yet been arraigned. Theirincarceration continues under an arbitrary measure thatIsrael calls “administrative detention”.We have been trying to secure the release of allLebanese detainees from Israeli jails with the assistanceof friendly and brotherly States and with the activeinvolvement of the International Committee of the RedCross. We appeal to the United Nations and to otherinternational humanitarian agencies to give this mattertheir utmost attention. We also call upon them to pleadwith Israel to improve the living conditions of theseprisoners  who live in unbearable  inhumanecircumstances that run counter to international laws andconventions.Lebanon finds itself today twice victimized. On theone hand  it has to endure continued devastating attacksby Israel  attacks that can be justified only under onerubric: Israel?s stubborn clinging to its occupation and tothe flimsy pretext of security. On the other hand  Lebanonsees how the international community is incapable ofdoing what it takes to restore its legitimate rights throughcompliance with the just resolutions adopted by thisinternational Organization  in particular Security Councilresolution 425 (1978)  which calls for unconditionalIsraeli withdrawal from the Lebanese territories. Lebanon which for 50 years has dearly paid for the establishmentof Israel  suffers from the double standards which have sofar obstructed the implementation of Security Councilresolution 425 (1978).The United Nations  which has made continuousefforts  and whose peacekeeping forces have made theultimate sacrifice  in the South  remains the best witnessto the indiscriminate nature and ferocity of the Israeliattacks against the Lebanese. The United Nationspeacekeeping forces have repeatedly been the direct targetof Israeli bombardment  including the 1996 shelling of the21headquarters of a battalion of the United Nations InterimForce in Lebanon  in Qana  which was the scene of aheinous massacre in which scores of Lebanese lost theirlives. Here we would like to pay tribute to the fallensoldiers of the United Nations who have died in Lebanon victims of Israeli acts of aggression. Lebanon considersthem to be its martyrs too. From this rostrum  we honourtheir memory. We salute each and every member of theUnited Nations peacekeeping Force stationed in Lebanon.We express special thanks and appreciation to the friendlyStates that have contributed troops to that Force. On theoccasion of the departure of the Norwegian battalion thathas worked in Lebanon for over two decades  allow me toexpress  on behalf of the people and the Government ofLebanon  our thanks and gratitude to the Norwegian peopleand Government for their enduring commitment to andparticipation in the Force. Many members of the Norwegianbattalion sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.Lebanon has the right to demand that the internationalcommunity and the United Nations  which representsinternational legitimacy  should make every effort to secureIsrael?s compliance with international resolutions and itswithdrawal from its territories.Lebanon  which believes in peace  will work with itsbrothers to consolidate this peace and make it a foundationfor a new life in the Middle East region. Achieving thisnoble objective will not only translate just resolutions intotangible action  but it will also further the confidence ofsmall States and nations in an authority that will guaranteetheir rights  their very existence and their future.In conclusion  I would like to address the Israelipeople to tell them that the Arabs  specifically Lebanon andSyria  have taken a strategic decision  namely the peaceoption  which is the difficult choice. This is the strategicoption which we uphold and for which we work in theinterest of the future of our nation and that of our children.For peace to be realized  Israel also has to follow suit forthe sake of the future of its children. Peace requires courageand a broad vision of the future. Lebanon and Syria havemade their choice. Will Israel make the same choice?"
"95",4019,"LBR",53,1998,"I bring the Assemblygreetings from President Charles Taylor and theGovernment and the people of Liberia.On behalf of the delegation of Liberia and in myown name  I convey my sincere congratulations toMr. Opertti on his assumption of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. His unanimouselection to this high office is a credit not only to him butalso to his esteemed country. I assure him of mydelegation?s fullest support and cooperation and wish himevery success in the discharge of his duties.I should like also to register my delegation?sappreciation to the President?s distinguished predecessor Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  the then Minister for ForeignAffairs of Ukraine  for the able manner in which heconducted the work of the fifty-second session. The manysuccesses achieved during his tenure of office  especiallyin the reform of this Organization  attest to his diplomaticskills and his understanding of the problems whichconfront the Organization and our determined efforts tobuild a more just and humane international order that isresponsive to the legitimate aspirations of all mankind.We offer special thanks to our Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his unrelenting pursuit of theimplementation of the mandates entrusted to him by theAssembly. My delegation also commends him for hisefforts aimed at the successful execution of theadministrative reforms of the Secretariat  and theimportant focus he has placed on development peacemaking and peace-building efforts  especially inAfrica  as the most assured basis for sustainabledevelopment.The Secretary-General?s report (A/52/871) on thecauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace andsustainable development in Africa provides an in-depthanalysis of the social and economic ills of the Continent which was thoroughly discussed at the ministerial meetingof the Security Council. We fully agree with his assertionthat while African Governments must ultimately be heldresponsible for the problems confronting their countries meaningful steps must be taken by this Organization to lendsupport to national measures aimed at alleviating theseproblems.In this connection  it is notable that on 6 October1998  the United Nations will observe the fiftiethanniversary of the establishment of its peacekeepingoperations. Africa continues to benefit from the UnitedNations peacekeeping operations aimed at the resolution ofconflicts on the continent pursuant to Chapter VIII of theCharter. While welcoming this cooperation  Liberia callsupon the Security Council to employ impartiality and non-selectivity in the execution of its primary role ofmaintaining international peace and security.The international political situation continues to becharacterized by sustained efforts aimed at the maintenanceof international peace and security. While there has been nomajor eruption of military confrontation between States intra-State conflicts and civil wars in Angola  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Guinea-Bissau  theSudan and Kosovo  and the territorial dispute betweenEthiopia and Eritrea have claimed the attention of regionaland subregional organizations such as the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC)  the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)  the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  the European Unionand the Organization of African Unity (OAU).These organizations and regional bodies areendeavouring  with the complementary support of theUnited Nations  to seek negotiated peaceful solutions and tominimize the humanitarian crises  refugee flows andinternal displacement caused by conflicts and wars.With regard to the Middle East  my delegation isdeeply concerned about the lack of progress  particularly inconnection with the Madrid Conference and the Osloaccords. We are of the view that new initiatives should beundertaken to restart the peace process  focusing on theunderstanding reached by the parties. Liberia will supportrenewed efforts by the international community that seekto bring the volatile situation in that region to a fair andequitable conclusion.The rise in acts of terrorism threatens theindependence  sovereignty  freedom  economic and socialdevelopment of all States. It cannot be overemphasizedthat terrorism has no justification as a means to solvepolitical differences. Therefore  the Government ofLiberia strongly condemns the bombings in Dar-es-Salaam  Tanzania and Nairobi  Kenya. It is imperativethat concerted actions be taken to combat thisunwholesome phenomenon which has no bounds. Liberiais in accord with the proposal of President HosniMubarak of Egypt for the convening of an internationalconference on terrorism to deliberate on the issue.The world is faced with the frightening prospect ofan increase in the number of States with nuclearcapability  as well as the proliferation of conventionalweapons. We therefore call for more States to accede tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT). There is an urgent need to curtail the traffickingin small arms and to promote greater transparency inarms transfers.The scourge of the worldwide drug problemnecessitated the convening of the drug summit in NewYork in June of this year. It is a source of concern thatdrug sales have overtaken trade in other commodities  andthe money value of this illegal act has reached over $400billion annually. My Government reaffirms itscommitment to tackling the drug problem within itsborders and to cooperating at the regional andinternational levels in keeping with the PoliticalDeclaration and the guiding principles outlined at theconclusion of the summit.The 1990s have been declared an era ofglobalization. However  the rapid growth of internationaltrade and financial flows has affected most economies inprofound ways. Globalization threatens the weak andvulnerable by marginalizing them in the global economicsystem.For most developing countries  the debt overhangand unequal participation in the regulation of commoditypricing  declining official development assistance andcapital flows are perennial problems that hamper theireconomic development and integration into the world2economy. My delegation therefore joins in the call for theindustrialized countries to bring about equity in theregulatory framework for the financial and exchangemarkets.In this connection  Liberia reaffirms its support for theposition of the Non-Aligned Movement summit  heldrecently in Durban  South Africa  that developed countriesbe urged to accelerate the review of the world financialsystem  thus ensuring that capital flows were supportive ofexpansion in trade  employment and development. Inaddition  there is the need to boost development aid fromWestern countries and to remove restrictive conditionslinked to receiving international assistance.In particular  my Government welcomes the call byPresident William Clinton of the United States of Americafor a meeting in Washington  D.C.  in mid-October of thisyear  of finance ministers and central bank governors fromnations of the G-7 and emerging economies to debate stepsto shore up the tottering global financial system. Hisreaffirmation of this proposal  as well as his pledge madeto this Assembly on 21 September last  to forge apartnership with Africa  deserves our commendation andsupport. Also  we cannot agree more with the Secretary-General that the United Nations should be included in thediscussion. Its participation will give more internationalcredibility to the decisions that would emerge from themeeting.Even though recent indicators point to improvement inthe economies of several African countries  the vastmajority continue to experience negative growth. Thelargest number of least developed countries are in Africa and the crippling effects of the heavy external debt anddecline in investment and financial flows have been majorcontributors to the poor economic performance of thesecountries. There is a need for concerted international actionto remedy this state of affairs. The United Nations system-wide support for the development of Africa is a step in theright direction.My delegation welcomes the recent decision of thesubstantive session of the Economic and Social Council held in July of this year  and the Council?s ministerialcommuniqué on market access for exports from leastdeveloped countries  as well as capacity-building and in-service infrastructure development. These decisions deservefull support and should be implemented by Member States.In this connection  the important initiative taken by theGovernment of Japan  a prominent member of the G-7  tourgently address Africa?s development has the highestcommendation of my Government and the appreciation ofall African States. My delegation looks forward toactively participating in the important ministerial meetingwhich will be convened in Tokyo next month on Africa?seconomic recovery. Moreover  this initiative deserves thewholehearted support of Member States of thisOrganization  particularly the developed countries.My delegation notes with satisfaction the efforts bythe United Nations to harmonize the issues ofdevelopment and the environment. With respect to theenvironment  the decision reached on Agenda 21 duringthe 1992 Rio Conference is the most comprehensive effortundertaken by the international community to raiseawareness of the degradation of the environment and theneed to reverse the negative trend. We trust that the issueof the environment will remain a priority on the globalagenda.One important and unquestionable achievement forour Organization to celebrate is the great improvement inthe universal character of the Organization. Nevertheless more efforts must be deployed to ensure that everycountry becomes a member of this Organization. Mydelegation believes that in that regard  the exceptionalsituation of the Republic of China on Taiwan must beexamined with a view to the unification of the Chinesepeople based on their own will and decision. However we also believe that it is the responsibility of thisOrganization to provide the impetus for the unification ofthe two Chinas. History is replete with examples of themembership in this Organization of divided countries where unification was peacefully settled under the aegisof the United Nations. We have confidence in the abilityof the United Nations to allow history to be repeated ona similar matter of grave importance to this Organization.In the interest of equity and the maintenance of regionalpeace and security  my country calls for the parallelrepresentation in the United Nations of the People?sRepublic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan.The matter of reform is one that needs nojustification. It is an imperative for the continuedrelevance of the United Nations. An Organization madeup of 185 Member States must  by its nature  allow fairplay and democracy to prevail  and not the rule ofweighted influence. The tenets of the United NationsCharter do not submit to the principle of “might makesright”  but to the enlightened principles of internationallaw which emerge from the objective need for peacefulcoexistence. Unless the powerful States recognize this3imperative  the international system will move towardsinternational anarchy rather than towards a more humane peaceful and stable world order.These reforms will be meaningless unless parallelreforms can be achieved within the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  the very essence of weighted and undemocraticglobal influence.On the question of increase in the membership of theSecurity Council  Liberia reaffirms its support for anincrease for Africa and other under-represented regions onthe basis of equitable geographical representation  consistentwith the decisions of the Organization of African Unity andthe Non-Aligned Movement.During the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly  it was my honour to read the prepared text ofMr. Charles Taylor  President of the Republic of Liberia  tothis Assembly. At that time  only two months had passedsince his assumption of the leadership of Liberia  followingseven years of civil war and the holding of democraticelections in the country.Since then  the Government has undertaken measurestowards the rebuilding of the country  nationalreconciliation  rehabilitation  repatriation and resettlement.In light of this  from 19 July to 12 August 1998  thepeople of Liberia participated in a national conference todeliberate on the future of Liberia under the theme “Vision2024”. This historic undertaking not only reaffirmedPresident Taylor?s commitment to participatory democracybut also afforded a unique opportunity for Liberians athome and abroad to freely deliberate on and proposesolutions for the building of a new Liberia.At the conclusion of the conference  a commissionwas established and given the responsibility to seek fullimplementation of the decisions reached. Those decisionsranged from decentralization of the Government to theenactment of legislation covering all facets of the society.My Government has attached high priority to theimplementation of the decisions of the national conference since it has helped produce an agenda which complementsthat of the Government and identifies issues and measuresas well as courses of action that could be adopted for thestability and development of Liberia.President Taylor is aware that the key to Liberia?sstability and development lies in fostering genuinereconciliation among Liberians. A human rightscommission established since the inception of theGovernment continues to function. The protection ofhuman rights will remain one of the cornerstones ofLiberia?s domestic policy. This is why my Governmenthas now undertaken legislative action to ratify and accedeto all human rights instruments as a concrete attestationof our commitment to promote and protect human rightsin Liberia.Convinced that democracy is indispensable fordevelopment  the Government has also undertakenmeasures to realize its intention to build institutions toconsolidate the democratic process in the country. Wehave encouraged the continued existence and growth ofthe 13 political parties that participated in the lastelections. We hold regular consultations with these partiesconcerning national issues. We believe that these effortsare necessary for the dynamic development of a modernLiberia. Meanwhile  international support remains anecessity in order for Liberia to find its way forward andconsolidate the gains made by the return to civilian constitutional rule.Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter vests theSecurity Council with the authority to decide whatmeasures may be taken to maintain or restoreinternational peace and security  following a determinationof the existence of any threat to peace  breach of thepeace or act of aggression.In a number of cases  the imposition of a sanctionsregime or embargo by the Council has yielded  withminimal collateral harm  the results for which punitivemeasures were authorized. However  in other cases sanctions have led to grave and intolerable humanitariancrises which have deprived large numbers of innocent andvulnerable persons  mainly women and children  of theirmost basic needs  while not achieving their intendedobjectives.Within this context  the Government of Liberiabelieves that any sanctions regime should clearly definethe punitive measure  its specific target  a definite time-frame and exemptions to mitigate the unintended harmfulconsequences for the whole population of a given countryand those of contiguous States.In 1992  during Liberia?s civil war  the ECOWASsubregional grouping imposed an arms embargo onLiberia as a means to facilitate the peace process andreduce the level of violence. ECOWAS also further4appealed to the Security Council to facilitate the universalapplication of the embargo  an appeal the Security Councilheeded positively by adopting a resolution imposing anarms embargo on Liberia.By 1997  the Liberian civil war was brought to an endthrough the process of a negotiated political settlement disarmament  demobilization and the holding of free andfair democratic elections. After the inauguration of theelected and constitutional Government  ECOWAS lifted allsanctions and embargoes imposed against Liberia and calledupon the international community to do the same.The Government of Liberia  since its assumption ofoffice  has repeatedly called upon the Security Council tolift the arms embargo  an appeal that has fallen on deafears. The Liberian Government has a constitutionalresponsibility and a sovereign right to defend  protect andpreserve the independence and territorial integrity of theRepublic.We strongly believe that the arms embargo currentlyin force against Liberia is patently unfair since it is open-ended and provides no criteria for the lifting of theembargo  as has been the procedure in other  similar cases.Moreover  the intent and purpose of the 1992 arms embargohave been achieved by the peaceful resolution of theLiberian civil crisis through the holding of democraticelections in Liberia and the installation of the Governmentheaded by President Charles Taylor on 2 August 1997.As a responsible member of the internationalcommunity  Liberia would accede to the wishes of theSecurity Council if it were decided that there wasjustification for the maintenance of sanctions against Liberiabased on concrete facts or a violation of international lawor covenants. However  to do so under a sanctions regimethat no longer has validity is unwarranted and inimical tothe interests of the country.The Government of Liberia requests that the SecurityCouncil take cognizance of Liberia?s legitimate aspirationsand constitutional obligation to its people. It should benoted that in spite of the support of the Liberian people fortheir Government  there may remain some disgruntledcitizens and external actors who seek to disturb the peaceand reverse the progress achieved thus far by capitalizingon the perceived inability of the Government to adequatelyprotect itself because of the present arms embargo on thecountry. For the Security Council to place a Member Stateof this Organization in such an untenable position isinimical to the interests of the Liberian Government andpeople and inconsistent with the purposes and principlesof the United Nations.The Government of Liberia calls on the SecurityCouncil to impartially assume its responsibility under theCharter by expeditiously redressing what is considered tobe an injustice to Liberia by lifting its 1992 armsembargo  imposed on the country for the reasons alreadymentioned.At the threshold of the twenty-first century  it mustbe recognized that the full achievement of the goals andobjectives of this Organization has been largelyundermined by the long period of the cold war. Its demiseheld out the promise of a peace dividend that was to beapplied to the development activities of the UnitedNations.Regrettably  that is not the case today. However within a renewed  principled spirit of interdependence  theinternational community can evolve an effective means ofpartnership and cooperation to achieve equity in the areasof economic development and social advancement asnecessary conditions for the maintenance of global peaceand security.By so doing  we will have crafted a workable agendathat will propel the human family into the newmillennium with the hope of a just world order that isresponsive to the needs of all inhabitants of our commonplanet  as envisaged in the Charter.Let me give the assurance that Liberia remainscommitted to this basic goal in the same determinedmanner as when it signed the Charter of the UnitedNations in 1945."
"96",4065,"LBY",53,1998,"Allow me at the outset to congratulateMr. Opertti on his accession to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at this session. His election is a tributeto his friendly country and an expression of confidence inhis ability to shoulder this great responsibility.I also take this opportunity to express our deepappreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his skilfulguidance of the deliberations of the previous session ofthe General Assembly. Furthermore  I would also like toexpress my country?s high appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his initiatives  which have helpedease tensions in a number of regions  and for his effortsin making a series of serious proposals for the reform ofthe United Nations and to reactivate its role  therebyallowing it to perform the functions entrusted to it by theCharter.The United Nations is the only Organization whichenjoys universal membership. That is why it is the soleforum qualified to deal with urgent international  political economic and social problems. To address these questionseffectively  it is essential  first and foremost  to observethe principles of the Charter of the United Nations  whichmust govern both the work of the Organization and theconduct of its Members. Our commitment to theprinciples of sovereign equality  non-interference in theinternal affairs of States and abstention from the threat oruse of force requires us to oppose the ambitions andpractices of certain countries that seek to impose theirhegemony and influence and to monopolize privileges.The mandated powers of the General Assembly  inparticular  should be expanded to allow it to play itsrightful role  which is based on equality among all itsmembers and on the fact that they all deliberate on anequal footing  including in their consideration of questionsof international peace and security. It would be helpful inthis respect to establish a mechanism to enable theAssembly to oversee the work of other organs  includingthe Security Council  and to hold them accountable to it.Any wealthy country in arrears that cares about theUnited Nations should pay those arrears immediately andunconditionally  because they are to blame for the17financial deterioration affecting the activities of theOrganization.The reform of the United Nations will remainincomplete without reforming the Security Council toeliminate the privilege of the veto power. Historically andin terms of justice  equality and democracy  there is nolonger any justification for that power. My country was thefirst to call for the abrogation of the veto power in thesecond half of this century. Moreover  it is essential toremove the current imbalance in the membership of theSecurity Council  not by granting certain countriespermanent membership  but through an increase in thenumber of its members  based on the principle of fullsovereign equality among States and the application of theprinciple of equitable geographical distribution in bothcategories of Council membership: permanent and non-permanent. The reform of the Council should  first andforemost  respond to the needs of the developing countries which constitute the majority of the United Nationsmembership  and to the need to avoid selectivity.Despite the efforts of African countries and theirOrganization  conflict is on the rise and economicconditions are further deteriorating on that continent.Whatever development or increase in income they achievegoes to servicing debts that weigh heavily on them all. Inhis report on the situation in Africa  the Secretary-Generalexplains that this situation is the result of the policiesadopted by the colonial Powers at the 1885 Congress ofBerlin to partition the continent. These policies remain theroot cause of conflict in Africa. The report further indicatesthat Africa?s problems  including political instability insome parts and economic underdevelopment in most of thecontinent  were caused by those who drew the politicalborders of African countries. We call for the cancellation ofAfrica?s debts and for the continent to be dealt with on newand fair bases  not just as a source of raw materials and amarket for the consumption of manufactured goods.The responsibility for all that has happened and is stilltaking place on the African continent falls to those whocaused it in the first place. Therefore  it is high time for theStates that colonized Africa  exploited its resources andenslaved its peoples to apologize to the continent and topay full compensation for all the losses it has incurred asa result of colonialism.The imposition of restrictions on international tradeand the legislation of extraterritorial laws require seriousaction on our part to confront and put an end to them.Member States are called upon to support and vote infavour of the relevant draft resolution to be submitted tothe General Assembly at this session and not to recognizesuch unilateral laws  which undermine the lofty principlesof the United Nations Charter  flagrantly violate the rulesof international law  encroach on the sovereignty ofMember States and blatantly interfere in their internalaffairs.The question of Palestine is still awaiting a solution.All developments  past and present  serve only to confirmwhat my country has repeatedly stated: Occupation byforce and the dictation and imposition of surrender cannever lead to peace. No support for the occupation andthe settlement policy or undermining of the balance ofpower will help to establish peace. The displacedPalestinians living outside their land are far morenumerous than those who live on Palestinian territory.What kind of peace is it that prevents a people fromreturning to their territory  their homeland?The continued occupation of the Syrian Golan since1967  the occupation of southern Lebanon  and the wayin which the Security Council has been prevented fromimplementing its resolution 425 (1978) are further proofof the weakening of the United Nations as a result of theintervention of the major Powers. In this respect  wewould ask: Why does the Security Council insist on theimplementation of some and not all of its resolutions? Solong as the United Nations remains paralysed by theblatant interference of the powerful  who exploit it onlyto serve their own interests and prevent it from actingwhen there is a question of deterring or repulsingaggression by their allies  this glaring injustice willcontinue to push the Middle East towards the abyss.The achievement of the universality of the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and theexpansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones are facing majorobstacles. In the Arab East  the rulers of Tel Aviv stillrefuse to adhere to the NPT. They refuse to place theirnuclear facilities under the control regime of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency. They continue todevelop their nuclear capabilities with the financial andtechnical support of the United States  the very countrythat  under the pretext of saving the world from chemicalweapons  threatens to attack any Arab country  includingmy own  merely for building a pharmaceutical plant. Therecent destruction of the Sudanese pharmaceutical factoryunder such flimsy pretexts  later proven false  is still freshin our minds.18Nobody should be deceived by the utterings of therulers of Tel Aviv to the effect that the Arabs and theirweapons are a source of danger. Neither Libya nor anyother Arab State constitutes a threat to the peace of theregion  let alone the whole world. These are countries thatneither produce nor export weapons. Washington hasdestroyed the weapons that Iraq once had and has imposedembargoes on other countries to prevent Iraq fromimporting arms. The real danger to security in the regionand the entire world comes from the Israelis  who possesshundreds of nuclear warheads. So long as nuclear weaponsand other weapons of mass destruction are not destroyed inall the countries that possess them  any lesser effort willrepresent a great attempt to deceive the whole world.Since the dawn of time  humanity has been afflictedby a phenomenon that has been exacerbated in moderntimes: national and international terrorism. The annals ofhistory record terrorist acts  their victims and theirperpetrators. If we peruse these records  much is revealed.They show that those self-styled fighters against terrorismwere the first to perpetrate terrorism. By posing as fightersof terrorism  they are trying to cover the terrorist crimesthey have committed and still commit against othercountries and peoples. Their history is no more than aseries of terrorist acts against other peoples  which havereached the stage of total annihilation of entire peoples.These self-styled fighters of terrorism have attemptedto brand movements of liberation and the struggle forfreedom and against occupation as terrorist. They stilldescribe all fighters for freedom and independence asterrorists. But they fail miserably when most fighters for thefreedom and independence of their countries eventuallytriumph. Suddenly  those who fought against these freedomfighters and backed those who enslaved them are ready toroll out the red carpet for them  organize the greatestreceptions and award them the highest medals. This GeneralAssembly embraces a number of such leaders every yearand  only a few days ago  gave the fighter and leaderNelson Mandela an outstanding reception.Libya is proud to have been among the countries thatsupported these leaders during their struggle. Libya takespride in their victories. Libya took that position at a timewhen those who now claim to fight terrorism used todescribe those leaders as terrorists. Libya knows that thechange in these countries? attitudes following the triumphof revolutionaries and freedom fighters neither reflectsprincipled morality  nor aims at atoning for past mistakes.It is due to a desire to preserve their interests and to gaingreater political and economic advantages.When we talk of terrorism  we should know oursubject. Our talk must be objective and we need to agreeon a single definition of terrorism. We should apply thesame criteria and the same rules and laws. We must alsoimplement the same measures and procedures. We cannotcondemn terrorism and fight it when it hits a certaincountry  then turn a blind eye when it hits other countriesor other peoples. The occupation of Lebanon  thesurrounding of its capital and the attack on Qana wereacts of terrorism. The aggression against Libya in 1986and earlier was terrorism. The invasion of Grenada wasterrorism. The kidnapping of a head of State is terrorism.Maintaining military bases on other peoples? territory isterrorism. Navies? threats and attacks against peoples andviolation of their territorial waters — this is terrorism.Attempts on the lives of national leaders are terrorism.The downing of a Libyan civilian airplane over Sinai wasterrorism. The downing of the Iranian airplane in the Gulfwas terrorism. Forcing the Security Council to react to amissile that fell in the sea and preventing it from reactingto missiles that were intentionally launched against apharmaceutical plant in a peaceful city  Khartoum  andfrom sending a mere fact-finding mission — this isterrorism. In this respect  we forcefully support Sudanesedemands for investigation and compensation and condemnthis terrorist aggression.Are we supposed to condemn terrorism only whenit touches a certain country or countries? Should we turna blind eye and a deaf ear to what is being committed bythat country or those countries against humanity as awhole? This  too  is terrorism. Terrorism will beeradicated only when its causes  not just its results  areaddressed; not by committing similar terrorist acts. Wecannot fight terrorism with terrorism. As one Arab poetsays:“Practise what you preach. Great shame on you ifyou do not.”We in Libya condemn terrorist acts  theirperpetrators  their sponsors and those who finance them.We are ready to cooperate with all countries that trulywant to put an end to terrorism. Libya  in a letter to theSecretary-General dated 9 January 1992 (documentA/46/840)  was the first to call on the United Nations toconvene a special session of the General Assembly to bedevoted to international terrorism.In this respect  we wish to note that some peopleinsist  in and out of context  on linking Islam andMuslims to terrorism. This in itself is another kind of19terrorism. The very name of Islam is derived from the wordsalaam  which means “peace”. A person is considered aMuslim when others are safe from his words and his deeds.The greeting of Muslims  when coming or going  isassalamu alaikum  meaning “peace be upon you”  and theanswer is “and the same to you”.It seems believable that  as has been demonstrated insome works and studies  certain people can determine theirown identity only by identifying their enemy. Now that theideological enemy  embodied for several decades in thecommunist ideology  has disappeared  they have chosenIslam as their new alternative adversary. Upon thedisappearance of the international opponent  the formerSoviet Union  they chose the Muslims to be the newenemy.At this juncture  let us ask the following questions though we know in advance that they will go unanswered.First  who recruited  transported  financed  trained andarmed those who fought in Afghanistan during the presenceof Soviet troops there? Secondly  who called these peoplemujahidin when they fought against the Soviets inAfghanistan? And who now calls them terrorists? How andwhy did yesterday?s mujahid become today?s terrorist?Thirdly  where do the leaders of the organizations whichplan and supervise the implementation of terrorist actionsin their homelands live? Sisterly Algeria is not the onlyexample. Fourthly  who protects these people? Whofinances them? Who arms them? Who trains them? Where?And Why?These and other  similar questions will not be publiclyacknowledged by the parties concerned  but that does notmean that there is no answer. Islam is the victim. Muslimsare the targets and victims of terrorism  alongside the restof third world peoples. God Almighty addresses his Prophetand Messenger in the Koran by saying:“We sent thee not  but as a mercy for all creatures.”(The Holy Koran  XXI:107)Verily spoke God. The Prophet of mercy preached thereligion of mercy  not terrorism.My country has always sought to make theMediterranean a region of security  cooperation and peace.It is a source of satisfaction that in July this year we issueda joint statement with Italy which eliminated many aspectsof the legacy of the past and laid down a solid basis forcooperation to serve the interests of both countries andpeoples and contribute to the strengthening of peace andstability in that strategic part of the world. We believethat this is a model that should be emulated in otherarrangements  including European and Mediterraneanpartnerships. Among the issues on which the peoples ofthe Mediterranean should cooperate and act in solidarityis the foreign military presence in the region. We inLibya would again like to express our concern about thispresence. We again call on foreign States to dismantletheir military bases around the Mediterranean andwithdraw their fleets from its waters. Their presenceposes a danger to the peoples of the region.The world is still witnessing a continuation of olddisputes and conflicts such as those in Cyprus Afghanistan  Angola and Somalia. These conflicts havepersisted for too long  despite all the efforts made toresolve them peacefully. The international communityshould increase its efforts to settle these disputes and endthe suffering of their peoples.The people of Iraq are suffering from internationalsanctions which are unprecedented in their severity andcruelty. These sanctions have resulted in human tragedieswhich could never be accepted by principled humanbeings. Other countries have exploited these sanctions inorder to achieve their own selfish political purpose ofdestroying Iraq  violating its territorial integrity andbreaking up its unity. This will have disastrousconsequences sooner or later. Furthermore  it is aviolation of the Charter  the principles of international lawand all international norms.In the Horn of Africa the situation in Somalia is stilla source of great concern. My country has consistentlymade efforts to assist the competing Somali factions solvetheir differences. We will continue those efforts with aview to reaching a solution to ensure Somali nationalreconciliation that is satisfactory to all Somalis. TheJamahiriya  which has the honour of presiding over thegroup of Sahel and desert countries  has submitted aserious initiative for the settlement of the dispute betweenEthiopia and Eritrea. This initiative  which enjoys fullrecognition  remains the best framework for the solutionof the border dispute between the two countries and thenormalization of relations between their two peoples.I should now like to provide an account of the latestdevelopments in the dispute between my country and theUnited States and the United Kingdom over the Lockerbiequestion. In this regard  I shall deal with the latest  notthe oldest  of these developments. On 21 July the mediaannounced that the United States and the United Kingdom20were considering the possibility of accepting the twosuspects for trial in a third country  which may be theNetherlands.Libya contacted the President of the Security Counciland most of its members  as well as the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  to welcome this development in the eventthat it became an official position. To prove and confirm itsseriousness  Libya suggested to them that the Secretary-General should look into the matter once it became anofficial position and contact all the parties to seek to reacha practical and serious formula that would respond to theinterests of all the parties and could gain their approval.Our intention was that if such a formula were submitted tothe Security Council  its approval would be assured and itsimplementation would thereby be a foregone conclusion.At the time  Libya expressed a number of fears andconcerns to which it drew attention and warned against theSecurity Council approving any formula that did notaddress such fears and concerns in its enthusiasm of feelingthat there was a positive development on the issue.At that time — the last week of July — we drewattention to the fact that Libya was concerned that the otherparty might have taken its approach for certain short-termreasons: first  to circumvent the two Judgments of theInternational Court of Justice; secondly  to pre-empt thedecision taken at the Ouagadougou summit; thirdly  toforestall a potential resolution at the Durban summit;fourthly  to continue the sanctions imposed on Libya;fifthly  to distance between the international community andsupport for Libya by misleading it into believing that theother party had already accepted the proposals of regionaland international organizations; and sixthly  to take thewhole question back to its starting point.At that time  before the official position of the twocountries was made public and as a test of the seriousnessof the other party  Libya stressed the need for certainconsiderations. First  we requested a guarantee that the twosuspects would not be handed over or moved to either theUnited States or the United Kingdom. Secondly  we askedfor a guarantee of their legal  religious  social  personal andhealth rights throughout the various phases of the trial.Thirdly  we requested that the Libyan judicial authoritiesand the defence of the two suspects should handle alltechnical  legal questions relevant to the legal aspect of thetrial. We were now talking about a legal and not a politicalmatter. The legal and judicial authorities of the countriesconcerned had done so with regard to their side of thequestion.Our intuition proved right and our suspicions wereconfirmed. On Monday  24 August 1998  the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom addressed a joint letter tothe Secretary-General to which they attached the text ofa draft agreement between the Government of theKingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of theUnited Kingdom  together with the text of a bill whichthe United Kingdom intended to enact as law to enablethe Scottish Court to conduct the trial in the Netherlands.On Tuesday  25 August  the two countries submitteda draft resolution to the Security Council. On Wednesday 26 August  the draft resolution was formally submitted tothe Council. On Thursday  27 August  as we expected  theSecurity Council approved the draft resolution  motivatedby a feeling that it was a positive development  withoutpausing to discover the poison that was slippedsurreptitiously into the honey.The letter sent to the Secretary-General  togetherwith its detailed and complicated legal attachments  wasapproved without giving even the members of theSecurity Council a chance to study them. Libya thenrequested the Council to postpone acting on the resolutionbecause it and its attachments required consideration bythe competent Libyan judicial authorities. Thesedocuments had not at that time reached Libya and had noteven been translated into Arabic.The adversary and the arbiter in the Councilprevented the Council from responding to Libya?s request.During the review session last March  the same adversaryand the same arbiter prevented the Council from studyingthe Judgments of the International Court of Justice officially referred to it by Libya  under the pretext thatthese Judgments needed to be studied by legal experts intheir two countries. This stark contradiction in positionsand criteria we leave to the judgement of the Assembly and we have no doubt that it will reach the rightconclusions.Security Council resolution 1192 (1998)  adopted on27 August 1998  suggests that the Libyan ArabJamahiriya has not implemented the requirements ofCouncil resolutions  as in paragraph 1 it“Demands once again that the LibyanGovernment immediately comply with the above-mentioned resolutions.”This refers to resolutions 731 (1992)  748 (1992)  883(1993). It also suggests that Libya has done nothing in21that connection  whereas Libya has responded fully to all ofthese resolutions.Paragraph 4 of resolution 1192 (1998) states that“the Libyan Government shall ensure that anyevidence or witnesses in Libya are  upon the requestof the court  promptly made available at the court inthe Netherlands for the purpose of the trial”.To ask Libya to provide evidence and witnessescontradicts logic and law. It is not Libya that has accusedthe two suspects. It is the United States and the UnitedKingdom that claim to possess evidence which justifiestheir suspicions. They alone have the responsibility toprovide the evidence and the witnesses for the prosecutionin order to prove their case. This demand in itself provesthat those two countries have no evidence to support theaccusation of our two citizens. On what  then  is thissuspicion based? It is a suspicion still in search of evidenceand witnesses. The best quotation we can cite in thisrespect is the statement made by the freedom fighter andleader  President Nelson Mandela  last week in Washington:“I know of no system of jurisprudence anywhere in theworld where the accused is required to produce witnessesfor the prosecution.”On the whole  in the text to which I have beenreferring  Libya sees interference in the work andprocedures of the court  a limitation on the rights of theaccused to defend themselves  and an abrogation of Libya?slegal rights guaranteed under international law and customgoverning procedures and the provision of proof.Security Council resolution 1192 (1998) referred to thejoint letter dated 24 August 1998 from the Governments ofthe United Kingdom and of the United States  contained indocument S/1998/795  to which is annexed the text of theintended agreement between the Governments of theKingdom of the Netherlands and of the United Kingdom.In its article 16 (2)  that agreement refers to the“transfer [of] the accused from the premises of theScottish Court [in the Netherlands] to the territory ofthe United Kingdom ... “(a) ... for the purpose of trial by jury inScotland”. (S/1998/795  annex II)However  the initiative adopted by the Security Council which in essence is a political initiative  is based on whatwas adopted by the regional and international organizationswhose letters were cited in the preambular part ofSecurity Council resolution 1192 (1998). Here we wouldlike to refer in particular to the content of the joint letterfrom the Secretaries-General of the League of Arab Statesand of the Organization of African Unity  annexed todocument S/1997/497. Any text that would make itpossible to transfer the two suspects to any place otherthan the Netherlands  under any circumstances  runscounter to the regional initiatives accepted by the LibyanArab Jamahiriya. That is only some of the poison in thehoney: the world has heard that the United Kingdom andthe United States have agreed to have a trial in theNetherlands. Now they talk about Scotland  the UnitedKingdom and the United States. We shall clarify thispresently.The letter then states  in paragraph 4  that  “If foundguilty  the two accused will serve their sentence in theUnited Kingdom”. Moreover  the intended agreementstates in article 16 (2) (b) that the accused would betransferred to the United Kingdom “for the purpose ofserving a custodial sentence imposed by the ScottishCourt following the conviction of the accused”.That contradicts the initiative; I cannot believe thatanyone understood the initiative to mean anything otherthan that the trial would take place in a third country.This provision runs counter to the general understandingof the initiative  that the purpose of the trial of the twosuspects is to reveal the truth in the tragic incident of PanAm flight 103  and not to exact revenge on two Libyancitizens who are merely suspected  without evidence. It isthe understanding also that the ultimate venue of all thetrial procedures would be in a third country: in theNetherlands  and not anywhere else. The agreement bythe various parties to the holding of the trial in theNetherlands is a political solution that came about as aresult of political action. The place where the sentenceshould be served  if  God forbid  they are convicted should be the same place as the trial. This is part of thepolitical solution.They claim that Scottish law stipulates that sentencesshould be served in Scotland  because Scottish courts sitin Scotland. But this court will sit outside Scotland  soany sentence should also be carried out outside Scotland.The court is  exceptionally  sitting in another country  sothe sentence must be served in the country where the trialtakes place  not in Scotland.Paragraph 8 of Security Council resolution 1192(1998) reads in part that the Council22“decides that the aforementioned measures shall besuspended immediately if the Secretary-Generalreports to the Council that the two accused havearrived in the Netherlands for the purpose of trialbefore the court described in paragraph 2 or” — andhere pay attention to this new poison in the honey —“have appeared for trial before an appropriate court inthe United Kingdom or the United States”.In a dispute that has lasted for more than seven years  thisis the first time that the Security Council has adopted aresolution asserting that the trial can take place before acourt in the United Kingdom or the United States. I haveaddressed a letter to the Secretary-General indicating thatthe proposal of the League of Arab States and theOrganization of African Unity regarding a trial underScottish law  before a Scottish court  at the InternationalCourt of Justice in The Hague defines an “appropriatecourt”. But the resolution says(spoke in English)“an appropriate court in the United Kingdom or the UnitedStates”  not an appropriate British or United States court.(spoke in Arabic)For the first time  the resolution refers to such a venue.There is no need for the addition of a reference to an“appropriate court in the United Kingdom or the UnitedStates” — unless the purpose is to transfer the two suspectsto the Netherlands as a transit station before transferringthem to one of the two countries mentioned in thatparagraph. If that is the case  it can be qualified only asinstitutional piracy condoned by Security Councilresolution. The world is unaware of this situation. I knowthat members are busy with their own concerns  but Iremind them that I am citing the text of the new SecurityCouncil resolution.Along with the rest of the international community  wehave agreed to a trial before a Scottish court sitting in athird country  which could be the Netherlands. We haveagreed to a Scottish court  to Scottish law and to Scottishjudges  in the Netherlands. Those are the terms describedin the decisions of the regional organizations. But whatdoes that paragraph mean?But Libya never subscribed to these new terms  andthe regional organizations never agreed that a trial shouldtake place in the United States or in the United Kingdom.To suggest that this is the “appropriate court” referred to inparagraph 16 of resolution 883 (1993) is to attempt todeceive the international community  and is yet anotherexample of the poison in the honey. The Council wasmisled into accepting this because of the existence of afeeling that there was a change in the position of the twocountries.Another meaningless reference came in paragraph 8on the relations between the Libyan Government and theFrench judicial authorities  relevant to the explosion ofUnion de Transports Aériens flight 772. This question hasnothing to do with the subject of the initiative upon whichresolution 1192 (1998) is based. Moreover  it is wellestablished in the Security Council that Libya has done allthat has been required of it by the French judge in thisrespect and that the French authorities have expressedtheir total satisfaction  and this was endorsed by theSecurity Council.Libya believes that the optimal  pragmatic andprompt solution lies in conducting negotiations among allparties with a view to reaching an agreement on thepractical procedures for the application of the option oftrying the two suspects before a Scottish court in a neutralcountry — the Netherlands — as called for by the summitof the Non-Aligned Movement held in South Africa at thebeginning of September 1998.Should direct negotiations prove impossible due tothe opposition of the United States and the UnitedKingdom  these negotiations can be conducted through theSecretary-General. The proposed agreement shoulddetermine all practical measures  the commitments ofeach party and the rights and guarantees to be accordedthe two suspects and their defence team. It should alsoprecisely state what all the parties are required to do sothat the trial of the two suspects will be the final phase ofthe implementation of Security Council resolutions  notthe first phase. This should lead to the lifting of thesanctions imposed on Libya and put an end to anyattempts to change positions or otherwise circumvent thesituation under the pretext that Libya has not fullycomplied with Security Council resolutions — becauseLibya has fully done what it has been required to do.Even the exchange of goods is governed byagreements and contracts that regulate and explain theresponsibilities of various parties  suppliers and exporters.Goods are insured and reinsured against all risks. Theseare people  human beings we are talking about here. Theyare not going to the Netherlands for tourism; we?re notgoing to bid them farewell  have a nice trip. Having said23that  we wonder what is meant by electing to hold the trialin a military base used by the Americans in theNetherlands? Is the base that the Americans use asmembers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the onlyplace in the Netherlands where the trial can take place?What is this?Following are some of the questions that the LibyanArab Jamahiriya deems it necessary to resolve and reach anagreement on. First  there is a need to agree on listing clarifying and determining  in advance  the witnessesneeded — not only from Libya  but from all parties. Thedefence team should have the right to receive and peruse allevidence and cross-examine all witnesses. Secondly  thereneeds to be agreement on the place where the suspectswould spend the time of their sentence in case ofconviction  either in the Netherlands or in Libya. Thirdly we need guarantees that the two suspects will not beextradited or transferred to either the United States or theUnited Kingdom for any reason whatsoever at any phase ofthe trial. Fourthly  there needs to be an agreement on thesecurity  legal  personal  social  health and religious rightsof the two suspects during the various phases of the trial.We need to conclude an agreement between theKingdom of the Netherlands and the Libyan ArabJamahiriya specifying how the two suspects will betransferred to the Netherlands and guaranteeing theirsecurity and safety  during their transfer  stay and theirreturn at the end of the trial. Such an agreement should beendorsed by the Security Council and implemented underthe supervision of the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations.In conclusion  I would like to reaffirm that the LibyanArab Jamahiriya has accepted a trial of the two suspectsbefore a Scottish court in accordance with Scottish law presided over by Scottish judges  that would sit in theNetherlands  but we will not accept the setting of anyconditions in relation to the implementation of thatproposal. Libya is ready to take this exceptional road inorder to reach a solution to the dispute that would satisfythe interests of all parties and in order to settle theoutstanding legal issues through direct negotiations orthrough the Secretary-General.Libya has not interfered in the agreements concludedby the other parties for the purposes of the trial. Also  ithas not authorized anyone to decide on her behalf mattersrelating to her citizens  because this is its constitutionalright and duty. The United Kingdom and the Netherlandscan conclude an agreement; this has to do with theNetherlands court and because the Netherlands is the seatof the court  but as far as the Libyan citizens areconcerned  we never authorized anyone to conclude anyagreements on our behalf. We are responsible for ourcitizens  the suspects included. They have a team oflawyers to defend them. We do not interfere in otherStates? affairs  nor do we want anyone to interfere withour affairs either.We would like to confirm our seriousness  our desireand our willingness to close the file of this case and otherfiles as well  and open a new chapter in our relations withthe countries concerned based on mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs."
"97",4096,"LCA",53,1998,"Mr. President  it is sucha pleasure that a distinguished son of our region shouldpreside over these proceedings. We wish you well andpledge our full support.This year we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of thebirth of a Declaration which was predicated on theassumption that the right to development is a human right.The golden jubilee of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights could not have occurred at a more timely juncturein the history of international affairs. Article 23 of theDeclaration insists that everyone has the right to work  thefree choice of employment and protection againstunemployment. Article 28 boasts that everyone is entitledto a social and international order in which the rights andfreedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fullyrealized.However  the trends that shape the internationalorder today  the issues that are affecting the destiny ofStates  are running counter to the spirit of thatDeclaration  and are  in fact  threatening and hinderingthat right to development so nobly expressed 50 yearsago.As the world enters the dawn of a new millennium the phenomenon of globalization characterizes the newinternational order. There is no escaping the reality thatglobalization is today a fact of life: the integration andinterlocking of systems of production  finance and capitaland trade  and liberalized markets that have shunnednational boundaries and have produced remarkable wealthand economic growth.22But there is an almost ominous ring about the word“globalization”. It gobbles up the small plankton ofcountries which cannot adjust to the frenzy of the market.Globalization has not been all about wealth and prosperityfor all the nations of the world. For billions of people in thedeveloping world  it has used them and bypassed them when in reality  globalization should be about developmentfor all.The 1997 United Nations Development Programmereport confirms that only a few fortunate countries hadbenefited from globalization. Those countries which haveshared in the rapidly expanded world trade have seen theirown trade become a larger proportion of their grossdomestic product. But for 44 developing countries  withmore than a billion people  this key ratio had been fallingover the previous decade. Yes  the growth in financialflows has been rapid  but its circulation has beenpredominantly in the capital markets of the developedworld  while investment flows have coursed through onlya few developing countries.The Asian Tiger economies  which had achievedamazing levels of development and growth in a short spaceof time  had been held up as models for the new age ofglobal free markets. However  the collapse of theseeconomies in 1997  coming three years after the Mexicancase  has reinforced fears that globalization has made theworld economy more volatile and more unstable. That evensuch star performers would be battered so severely suggeststhat vulnerability has increased significantly withglobalization. Foreign money can flee as quickly as itcomes in and leave countries in deep trouble.Saint Lucia is one of those countries caught up on thedizzy Ferris wheel of globalization  without the luxury ofthe choice of being able to jump off or determine how thewheel spins. Trade liberalization  the twin of globalization has not been kind to us  and the midwife of tradeliberalization — the World Trade Organization (WTO) —has dealt us an even more unkind cut.Last year  the head of our Government  Prime MinisterDr. Kenny Anthony  in his address to the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-second session  complained of theimpact on Saint Lucia and the Caribbean of a ruling by theWTO with respect to the European banana marketingregime. That ruling  which was instigated by a fewcomplainant countries from the Americas  has the capacityto lead to the social and economic destruction of a numberof small States in the Caribbean  like Saint Lucia  for whichbananas are a major vital export commodity. That rulingtears at the heart of our development process  as it cantake away from us a system which allows us apreferential market for a crop which is the backbone ofour economy.Developing countries and many renowned juristshave criticized the process pursued by the WTO in thiscase  but what was equally worrying is that the panel didnot take into account the developmental  social andenvironmental impact of the implementation of this ruling.The WTO is not only to be a trade policeman  but issupposed to contribute to improving standards of living.Following the ruling by the WTO last year  that thebanana marketing regime was incompatible with itsregulations  the European Union had been trying to amendthe regime. The objective was not only to make it WTO-compatible  but at the same time  to preserve the kind ofaccess it gave us to the European market — an accessessential for our economic development. Earlier this yearthe European Union accepted amendments to the bananaregime which we are all convinced make it WTO-compatible. We  the banana-producing countries of theCaribbean  may have wished that some of the provisionsnow adopted were different  but we are satisfied that thenew regime allows us the opportunity to continue tosurvive in the market place and sustain our developmentlargely through our own efforts.The European Union retained the special safeguardsof Lomé to enable us to market our bananas; and with theLomé Convention now in receipt of a WTO waiver  wethought that we had been given the breathing space weneeded for orderly reform and diversification and foradjustment to the new realities of globalization. But despite this  the United States and a group of CentralAmerican countries are continuing an onslaught againstour banana industry.One year after our Prime Minister appealed to thisbody for good sense and sensitivity to prevail in thesettling of world trade disputes  in the consideration byinternational institutions of the plight of thedisadvantaged  and in the conduct of strong and powerfulcountries towards smaller and poorer ones  we return totell the Assembly that those who should have heeded thisappeal seem to have chosen not to hear it.The pursuit of this banana policy by the UnitedStates and the Central American countries will expose theeconomies of the Caribbean to severe and possiblyirreparable damage. This is a violation of our right to23development — a right that the United Nations recognizedas an inalienable human right when it adopted theDeclaration on the Right to Development at the 97thplenary meeting of the forty-first session of the GeneralAssembly on 4 December 1986. One year ago  our PrimeMinister  before this Assembly  called upon the UnitedStates of America to re-examine its policies towards theCaribbean  particularly its lead role in the challenge to thebanana marketing regime. We are now engaged in adialogue with the United States hoping to avert areconvening of the World Trade Organization dispute panel.Once again we urge the United States and the othercomplainant countries to apply the spirit of cooperation andconsultation to this situation so that we can find a mutuallyacceptable solution to what they perceive to be theproblems.Globalization must not be used by powerful States asan excuse to condemn us to a permanent state ofunderdevelopment and poverty. Already the rich nations ofthe world appear to be using globalization as an excuse fortheir withdrawal from active engagement in the battleagainst poverty.The scourge of poverty is not new  neither has it everbeen acceptable. What is unacceptable is that given all thestrides we have made this century in science andtechnology  in the creation of vast oceans of wealth  we atthe same time have failed to reduce the levels of povertyaround the world.Many people have enjoyed the benefits of supersonicaircraft  200-mile-per-hour trains  satellite telephones  globaltelevision  the Internet and 24-hour markets. Yet  in thesame world and at the same time  there are millions whohave never ridden in a motor vehicle  used a telephone switched on an electric light or had pipe-borne water;millions wholly unfamiliar with such everyday amenities asrefrigerators and television sets; millions who cannot reador write; millions of children who do not go to school;millions of infants who do not get enough food to survive.A more vigorous effort to eliminate extremedeprivation should surely be a high priority for the newmillennium. Saint Lucia believes this should be achieved bythe end of the United Nations Decade for the Eradication ofPoverty — by the year 2006.Economic progress in recent decades has lifted largenumbers out of acute poverty  and success on this front hasbeen particularly notable in the populous country of China.But there is no evidence yet that globally there has been adecline in the number of those classified as “absolutepoor”: people whose incomes never rise above the dollar-a-day threshold. These are reckoned to amount to 1.3billion people  or one in every three persons in thedeveloping world. Nearly three fourths of these peoplelive in Asia  but the highest proportion of very poorpeople is in Africa. The 1997 report of the UnitedNations Development Programme states that the totalfigure appears to be rising with population growth  exceptin South-East Asia and the Pacific. But this was writtenbefore the economic typhoon that battered such South-East Asian countries as Indonesia in 1998  impoverishingmany millions of people in that region  and before theserious floods in China had dispossessed so many people.Yet most countries have failed to lift their aidtowards the level of 0.7 per cent of their gross nationalproduct — the internationally agreed target set severaldecades ago. In fact  aid from the G-7 countries fell in1997 to just 0.19 per cent of their collective grossnational product.The necessity for the rich countries to understandthat the new international order of globalization does notconsider the special circumstances of small States isemphasized by the vulnerability of these small States toother elements  such as natural disasters. The extremevulnerability of small island States  like Saint Lucia  wasgraphically illustrated only last week in the Caribbean. Injust a few hours Hurricane Georges created havoc anddestruction in the northern islands of the Caribbean —Saint Kitts and Nevis  Antigua and Barbuda  the VirginIslands  Puerto Rico  Haiti  the Dominican Republic andothers. In any one island  at least two decades ofeconomic development were blown away by two hours ofstorm. That is the extent of the economic vulnerability ofthese islands. As they struggle to rebuild their economies as their people try to reorganize their lives again  weappeal to the Member States of the United Nations to begenerous in coming forward with assistance for theirredevelopment efforts.In a world of an international order that isuncompromising for small States  of inadequate attentionto the plight of the poor and to the harsh destructiveforces of Mother Nature  it is the United Nations thatmust become a beacon and a haven for the small and thepowerless  for the hungry and the disadvantaged. It is inthe United Nations that they must find hope and comfort answers and solutions to their problems. For this however  there must be a United Nations that is assensitive to the danger inherent in small-State24vulnerability as it is to the horrors of nuclear warfare biological and chemical weapons and internationalterrorism. International terrorism can take many forms. Todestroy a country’s economic base and thrust its people intothe slow death of unemployment  poverty and despair is ashorrendous as the instant killing of its citizens by a bombblast.While we support the call for a strong abhorrence ofinternational terrorism  we must deplore equally abhorrentacts of unilateral counter-terrorism. Such actions violate theculture of peace and consensus which the United Nationsstrives to inculcate.There must be a United Nations with a greatercommitment to upholding and fulfilling the tenets of article28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and theUnited Nations Declaration on the Right to Development.There must therefore be further reform of the UnitedNations to make it more democratic and more appreciativeof the voices of the majority  rather than the power of theminority. Saint Lucia therefore supports the call by theSecretary-General for continued urgent reform of the UnitedNations  provided that it leads to a fairer  more caring andmore equitable institution.Saint Lucia also strongly supports the statementdelivered by Indonesia on behalf of the G-77 at the high-level dialogue on globalization held here recently and thegrowing consensus that there is urgent need for globalgovernance of financial and trade matters. Indeed  becauseof its universal membership and success in promotinginternational cooperation for development  the UnitedNations is the best vehicle to foster agreement on standards norms and regulations for the new financial order of thetwenty-first century.The building of a new international financialarchitecture for the twenty-first century cannot be donepiecemeal or by a few exclusive States. It requires globalparticipation  coordinated by the United Nations. SaintLucia therefore calls for a global conference to address thisissue similar to that held on matters pertaining to theenvironment  population and housing.But reform must not be confined only to the UnitedNations. In a world of trade liberalization which is notfriendly to small States  the guardian of the free marketprocess must itself be reformed. Saint Lucia thereforereiterates its call  first made to the fifty-second session ofthe General Assembly last year  for reform of the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) and in particular its dispute-settlement procedures. A revisiting of the WTO began inSingapore  where developing countries had to assert thelimits of WTO interventionism.What is additionally required of the WTO now wasoutlined by Prime Minister Mr. Kenny Anthony when  inhis capacity as Chairman of the Caribbean Community(CARICOM)  he addressed the recent meeting of heads ofState of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban  SouthAfrica. He said:“More generally  the WTO must now take urgentsteps to implement the agreement at Singapore  fora special regime for the least developed countriesand those who share the characteristics of fragility.It is time that values like fairness and equity assertedtheir legitimacy in the ethically neutral world ofglobalization and liberalization.”Saint Lucia firmly believes that despite the actionsof developed countries  we in the developing world canourselves assert and protect our right to development ifwe engage in greater cooperation among ourselves. We inthe Caribbean have for years been engaged in anintegration movement which has strengthened ourcapacity to deal with the challenges of internationalrelations. Indeed  this year Saint Lucia was proud to bethe host nation for the celebration of the twenty-fifthanniversary of the Treaty of Chaguaramas  which createdthe Caribbean Community.As we embark on the next quarter of a century Saint Lucia pledges to work for even greater union in theCaribbean Community and closer association between allthe countries of the Caribbean Sea. It is for this reasonthat Saint Lucia welcomes the recent initiatives that havebrought Cuba  the Dominican Republic and Haiti into acloser relationship with CARICOM as we seek to forgea new partnership with the European Union. In thisconnection  Saint Lucia calls for the understanding thatCuba is a Caribbean country and that closer relations withother Caribbean countries is a natural evolution whichmust not be perceived as being hostile to the interests ofextraregional Powers. We call too for the lifting of theeconomic embargo against Cuba and for its reintegrationinto the inter-American system. It is only throughdialogue and consultation  not through conflict andhostility  that problems are permanently solved.Saint Lucia also welcomes the recent meeting inDurban between the Caribbean Community and theSouthern African Development Community  which laidthe basis for the future strengthening of relations between25the two regions. We applaud also the decision by the headsof State of the Non-Aligned Movement to hold a South-South summit and their decision to convene a standingministerial committee for economic cooperation in 1999  toaddress the challenges and opportunities of globalization.Our efforts to realize our right to development canenjoy fulfilment only if they take place in an atmosphere ofworld peace and harmony. We cannot prevent nucleargenies from popping out of bottles unless we destroy all thebottles with a treaty designed to eliminate all nucleararmaments. The existence of exclusive nuclear clubs is anopen invitation to nations which are excluded.We in the Caribbean continue to call for the Caribbeanto be recognized as a zone of peace. We also call forrespect and support of the initiative of CARICOM for theCaribbean Sea to be declared a special area in the contextof sustainable development. Saint Lucia  therefore  likeother Caribbean States  continues to register its oppositionto the use of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-shipment ofnuclear waste by some great Powers. Whilesome of those Powers can sustain a nuclear accident given their size and population  a small island of a fewhundred thousand people certainly cannot. The bestguarantee we can obtain against a nuclear accident in theCaribbean Sea as a result of the trans-shipment of nuclearwaste is not the assurances of the countries engaged inthe practice  but a halt to the practice itself.As we call for international recognition of our rightto determine what kind of place we wish our region to be and as we assert our inalienable human right todevelopment and call upon others to respect that right bywithdrawing their challenge to the lifeblood of oureconomy  we urge the rich nations to recognize theinsensitivity of globalization  and we ask the internationalcommunity to take as an example that great internationalleader  President Nelson Mandela. As we seek to establisha new  more humane international order for the comingmillennium  an order that will truly reflect the spirit ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights  let usremember the moral leadership that he has given us.Nelson Mandela taught us that holding steadfast toprinciple and insisting on justice can produce change evenin the most intransigent of systems.The world has become a global neighbourhood  andwe must insist on living by brotherly principles andvalues. The focus for moral leadership might have shiftedto the developing world  with Nelson Mandela and FidelCastro as the twin peaks of international inspiration. It istheir lifelong struggle for human rights that must becomethe touchstone for our developmental goals in thisanniversary year."
"98",4123,"LIE",53,1998,"I wish to welcome at theoutset the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. He has assumed a difficult and importanttask  and we have full confidence in his ability to givethis body the direction required at a time when manycomplex issues are on its agenda.I would like to pay tribute to Secretary-General KofiAnnan  who has continued to represent our Organizationin an outstanding manner and to whom we are allindebted for initiating a comprehensive reform process.His presentation of the report on the work of theOrganization at the beginning of the general debate hasprovided us with a clear picture of where the UnitedNations stands today and of the major issues we mustaddress.We remain committed to the reform process andhope that the ongoing changes will bring about theurgently needed improvement in the financial situation ofthe Organization. We share the Secretary-General?s deepconcern at the deterioration of the security situation ofUnited Nations personnel involved in field operations andthe view that determined action by the General Assemblyis needed to address this problem  which poses a threat tomany core activities of the United Nations. On thepositive side  we share the satisfaction felt at the entryinto force of the Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-personnel Mines next spring and are pleased to announcethat Liechtenstein will deposit its own instrument ofratification very soon.After a series of major conferences in the first halfof this decade  we now have to tackle the important taskof addressing the follow-up processes to these majorevents  in order to ensure that the relevant finaldocuments are implemented on the national andinternational levels and thus translated into concreteaction for the benefit of people worldwide.This year  we celebrate both the adoption of theVienna Declaration and Programme of Action five yearsago and the adoption of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights in 1948  which is usually referred to as the32“50 plus 5” anniversary. We hope this event will send apowerful message to the world that the United Nations andits Member States are aware of the need for genuine andeffective national policies and international cooperation inorder to achieve the standards established in this area bythe United Nations.The Universal Declaration constitutes a milestone inthe history of human rights activities of the United Nationsand the basis for the remarkable achievements made overthe following years and decades. Therefore  it is our viewthat on 10 December we should reaffirm in strong and clearterms the contents of this Declaration  as well as ourcommitment to fully implement its provisions  in order toensure that all individuals worldwide benefit from thestandards set out in the Declaration.The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Actionhave been a key element in the human rights deliberationsfor half a decade now. The value and importance of thisdocument have become very clear during this period oftime  while the implementation of many of its contents hasbeen slow and not satisfactory. The Vienna document iscomplementary to the previously existing instruments andstandards in the field of human rights.Our main task is to ensure that these high-qualitystandards under international law are made a reality in dailylife for people worldwide  since there continues to be avery noticeable deep gap between these standards and theirimplementation in practice. I am pleased to announce thatthe Liechtenstein parliament has approved accession to theInternational Covenants on Human Rights  as well as to theprotocols to the second Covenant.We fully subscribe to the principle that all humanrights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and havethus to be treated on the same footing. There is  however one area to which we would like to give particularemphasis  namely  the promotion and protection of therights of children  which warrant our special attention. Thescope and number of violations of the rights of the childare particularly disturbing  and we are grateful to note thatthe international community has in the recent past steppedup its efforts to combat some of the most outrageous formsof such violations. Another welcome and necessary measureis the appointment of a Special Representative of theSecretary-General on children in armed conflicts. Wepledge our full support to the activities undertaken byMr. Olara Otunnu and express our hope that his office willbe provided with the necessary human and financialresources to fulfil its far-reaching and complex tasks. Weare disappointed that it has not yet been possible to adoptan optional protocol on children in armed conflicts  whichcould make a major contribution in this respect.A very important and timely impetus to the cause ofhuman rights and international humanitarian law wasprovided by the adoption of the Statute of an InternationalCriminal Court this summer in Rome. While theInternational Criminal Court is not a human rights court we consider the Rome Statute to be a very importantcontribution to Human Rights Year. We welcome theoutcome of the Rome Conference as an achievement oftruly historic dimensions and — like the Ottawaprocess — as an example of the fruitful role civil societycan play in an intergovernmental negotiating process ofhigh complexity. While we would have preferred to givethe International Criminal Court more far-reachingcompetence  we are very satisfied and encouraged to notethat what seemed like a dream just a few years ago nowhas a chance to become a reality. It is of crucialimportance to realize that the adoption of the statute wasnot the end of the process  but  rather  a decisive stepwhich requires determined follow-up and further hardwork from all of us. Constructive and serious work in thePreparatory Commission and a speedy process ofsignature and ratification are the most important tasks forthe imminent future  and we hope that the GeneralAssembly will send out a strong message to this end. Asa participant in the Rome Conference and as one of thefirst signatories of the Statute  Liechtenstein stands readyto make its contribution.One of the most disturbing developments in the pastyear took place in the field of nuclear non-proliferation.Liechtenstein continues to condemn all nuclear tests andhas expressed its concern at the impact of the testsconducted this year on political stability in the regionconcerned. This matter touches on the very existence ofhumankind  and thus we have to make every effort tocreate a non-proliferation regime which is just  effectiveand credible. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) of 1968 and the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996 constitute  if fullyimplemented  two cornerstones of such a regime. Othermeasures will be necessary  and it is of crucialsignificance that all countries stand ready to make theircontribution to solving this issue in the interest of all ofus.Our own region has been affected by the crisis in theformer Yugoslavia for many years now. We all welcomedthe conclusion of the Dayton Agreements  because they33brought an end to the terrible suffering of the people in theformer Yugoslavia. We remain concerned  however  at theslow process of implementation  especially with regard tothe civilian aspects of the Agreements.The year 1998 has brought about a new crisis ofalarming dimensions: the conflict in Kosovo. Liechtensteincondemns the numerous and serious violations ofinternational humanitarian law in this conflict and remainsvery concerned about the situation of the civilian populationand the potential impact of the developments in Kosovo onregional stability. Preventing a further deterioration of thehumanitarian situation and finding a viable political solutionare the two most important issues for a solution to theKosovo crisis  which poses a clear threat to internationalpeace and security and should therefore be dealt withappropriately by the United Nations. It has become clearonce again that the capacity of our Organization to dealwith such challenges needs to be enhanced and improved.As with other crises in the recent past  most notably the onein Rwanda  the outbreak of violence in Kosovo came as asurprise to nobody  and yet not enough was done to preventit.Further developing the concept of prevention andtranslating it into concrete action remains  therefore  in ourview  one of the most important issues on the agenda of theUnited Nations  and the increased involvement of womenin preventive diplomacy continues to be of particularimportance to us. We note with gratitude the signs of anincreased political will to support the concept of prevention while we believe that more concerted and determinedefforts to this end have to be made. We are ready to makeour contribution  and I would like to recall in this contextonce again our initiative on the right of self-determination.We are more convinced than ever that a more innovativeand flexible application and implementation of this right hasgreat potential to defuse tensions and prevent conflictswithin States — the type of conflicts with which theinternational community is most commonly faced thesedays. A genuine political dialogue between centralGovernments and communities living within States lies atthe heart of our ideas  the ultimate goal of which is theprevention of tendencies by such communities to claimstatehood and attempt to achieve this goal through violentmeans. The Liechtenstein Research Programme on Self-determination  conducted at Princeton University  hascontinued and increased its activities over the past year  andwe have noted with great satisfaction and gratitude theinterest and contributions from a large number ofpermanent missions in New York. We will continue to tryand enhance political support for our ideas  which we hopecan make a contribution to the effectiveness of ourOrganization in the future."
"99",4170,"LKA",53,1998,"At the outset Mr. President  let me extend to you Sri Lanka’s warmestcongratulations on your well-deserved election. We wishyou well and have no doubt that you will guide the workof this session with wisdom  skill and commitment.The Assembly owes a debt of gratitude to HisExcellency Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko for his wise andastute leadership as President of the General Assembly atits fifty-second session.22This year Sri Lanka celebrates the golden jubilee of itsindependence. We reclaimed our freedom in 1948  endingnearly five centuries of colonial domination. We have givenshelter within our land to all the great religions of theworld: Buddhism  Hinduism  Islam and Christianity. We area multiethnic and multicultural society. We are deeplycommitted to the democratic way of life. Our people haveexercised universal adult franchise since 1931. We have aparliamentary system of government  with elections heldregularly  where voter participation is uniquely high — asmuch as 80 per cent on average. We have an independentjudiciary and free media. The rule of law is observed andrespected. Fundamental rights are guaranteed and renderedjusticiable. We are constantly alert to the protection ofhuman rights  even in the face of grave provocation fromsome lawless elements that are bent on destroying ourdemocratic society.Shortly after the achievement of its independence  SriLanka became a member of the United Nations. In thepreamble to the Charter  the founding fathers expressedtheir determination to save succeeding generations from thescourge of war. They reaffirmed their faith in fundamentalhuman rights. They pledged to establish an environment inwhich international law and treaty obligations would beobserved  and to promote the economic and social progressof all peoples. The United Nations has succeeded inkeeping its basic promise of saving the world from theholocaust of a global conflict.But more than 50 years after the Charter was written we cannot conclude that the world today is a safer placethan it was when the United Nations was founded. Globalnuclear disarmament remains a distant dream. Nuclearweapons and weapons of mass destruction have proliferatedwith no concern for the safety of humankind despite theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons andthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Members ofthe nuclear club that possess these weapons show noinclination to dismantle them even though the cold war hasended and conflicts between States have lessened. TheUnited Nations has the responsibility to redouble its effortsto achieve global disarmament. That is a duty we owe tomankind  to unborn generations. We do not accept thethesis that these weapons are safe in the hands of some.The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has beendemanding for a long time that the Conference onDisarmament should establish  as its highest priority  acommittee to commence negotiations on a programme forthe complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a timebound framework.In 1976 my mother  Mrs. Sirimavo R. D.Bandaranaike  addressing the Assembly as Prime Ministerof Sri Lanka and chairperson of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  spoke of disarmament in the followingwords:“General and complete disarmament has beena declared objective of the United Nations and of theinternational community for nearly three decades.“Despite many initiatives taken by thisOrganization ... the world has witnessed not even thesemblance of disarmament but a race for supremacyin destructive power  based on the myth that peacecan be preserved only by strident and single-mindedpreparations for war and the refinement andsophistication of its techniques. It is  indeed  a sadreflection on the moral and intellectual standards ofthe twentieth century and of its values and prioritiesthat so much of the world’s resources  which mighthave been devoted to the eradication of poverty ignorance  disease and hunger  are being [wasted on]the production of monstrous weapons ...“[We] do not accept the thesis thatdisarmament is the special preserve of Powers thatpossess the paraphernalia of war. Every nation andevery individual has a right to peace  and just aspeace is indivisible so is the responsibility for itspreservation. Hence the call of the non-alignednations for a special session of the GeneralAssembly devoted to disarmament and agreement fora world conference.” (A/31/PV.11  paras. 37-39)At the recently concluded Non-Aligned MovementSummit  held in South Africa under the chairmanship ofPresident Nelson Mandela  the Movement once againexpressed its preoccupation with the issue of globalnuclear disarmament. In the years ahead the clamour fordisarmament among the great majority of nations willgrow in volume. The Non-Aligned Movement hasconsistently called for the Geneva-based Conference onDisarmament to establish  as the highest priority  an adhoc committee to commence negotiations on a programmefor the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within atime-bound framework. In addition  there is also aproposal for a nuclear weapons convention. We have toaddress these challenges as we approach the newmillennium. The longer we shirk our responsibility  thegreater the danger that looms ahead.23Today I have the honour and privilege of addressingthe Assembly as the newly appointed chairperson of theSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation(SAARC)  which met in Colombo a few months ago.SAARC represents one fifth of humanity. South Asia is heirto a rich and complex plurality of cultural and religioustraditions of great antiquity.Like any other association of sovereign States  wehave our share of problems. But I wish to convey myconfident belief that our summit meetings last year and thisyear have marked a turning point in the life of ourassociation. Our leaders are aware of the awesomeobligations that we jointly owe to the hundreds of millionsof people who inhabit our region. We are determined to putaside the political differences that bedevil relations amongsome of us  in a common and united effort to improve thequality of life of our peoples.The message I bring from the Colombo Summit is thatthe prospects for enhanced economic  technological  socialand scientific cooperation in our region are exceedinglybright. It is the will of our leaders  as vigorously manifestedat the Colombo Summit. I am deeply indebted to my fellowHeads of State and Government for their invaluable adviceand cooperation  and especially to the Prime Ministers ofIndia and Pakistan for the magnificent spirit of friendshipand understanding they showed for the collective regionalinterests and concerns.SAARC too  like the Non-Aligned Movement recognizes that the twin currents of globalization andliberalization which are swirling around us contain both thepotential for prosperity as well as the seed of a dangerousnew process of uneven development. It must beremembered that developing countries need specialconsideration in regard to the problems they face inglobalizing their economies.However  what is abundantly clear is that not a singleState  not even the most powerful  can hope to remainimmune from economic disease and contagion. Rippleshave spread widely from the economic upheavals of EastAsia and Russia. The maladies that spring from economicglobalization require remedies which are global in scope remedies which must take account of the ailments of allStates and not be based solely on the prescriptionsadvanced by those who may seem to be secure.United Nations bodies must play a critical role in allthis  particularly by facilitating and fostering internationalcooperation for equitable development that could resist theeconomic contagion that now afflicts us. The internationalmonetary mechanism has proved desperately inadequatein handling the recent crises. We now have to think interms of a new financial architecture to obtain radicalreforms of the international monetary system. This shouldaim at achieving a balance between the adjustmentsdemanded as against available financing.I wish to propose three areas of action that meritserious consideration: first  that a “lender of last resort”facility must be formulated to meet the problems ofvolatile capital movements; secondly  that effectiveinternational surveillance devices must be designed toanticipate problems before the demolition squads ofspeculators move in; and thirdly  that the resumption ofthe Special Drawing Rights of the International MonetaryFund (IMF) be a vital requirement of the proposedrestructuring. The major voting Powers of the IMF  aswell as the developing nations  will have to considerlarger allocations than are now contemplated. In themeantime  we should beware of attempts to liberalizecapital accounts before the modernization of nationalfinancial structures and the reforms of the internationalmonetary system are in place.A constructive dialogue between developed anddeveloping countries must be pursued on the basis ofmutual benefit and shared responsibilities. Closerconsultation should be promoted between groups like theGroup of 7  the G-77 and the G-15.Institutions such as the World Trade Organizationmust live up to their declared aims and genuinelyfacilitate a transparent  rule-based trading system thatwould permit stable growth. The United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)should not be neglected. It should be strengthened as thefocal point in the United Nations family for the integratedconsideration of issues of trade  finance  technology andinvestment.More funds for development activity need to bediverted from the United Nations administrative budget.The United Nations Agenda for Development  which waslaunched with great expectations  seems to be losingmomentum. Its implementation should not be delayed.Development is not merely a matter of economicgrowth and financial enrichment  to be measured instatistics  which can sometimes be misleading andillusory. The totality of the human condition must beenhanced and improved. Our commitment and24responsibility towards economic and social developmentshould not be minimized and made secondary to otherissues which  though important  do not touch on the well-being of humanity. It is a grievous indictment on us that theage-old problems of grinding poverty and starvation stillexist in today’s world. I appeal to the assembled nations notto allow ourselves to be beguiled or dazzled by theexplosion of exciting new technologies  the seductiveblandishments of global trade and high finance to the extentthat the poor  the deprived  the desperate fall away fromour agenda into the limbo of forgotten things. We must notforget that the least developed countries have specialproblems that cry out for attention. We must strivemightily  relentlessly  to banish these problems in the nextcentury.The G-77 has proposed that a third world summit beheld in the year 2000 to mark the dawn of the new century.Sri Lanka supports the proposal as an opportunity fordeveloping countries to chart their own agenda fordevelopment in the new era.The countries of SAARC agreed at Colombo that tocomplement economic progress  a Social Charter should bedrawn up for the benefit of our peoples in South Asia. Thiswould focus on determining practical  basic norms in theareas of poverty eradication  the empowerment of women the mobilization of youth  the promotion of health andnutrition  and the protection of children.We must make a special effort to dissipate the effectsof the discriminatory  social and psychological perceptionsthat affect the status of women. The SAARC heads of Stateor Government condemned violence against women as wellas acts of discrimination and humiliation which furtherdepress the dignity of women. There was particular concernover the plight of women and girl children caught insituations of armed conflict.In Colombo  the SAARC States finalized the draft textof a regional convention on combating the crime oftrafficking in women and children for prostitution  whichwill be signed at the next summit in Nepal. Within SriLanka  my Government has adopted a national plan ofaction based on the relevant conclusions of the FourthWorld Conference on Women  held in Beijing  and on thespecifics of our own national situation. The Constitution ofSri Lanka enshrines the fundamental right of equalitybetween the sexes. We have ratified International LabourOrganization (ILO) Conventions guaranteeing equalremuneration and other benefits to women. We havestrengthened legal provisions against harassment andsexual abuse of women.With regard to children  my Government hasrecently passed legislation to set up a National ChildProtection Authority directly under my supervision. ThisAuthority deals with such issues as child employment  thesexual exploitation of children  education  health and theplight of children trapped in armed conflict. We haveformulated a “Children’s Charter” and a National Plan ofAction to provide for the safety and protection of ourchildren. While we are conscious of the tragic incidenceof child prostitution and pornography in our country  wehave also traced the insidious international linkages whichaggravate the problem further. We urge the internationalcommunity to tighten laws and enforcement mechanismsto ensure that those responsible for such heinous crimeswill not receive refuge anywhere.A particularly cruel offence against the innocence ofchildren is their forced recruitment by a terrorist group inSri Lanka to serve as suicide killers in the name of acause they are too young even to comprehend.This is just one sordid aspect of the activities of aterrorist group known as the Tamil Tigers — or theLTTE. They seek to dismember Sri Lanka  with theobjective of creating in our land a monoethnic and racistentity — an objective totally unacceptable to theoverwhelming majority in the country and even to thevery community whose cause the LTTE claims torepresent.We believe that ethnic grievances exist in Sri Lanka.I said so in my address to the nation at the fiftiethanniversary celebrations of our independence this year. Isaid that the golden jubilee of independence was anoccasion for reflection  as well as the renewal of hopesand aspirations. It was an occasion to savour applause forour achievements and also to rue the consequences offailure. I said:“We must also with humility examine our failures.We have failed in the essential task of nation-building. We have meandered and faltered along thatpath  whilst among our neighbours in Asia and inmany other countries  peoples of various racial religious and linguistic communities live inharmony. The causes of this failure will be judgedby history. Others will apportion and assign blame.25“Let us  those of us who have undertaken theresponsibility to guide and govern the Nation  marchtowards the future in unison  putting behind us meandesires for petty personal or political gain. TheNation’s need today is so great and urgent that itpermits space only for largesse of heart and mind which will supersede in the national interest all that isirrelevant and small.”My Government is firmly committed to redressingethnic grievances peacefully through political discussion.We have presented a comprehensive proposal foraddressing the ethnic grievances through a wide devolutionof political power. The vast majority of our people  of allcommunities  have welcomed these proposals. Only theLTTE chooses to prowl the path of violence  resorting toterror to achieve goals which it alone espouses. However we have kept the doors open to the LTTE to join other SriLankans in negotiating a settlement of all outstanding ethnicissues if it eschews terrorism and its bloody call for aseparate State.The LTTE claims to be a “liberation organization”while it murders hundreds upon hundreds of the Tamilpeople it claims to liberate when they disagree with theLTTE’s terror politics. Several Tamil leaders of democraticpolitical parties  including members of parliament and twomayors  as well as Tamil human rights activists  have beenbrutally murdered by the LTTE. Its claim to be a“liberation organization” is negated by its unilateral resortto violence and its constant refusal to put its claims to thetrue test — that of participating in an open  democratic peaceful process of consultation with the people.By contrast  in Palestine  Chairman Arafat pursueswhat he calls “the peace of the brave”  confident not onlyof the justice of his cause  but also of the strength ofsupport freely given by the Palestinian people to achievetheir inalienable right in Palestine. During the SAARCsummit  we expressed growing concern at numeroussetbacks affecting the peace process in the Middle East including illegal attempts to change the jurisdiction and theborders of Jerusalem.Over the past few years the Government of Sri Lankahas in various international forums strongly advocated theneed for collective international action in order to overcomethe scourge of terrorism. Our reasoning has been that agroup like the ruthless LTTE  which continues to frustrateevery effort at finding a negotiated political settlement toour ethnic problem  has found sustenance in the liberalasylum policies that prevail in some countries. This group which recruits children as young as 10 years indiscriminately targets innocent civilians  assassinates theelected representatives of the people  including Tamilpolitical and human rights leaders  destroys places ofreligious worship and assassinates foreign heads ofGovernment on their soil  is permitted to operate freely inmany countries. It maintains an international networkwhich engages in fund-raising  narcotics trafficking  tradein illicit arms  the smuggling of illegal immigrants and  inmore recent times  maritime and cyber-terrorism.Addressing the United Nations fiftieth anniversarycelebrations in New York three years ago  I observed:“Concerted international action is essential to combatterrorism and to compel the terrorists to renounceviolence and enter the democratic process.Unfortunately  effective action to that end has beenfrustrated through sterile philosophical debate aboutthe nature of terrorism.” (A/50/PV.35  p. 9)I am happy to note that since then significantmeasures have been taken. The adoption of the UnitedNations International Convention for the Suppression ofTerrorist Bombings earlier this year has been aconsiderable moral victory for the internationalcommunity in its fight against terrorism. Sri Lanka ishopeful that all States will speedily take steps toimplement the necessary domestic legislation  aimed atgiving effect to the commitments made in the Convention to ensure that terrorists are neither provided safe havennor permitted to raise funds within the borders of oneState to sustain terrorist activities in another State.While we enact legislation  we must also be eternallyvigilant to ensure that terrorists do not find loopholes inour laws to circumvent the emerging internationalconsensus against terrorism. We are particularly consciousof the capacity of terrorist groups to resort to the strategyof using front organizations for raising funds which endup in the LTTE war chest to contribute towardsmurdering and brutalizing our people. Moral and legalsanctions against terrorists are not enough. Laws must beeffectively implemented. Only by such concerted actionshall we be able to ensure that terrorists are compelled torenounce violence and enter the democratic process.Here I would like to thank India and the UnitedStates of America  in particular  for having recognizedand declared the LTTE to be the terrorist organizationthat it is  as well as for encouraging my Government tosettle this problem by political means. I would like to add26here that this is an internal problem that Sri Lanka is fullyable and ready to resolve  with the full support of itspeoples. We will not tolerate any outside interference  whilewe appreciate all the support given us by our friends abroadin resolving this conflict.If at this stage I mention Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi ofMyanmar it is because I am personally aware of theloneliness  the anguish  the difficulties and dangers that awoman leader faces in political life. The people of SriLanka and the people of Myanmar and their Governmentshave been friends over many centuries. Our peoples sharean invaluable heritage — the timeless message of theBuddha  the enlightened one who taught the world themeaning of compassion  tolerance and understanding. Thismessage moves me to express the hope that political issuesin Myanmar may be approached in a spirit of conciliationand tolerance.In all this  a catalytic role can and must be played bythe United Nations system. The United Nations has passedits half-century mark. The Secretary-General has describedthe United Nations as “a noble experiment in humancooperation”. Last year was designated the year of UnitedNations reform  and we are happy that a major portion ofthe reforms introduced have been implemented. Someothers require further study.We are aware of the financial crisis the United Nationsis facing due to the default of certain Member States inpaying their contributions. We urge them to pay their duesfully  without conditions and on time.We are disappointed that agreement has not beenreached over the reconstitution of the Security Council toreflect better the generality of United Nations membership.The Council should be more representative  and itsdeliberations more transparent and democratic  thusresponding to the concerns of all and shedding its image not entirely inaccurate  of largely serving the interests ofthe major Powers.In the closing years of the present millennium  theworld is a far more complex place than it was when theUnited Nations Charter was adopted. The range andramifications of the issues with which the Organizationmust contend have dramatically increased. Change in theorientation of the United Nations must keep pace with newrealities. The Secretary-General’s Programme for Reformis a step in the right direction. Yet nothing will contributemore to the success of the United Nations than the extentof Member States’ commitment to the Organization’sdecisions. The credibility and strength of those decisionswill itself depend on the transparency of the decision-making process and on how closely Member Statesidentify with those decisions. If the United Nations is tocontinue on its voyage into the twenty-first century withrenewed vigour  to achieve its objectives of peace security  economic development and social reform  all itsMembers must be empowered to participate meaningfullyand at every level of the decision-making process.To this end  two important reforms must be placedon our agenda. First  the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil so that it will more fully represent two thirds ofthe world populace is an indispensable requirement. Thedeveloping nations and the regions of the world in whichthey predominate must have permanent representation onthe Security Council.Secondly  the crucial role of the General Assemblyin the decision-making process of the United Nationsmust be recognized and guaranteed. The United NationsGeneral Assembly is the supreme parliament of mankind.Today the era of the cold war is over. Economicglobalization is breaking down national boundaries to anextent that would have been unimaginable a few decadesago. The world is truly on the threshold of a new orderwhich surely cannot be driven any more by the narrownational concerns that have paralysed the imagination ofmankind for so long. Never before in human history havewe been presented with the stupendous possibilities thatsurround us today of breaking the mundane bonds thatbind us to banality and triviality. When the unconquered unconquerable spirit of mankind is allowed to soar to itsfull potential we will achieve a world in which truth andjustice prevail  a world which we can proudly bequeath tothe unborn generations of our peoples.Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike  my latefather  addressing this Assembly at its eleventh session  in1956  spoke as follows:“In an Organization such as this  the service that acountry can render ... is not to be measured alone bythe size of that country  its population  its power orits strength. This is an Organization which expressesitself most effectively by bringing to bear a certainmoral force — the collective moral force anddecency of human beings. That is a task in whichthe weak as well as the strong can render a usefulservice  and I give the Assembly the assurance  onbehalf of my country  that as far as we are27concerned  every endeavour that we can make in allsincerity to assist in the achievements of those nobleideals for which this Organization stands will alwaysbe forthcoming in the fullest measure.” (A/PV.590 para. 42)Addressing this Assembly 42 years later  I make boldto say that Sri Lanka remains a loyal and dedicatedMember of this Organization. We have made a contributionto the quality of its deliberations and to the implementationof its programmes. We are deeply committed to theprinciples of the Charter. We believe in the United Nations.We want it to be a strong  principled and effective body the common inheritance of all mankind  not the preserve ofa few wealthy and powerful States  but the guardian of all especially the poor  the weak and the defenceless."
"100",4212,"LSO",53,1998,"I should like  Mr. President to extend to you our very warm congratulations on yourelection to lead the business of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session. Your election bears testimony to thevery high esteem in which we hold you and your country.You can count on our unstinting support and cooperationduring the year that lies ahead. Through you  Sir  permitme also to salute your very worthy predecessor  Mr.Hennadiy Udovenko  the former Foreign Minister ofUkraine  for the illustrious manner in which he led theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session.In your address at the opening of this session Mr. President  you challenged us to focus our attention onthe major issues of our time. The list of issues that youprovided was comprehensive  but I wish here to highlightonly some of them — without passing judgment on theirrelative worth.The Secretary-General has submitted a report oncauses of conflict in Africa at the request  last year  of theSecurity Council. It is an excellent report  for which theSecretary-General should be commended. The recentevents in Lesotho  to a large measure  fit in with theSecretary-General?s diagnosis. Nothing could be closer tothe truth than the Secretary-General?s observation that“Where there is insufficient accountability ofleaders  lack of transparency in regimes  inadequatechecks and balances  non-adherence to the rule oflaw  absence of peaceful means to change or replaceleadership  or lack of respect for human rights political control becomes excessively important  andthe stakes become dangerously high”. (A/52/871 para. 12)Our recent experience in Lesotho is that instability islikely to arise even when Governments are deeplyconscious of the need to abide by those prescriptions  ifother political players are not similarly committed tothem.On 23 May 1998  a general election was held inLesotho under the management of an IndependentElectoral Commission established with the fullcooperation of all political parties. The Commission  anew institution in the history of Lesotho  was withoutprevious experience. The elections were observed by 400local and 150 international observers  including observersfrom the United Nations  all of whom declared them freeand fair. Soon afterwards  however  three of the 12opposition parties alleged that the Lesotho Congress forDemocracy had won through fraud. Vice-President ThaboMbeki of South Africa attempted to mediate in thisdispute  and all the parties agreed to an audit of the9election results  conducted by the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC)  in order to determinethe existence or otherwise of fraud. The Commission ofInvestigation  which came to be known as the LangaCommission after its Chairman  Justice Pius Langa of SouthAfrica  found that  while there had been administrativeirregularities  there had been no fraud and the electionscould not be said not to represent the will of the electorate.But even in the absence of fraud  the oppositionparties still insisted on the resignation of the Government the dissolution of Parliament and the establishment by theKing of a government of national unity in which all themajor parties would be equally represented. In an attemptto achieve this  the opposition parties perpetratedlawlessness  which resulted in an army mutiny  the forcedand illegal dismissal of the command structure by juniorofficers  and open support by those junior officers for theopposition-led civil unrest in preparation for an illegaltakeover of the Government.It was in this state of virtual coup d?état that theLesotho Prime Minister appealed to the Presidents ofBotswana  Mozambique  South Africa and Zimbabwe formilitary assistance to restore law and order and to enforcediscipline in the Lesotho army. The responsibility wasshouldered by the SADC member States Botswana andSouth Africa on behalf of the entire SADC. While theseSADC troops were busy neutralizing the army mutiny andthe virtual coup  the supporters of opposition partiesembarked on a campaign of arson and looting in the centralbusiness district of the capital  Maseru  which later spreadto other towns of the country.Although the full extent of the damage to businessinfrastructure is not yet known with certainty  preliminaryestimates put it at above $200 million. For a small leastdeveloped country like Lesotho  such an amount is a heavyburden on an already fragile economy. The Government ofLesotho therefore appeals to the international communityfor assistance in rebuilding the infrastructure that has beenso wantonly destroyed.We have already made contacts with the World Bankfor a more precise assessment of our needs in this regard and once these are known we shall be making a morefocused appeal. Above and beyond the assistance withphysical reconstruction  it is quite clear that the type ofassistance which the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) and some bilateral donors were givingto reorient the minds of our army has not yet had a lastingimpact. Lesotho has had a sad history of an army that wasdeliberately filled with supporters of one political partywhen that party was in power for over 20 years. As aconsequence  our army has had great difficulty insubmitting to the authority of a new master. Recentevents have underscored the urgent need to overhaul theLesotho army  as was done under internationalsupervision in Haiti.Furthermore  all political parties need to submitthemselves to the discipline and responsibilities that aredemanded of them as actors in the democratic system.This includes the acceptance of defeat in generalelections. Otherwise  those politicians who deliberatelyundermine the democratic culture should be exposed andofficially branded by the international community ascriminals  as the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) has done with Savimbi in Angola.Since 1993  Lesotho has been embarked on aprogramme of entrenching democracy  the rule of law andrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Thecurrent crisis has amply demonstrated how difficult it isto make people whose only preoccupation is theachievement of personal political power participate in thisprocess.The Government of Lesotho is grateful for thesupport of the countries of SADC in once again reversinga coup in Lesotho. SADC has given practical expressionto what has become an all-Africa commitment to theabhorrence of military overthrow of legitimateGovernments  such as occurred recently in Sierra Leoneand the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The extent of recent lawlessness in Lesotho hasunderscored the need to control the illicit possession ofsmall arms and light weapons. In Lesotho recently  youngpeople  many of them in their teens  were able tointimidate law-abiding citizens with guns and to forcethem to surrender Government property and to evacuateGovernment offices and private industrial enterprises.Small arms and light weapons have become socommonplace that they have encouraged habitual recourseto violence  thus threatening the cohesion and well-beingof many societies. These low-tech  inexpensive and easyto use weapons — numbering hundreds of millions —cause as much as 90 per cent of the deaths incontemporary conflicts. Their proliferation contributes toviolence  loss of life and property  social instability  thedisruption of economic development and the threat todemocratic governance.10During the cold war  arms control and disarmamentefforts focused exclusively on major weapons systems  suchas tanks  jet fighters and nuclear weapons. Although thishas begun to change in recent years  there are still nointernational standards regarding small arms. Theirproduction  trade and possession remain essentiallyunmonitored and unregulated. Lesotho therefore stronglysupports current efforts to find an international solution tothese problems posed by the unregulated proliferation ofillicit small arms and light weapons.The Government of Lesotho is understandablydisappointed that its efforts to build and consolidate aculture of democratic governance seem to have suffered asetback  especially this year  when we are celebrating thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. However  Lesotho will not be deflected from thepath it has chosen of moving forward to truly democraticgovernance in which all citizens enjoy their right topolitical freedom and personal happiness.Fifty years ago  the peoples of the world set downstandards for their security  happiness and well-being in theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. In the interveningperiod  the international community and the United Nationshave made great strides in the area of human rights. Ofgreat significance are the major human rights treaties whichhave been adopted and which include the Convention onthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Thebattle to make human rights truly universal has regrettablynot been won decisively  although there is no doubt that weare on the way to achieving that goal. We therefore need toredouble our efforts to pursue it.In the post-cold-war era  attention has unfortunatelybeen focused almost exclusively on civil and politicalrights  with less attention being paid to economic  socialand cultural rights. That development is a human right isoften forgotten. Such a narrow approach misses theimportant link that exists between the enjoyment of civiland political rights and development. The Declaration onthe Right to Development was intended to emphasize sucha link but  regrettably  this latest of recognized rights hasyet to be factored into our human rights programmes.As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  no topic is ofgreater significance than the establishment of a permanentInternational Criminal Court. Over 50 years ago  this ideawas conceived out of the realization that domestic courtsare often inadequate to deter crimes under international law resulting in impunity for perpetrators of human rightsabuses. The adoption of the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court less than three months agowas the culmination of a long battle fought by courageousmen and women for justice. The Statute is therefore ourproud bequest to future generations.Over the years of negotiation on the Rome Statute Lesotho always affirmed the need for a court in which wecould have faith: an effective  independent and impartialCourt that enjoyed universal acceptance. In order toachieve this  a number of thorny and sensitive issues hadto be resolved over the five-week period of the RomeConference. While not everything that we had hoped forhas been included in the Statute  we believe that thepositive aspects of the Statute far outweigh its negativeelements.If  in the years ahead  there is to be greater respectfor international law and international humanitarian law all States will have to take the International CriminalCourt seriously and adopt measures to ensure the cominginto operation of the court without delay. We thus urgethe Secretary-General to convene the PreparatoryCommission in early 1999 to begin work on the rules ofprocedure and evidence  guidelines for the court on theelements of crimes  the headquarters agreement and otherinstruments. We also call upon the Assembly to endorsethe Rome Statute and urge States to ratify it in sufficientnumbers so that the court can start its work. Lesothoremains ready to work towards the accomplishment ofthese tasks.During the current session of the General Assemblyand the twelfth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement recently held in Durban  South Africa  the concern of theinternational community has focused on the phenomenonof globalization  an issue of particular importance for theleast developed countries. The liberalization of traderegimes and the promotion of an open and securemultilateral trading system are central requirements forthe promotion of economic development.While the Uruguay Round of multilateral tradenegotiations has resulted in significant improvements inmarket access conditions for the majority of countries ofthe world  the expected gains for the least developedcountries from the stimulus to world trade arising fromthe Uruguay Round are less clear. These countriescontinue to face significant obstacles to market access fortheir exports. There are still tariff peaks and tariffescalations against their major export items. Furthermore 11some standards are too difficult to meet due to thedifferences in technological advancement.The problems enumerated above attest to theimportance of the United Nations in shaping a world ofpeace  prosperity and development. A question that hasplagued the United Nations since its founding has been thatof disarmament  and in particular nuclear disarmament.Nuclear weapons pose a serious threat to all humanity andits habitat  yet they remain in the arsenals built up duringthe height of the cold war. Their time has passed  yetassertions of their utility continue. Nuclear weapons areheld by a handful of States which insist that these weaponsprovide security benefits  and yet reserve uniquely tothemselves the right to own them. This situation is highlydiscriminatory  unstable and untenable. The possession ofnuclear weapons by any State is a constant stimulus toother States to acquire them. For these reasons  it is acentral reality that nuclear weapons diminish the security ofall States.The recent testing of nuclear weapons by India andPakistan was a self-fulfilling prophecy. As much as wedeplore the measures taken by these two countries  we mustnot lose sight of the fact that they have been led down thatpath by the resistance of nuclear-weapons States to fulfiltheir obligations towards negotiating in good faith for atotal ban of all nuclear weapons. We call upon all nuclear-weapons States to respond to the wishes of all humanity toban nuclear weapons from human experience by negotiatinga binding treaty for such a ban.Lesotho supports the efforts of the Secretary-Generaltowards reforming the United Nations Organization. Thereis general agreement that the Security Council must bemade more democratic and its working methods moretransparent. For the great majority of States  the UnitedNations is an indispensable tool for the realization of ourdream for collective security and development. We aretherefore troubled that the efforts to reform theOrganization are bogged down in the most crucial area namely  the reform of the Security Council. The Charterhas conferred on that organ the most importantresponsibility for international peace and security. TheWorking Group on Security Council reform has beenworking for almost five years without reaching aconclusion. The time has now come for a negotiating textto be prepared and for negotiations to commence.Otherwise  the whole exercise will turn into a charade inwhich all will lose interest.The scourge of conflicts in Africa continues toundermine efforts towards economic and socialdevelopment in that continent. Lesotho is deeplyconcerned by the failure of UNITA to comply with theagreed timetable for the resolution of the conflict inAngola  in accordance with the provisions of the LusakaProtocol and the relevant Security Council resolutions.We thus call on the international community  and theSecurity Council in particular  to assume its responsibilityto apply firmly and resolutely the measures decreed bythe Council  especially within the context of resolutions1135 (1997) and 1173 (1998). Lesotho  as a member ofSADC  supports the resolution of the recent SADCsummit in Mauritius  which held Mr. Savimbi accountablefor the resumption of hostilities in that country and thusdeclared him a political criminal.The situation in the Democratic Republic of theCongo is another source of concern to the Government ofLesotho. This situation has seriously jeopardized effortsat consolidating peace  security and stability in the GreatLakes region. Lesotho supports all efforts aimed atpromoting a climate of peace and security in that region including the SADC initiative as carried out byZimbabwe  Namibia and Angola.Finally  we remain disappointed by the slow pace ofefforts at finding a lasting solution to the long-runningproblem of Western Sahara. We therefore appeal to allparties concerned to respect and commit themselves to theletter and spirit of the United Nations settlement plan within the context of the Houston accord  so that thepeople of Western Sahara can at last join the rest of theinternational community as a peaceful  democratic andstable society as we move across the threshold of the nextmillennium."
"101",4238,"LTU",53,1998,"First  let me congratulate you Sir  on your election to the presidency of this importantsession. I am certain that this session will provide us withthe opportunity to discuss the role that the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights has played during the last50 years and has yet to play.I should also like to take this opportunity to conveymy respects to the Secretary-General  who  by hisdecisive steps in critical moments this year  hasrepeatedly demonstrated the importance of the UnitedNations in contemporary world affairs.Throughout the last 50 years the United Nations haschanged no less dynamically than the rest of thesurrounding world. Reviewing the successes and failuresof the Organization  we have to acknowledge its complexand important role in building a more peaceful world. TheUnited Nations at present is living through a complicatedperiod of internal reform designed to reinforce the valuesand principles which half a century ago encouraged theStates of the world to sign the Charter establishing theUnited Nations  which guides us today into the twenty-first century. I speak of peace  democracy and theenvironment and of ensuring and promoting thedevelopment of freedom of the individual.This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of theadoption by the General Assembly of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. This crucial instrumentdeclares the will of the people of the world to establish auniversal understanding of individual freedom  equality anddignity  which are indivisible and must not be undermined.Today we should be particularly concerned to what extentthe principles declared by the United Nations throughoutthe last 50 years have become the bedrock of our everydaylife. It would be most appropriate to ask whether the UnitedNations has become an Organization of world nations ratherthan States.In the contemporary world of advancedcommunications  the exchange of values and ideas takesplace at a particularly high speed. It is therefore notsurprising that freedom  justice and well-being carry thesame meaning in Europe and Asia  Africa and America. Ibelieve we are approaching a common denominator fordemocracy so that democracy will no longer be identifiedonly with the West and rapid economic development onlywith certain regions of the world. Above all  we hope thatthe realization of human rights throughout the world isconsistent with the spirit of the Declaration of HumanRights signed 50 years ago.In the cold-war world of divided ideologies  theUnited Nations was one of the very few forums embodyingthe common human interest: the concern for peace. Todaythe United Nations can contribute considerably to thecreation and education of free individuals and activecitizens of the world.History has proved that democratic and prosperousStates provide the most favourable environment for humanactivities. The United Nations should therefore continue itsefforts to promote democratization and sustainabledevelopment. The ongoing institutional reform of theOrganization may serve this end. However  I should likealso to underscore the need to pay even greater attention tothe promotion and protection of human rights.Willingly and freely we have empowered the SecurityCouncil to make binding decisions to which we are thencommitted. We therefore want the decisions to be of highquality  effective and acceptable. Two highly qualifiedindustrialized countries could become permanent membersof the Security Council; their membership would strengthenthe Council and ensure democratic decisions. A broaderrepresentation of developing nations on the Council wouldalso reinforce its legitimacy and enhance respect for it.These nations deserve additional seats  both permanent andnon-permanent. Equitable representation in the Councilshould be expanded through a more just representation ofregions  Central and Eastern Europe in particular.The United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights  Mary Robinson  has noted that todayâs humanrights violations are the causes of tomorrowâs conflicts.War-ravaged Bosnia and conflict-inflamed Kosovo todayare painful illustrations of these words. Lithuaniawelcomes the initiative of Secretary-General Kofi Annanto integrate human rights protection into the broad rangeof the Organizationâs activities. We likewise welcome theongoing institutional reforms of human rights protectionand propose to employ with greater effectiveness theexperience and intellectual potential of such regionalbodies as the Council of Europe and the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe.One of the most laudable recent achievements of theworldâs nations is the adoption of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court. By taking this decision  theinternational community demonstrated its readiness for aqualitative leap in international relations based on aneffective system of international justice â€” an instrumentdesigned to complement national legal systems and toencourage their continuous development.It is gratifying that the Court has been granted theright to charge persons with criminal responsibility for thegravest crimes of all: genocide  war crimes and crimesagainst humanity. This step demonstrates our resolutionto fight against the horrors for which there are no â€” andcannot be any â€” political or ideological boundaries.â€œCrime of aggressionâ€ in the Statute is a pending issuerequiring the political will of States and a more preciselegal definition. The bitter facts of modern history remindus that aggression too often leads to genocide  war crimesand crimes against humanity.I would like to note that Lithuania  which activelyparticipated in the work of the Preparatory Committee andthe Rome Conference  will in the near future sign theStatute of the International Criminal Court.Today we all face the challenges of ourcontemporary world which have been caused by rapidlydeveloping technologies and negligent human activities.These challenges  although not as evident as open militaryconflicts  are no less threatening. A devastated anddeteriorating environment may cause conflicts on a scaleunknown before. The struggle for fresh water  rich soiland natural resources can turn man against man and2nation against nation. Neither democratic political processesnor economic development will matter then.As a man with a long-standing commitment toenvironmental protection  I invite you to make use of theinternational capabilities of the United Nations and to paymore attention to ecological issues. If we are genuine in ourattempt to place this institution at the vanguard of humanrights protection  environmental issues should be givenpriority on our agenda. Lithuania will support everyinitiative to preserve and conserve natural resources. As onesuch step  I yesterday signed the Kyoto Protocol reaffirming our commitment to tackling global warming byreducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. Now we lookforward to decisive action on climate change in BuenosAires later this year.Every individual has the incontestable right to live ina healthy and clean environment. I am certain that theUnited Nations can play a significant role in promotingrespect for the environment among people and States of theworld. With its long experience in international cooperationand its prominent international standing  this Organizationcan contribute notably to the environmental education of theglobal community. It can also serve as a promoter of inter-State cooperation through the timely exchange ofinformation on disasters â€” past  present and future. ThePrior Informed Consent (PIC) Convention on trade inhazardous chemicals and pesticides  which was signed inRotterdam a couple of days ago  is a remarkable exampleof prospective activities of the United Nations system.The growing problems of international crime andterrorism affecting us are no less important thanenvironmental issues. Terrorist bombings and illicittrafficking in arms  narcotic substances and human beings as well as money laundering  infringe the vital interests ofpeople and States to live in a secure and predictable world.The solution to these problems demands collective effortsas well as resolute and immediate action. It is gratifyingthat the heads of State and Government  as well as interiorministers  confirmed their commitment to constructivecooperation at the twentieth special session of the UnitedNations General Assembly  on drugs. The approved drug-demand reduction and prevention programme  along withthe guidelines for international cooperation  should facilitatethe resolution of these problems.Children and young people â€” our future â€” should bethe focus of the fight against drug-trafficking. Timelyadoption and launching of preventive measures andeducational programmes  as well as the building of a drug-free environment  must be our immediate first steps. It isdelightful that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has shownparticular attention to this problem.Control of the arms trade  which is becomingincreasingly complex  is another painful reality facing usat the end of this century. Smugglers arm not onlyterrorists  but also nations or States at war. Without anyfurther delay we should forestall illicit arms circulationby  first and foremost  restricting the sale of small armsand light weapons in conflict zones. We should persist inour efforts to find an effective solution to the issue ofgeneral and complete disarmament.The nuclear arms race  which emerged in South Asiathis year  has revealed the survival of the cold warideology of the balance of powers in the political thinkingof certain States. Such reasoning is short onconstructiveness since it does not enhance internationalsecurity  and it diverts human resources and creativepowers into erroneous directions  undermining theaspirations of the individual to a safer and wealthier life.Lithuania is neither a zone of potential conflict nora place for the manufacturing or circulation ofconventional weapons or weapons of mass destruction.Nevertheless  Lithuania endeavours to participate activelyin different agreements on disarmament and arms controlthrough which it helps itself and others. My country hasratified the conventions prohibiting biological  chemicaland certain conventional weapons. Ratification of theconvention prohibiting anti-personnel mines is our long-term goal.It is my belief that the right of the individual to asecure life and future â€” a right still missing from theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights â€” fullycorresponds to the spirit of the Declaration and should berealized through our political initiatives. The security ofthe individual will be best ensured if the State he lives inis secure. Good neighbourly relations and close regionalcooperation are prerequisites for the peaceful coexistenceof nations  and all humankind aspires to this. Lithuania isguided by those principles and maintains friendly constructive relations with all its neighbours  Russiaamong them.The United Nations today acts not only in a multi-polar but also multi-problem environment. By itself it isnot capable of addressing and resolving all the problemswhich we often tend to call â€œhotâ€ issues and whichdemand immediate solutions. Therefore  the Organization3should interact with greater vigour in its endeavours withregional organizations that  in many cases  succeed in theareas where global forums fail. Europe has already providedus with an example of such productive interaction throughconcrete cooperation of the United Nations with theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).Europe  however  has other  smaller organizationswhich can also considerably contribute to the goals of theUnited Nations and to the implementation of their spirit.The Council of the Baltic Sea States  of which Lithuaniahas recently assumed the chairmanship  is one of them.This Council unites geographical neighbours who also enjoymany  more binding links: the promotion of mutualconfidence  trade  culture and environmental protection.During the term of its chairmanship  Lithuania will strivefor a more active and effective contribution of this regionalcooperation body to the implementation of the goals of theUnited Nations.The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights is a reminder of the indivisibility of thevalues of human life  dignity and welfare. Political activitiesat both the international and national levels should bedirected to promoting and protecting these values. More andmore threats to human rights and freedoms arise today fromsources beyond the control of national Governments. Neverbefore have the issues of coordination and enhancedcooperation been as crucial as they are today. The UnitedNations possesses all the potential necessary to perform therole of active international coordinator and peace promoter.But the realization of this potential requires determinationfrom us  the representatives of nations and members of theinternational community."
"102",4282,"LUX",53,1998,"As previous speakers have done  I would like toconvey to the President my sincerest congratulations onhis election to the presidency at the fifty-third session ofthe General Assembly. I am convinced that our Assemblywill benefit greatly from his sense of authority andleadership. I also wish to express my gratitude to hispredecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for hiscommitment and perseverance in conducting our workduring the fifty-second session.The Secretary-General of our Organization isdevoting tireless energy to opening up new avenues forour common efforts. He has emphasized the crucialimportance of good communications to ensure that theUnited Nations will be a catalyst both for those directlyinvolved in international life and for our peoples. Weshare that belief with him and encourage him in thatrespect.Last Tuesday  members heard the statement ofMr. Schüssel  President of the Council of the EuropeanUnion. He spoke on behalf of all of the countries of theEuropean Union  and Luxembourg fully supports theviews expressed.19The presence of representatives of 185 States in thisHall reflects our common concern to ensure balance andsecurity among nations  but also within our societies. Ourconcern is to ensure the permanence of values to which weare all committed in an ever-evolving world. In the contextof its mandate to preserve international peace and security our Organization regularly asks whether it has the means toensure that the general interest  as perceived by ourcitizens  prevails. Surely  we must not be overly ambitious.We are aware of the complexity and the magnitude of thesituations we face  and that these impose limits on ouraction. Therefore we must focus our operations and providean appropriate framework for them. It is also our duty toacquire the means to act effectively whenever ourineffectiveness or slow response would seem to negativelyaffect the weakest among us.Luxembourg supports the efforts under way to provideour Organization with permanent structures and to makeavailable to it forces prepared for rapid and effectiveintervention whenever the Security Council  guarantor ofthe preservation of peace and security  deems it necessary.Our common efforts to make our world safer suffereda serious setback following the nuclear tests recently carriedout by two major countries in South Asia. We noted withsatisfaction that the representatives of India and Pakistanhave just announced from this rostrum that their countriesare prepared to join the international community byacceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.We invite them to proceed in that direction as quickly aspossible.Will these efforts appear absurd  given the endlesspursuit of the tragic discussion about the disarmament ofIraq? This spring the Security Council endorsed thememorandum of understanding submitted to it following theSecretary-General?s visit to Baghdad. Since then  suchcooperation has been called into question. Such abruptchanges generate concern and discouragement and call intoquestion the credibility of our Organization. It is theSecurity Council?s responsibility to take the necessary stepsto ensure that its decisions in this area are fully respected.Our Organization is pursuing conflict prevention andpeacekeeping. At the recent meeting between the UnitedNations and the representatives of regional organizations the proposal for development of a culture of prevention wasput forward. Progress has been made in the concept ofmutually supportive institutions and on support for theinitiatives taken at the regional and subregional level.While it is desirable to support such initiatives andefforts  we must remember that the Charter confersprinciple responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security on the Security Counciland that the Council must fully play its role. We welcomethe fact that in 1998 the Council once again authorizedtwo peacekeeping operations  one in Sierra Leone and theother in the Central African Republic.The Ottowa conference on the prohibition of anti-personnel mines was undeniably an invigorating successin an area which constantly creates innocent victims. Thistreaty  which has just entered into force  will make itpossible to save many human lives. The news that anti-personnel mines are again being sown in Angola andalong the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslaviais terrifying. Such action  if confirmed  must becondemned vigorously.In Kosovo  the violence directed against the civilianpopulation must end. It proves that the Federal Republicof Yugoslavia continues to follow paths which cannot butcompromise progress in its integration into internationaland European structures. Armed action conducted byAlbanian groups in Kosovo must also end. The scorn forhuman suffering displayed by the Serbian leaders and theextremists in Kosovo is incomprehensible.A new status for Kosovo must emerge. It isinconceivable that such a status can emerge under thesway of threat or  even worse  cold-hearted implacableviolence  which would merely drive the wedge deeper tothe point where the very idea of understanding would beabsurd. As Security Council resolution 1199 (1998)requires  a political solution must be negotiated betweenthe parties under the aegis of the international community.Firm cohesion between Europe  the United States and theRussian Federation should enable those in the region  aswas the case previously  to address their future in a morerational and orderly way.In Bosnia and Herzegovina  the extremist tendenciesare on the decline. This political progress was rapidlyreflected in concrete results achieved in the field  andtoday this war-torn country is engaged in reconstruction.It is comforting to note that a growing number ofindividuals charged with war crimes have been sent to theTribunal at The Hague. The establishment and the20functioning of the structures decided on in the context ofthe peace process are today becoming a reality.The recent elections have confirmed this new realism.It is up to the international community to consolidate thistrend  as it still appears to be fragile  and to ensure  inparticular  the return of refugees and displaced persons.This latter question is particularly acute in Croatia andAlbania.Another key element for opening the way to a brighterfuture is a firm  unequivocal commitment by the regionalparties and the international community. I refer to the peaceprocess in the Middle East. Five years after the Osloagreements  we must note the stagnation of the peaceprocess  whose logic — the principle of land for peace —the current Israeli Government never really accepted.The archaic and paralysing philosophy of refusal hasunfortunately returned to the foreground; it is reflected inmany initiatives which only increase tension  thus nullifyingthe efforts of those who advocate peace. The politicalleaders involved must reverse this trend so as to return tothe good faith implementation of all the provisions of theOslo agreements.Our action  in that region and in others  must focus onconvincing the parties involved that there is no alternativeto peace.It is regrettable that this central concept is also beingcalled into question in a number of African regions. Tribalrivalries and resentments continue to supplantclearsightedness and the desire for good governance. In nocase should the political leaders involved in the differentflashpoints feel that their only choice is between submittingto events and shirking their responsibilities.The struggles for influence and the war in and aroundthe Democratic Republic of the Congo are on the verge ofdegenerating into a regional conflict and bringing about ahumanitarian catastrophe there too.The causes of conflicts and the promotion of peaceand sustainable development in Africa call for a unitedresponse. The debate at ministerial level that the SecurityCouncil has just held on these topics was very helpful. TheGeneral Assembly will have occasion to consider thisquestion over the course of its fifty-third session  with aview to a discussion on possible measures. While the futureof Africa depends first of all on the efforts of Africansthemselves  the international community must be activelyinvolved in order to ensure respect for international law and in order to carry out its duty of solidarity.Recent events  with the terrible bombings perpetratedin Africa and Northern Ireland  remind us once again ofthe intolerable nature of terrorism. It is up to theinternational community to acquire an effective means ofcombating this scourge on an international level  and toensure that the perpetrators of such acts answer for theircrimes before the competent courts. We owe it toourselves to put a definitive end to the culture ofimpunity in connection with terrorism.Another priority for our General Assembly is reformof the Organization. We welcome the fact that someprogress was made during the fifty-second session. Butreform cannot be an isolated event; it must become aprocess that underlies all of our action. We pledge tocontinue actively supporting the efforts of the Secretary-General  and to add our efforts to his  with a view togiving the United Nations the capacity to respond in aflexible and evolving way to the challenges of the twenty-first century.Any in-depth reform of the system will remainfragile so long as the Organization lacks sound andreliable financial resources. The grave financial crisiswhich the Organization has experienced for a number ofyears must be considered as a threat to the effectivenessof the whole. Our proposed reforms will be consolidatedonly when all Member States have agreed fully to meettheir obligations under the Charter by paying their arrearsto the United Nations  and by paying on time andunconditionally the full amount of their obligatorycontributions  both to the Organization?s regular budgetand to the peacekeeping budget.The maintenance of security and peace in the worldcannot be dissociated from the international community?sefforts on behalf of development.When we see entire regions  even subcontinents experiencing poverty and malnutrition  there is a shockingimbalance which will soon pose a threat to the security ofthe States concerned and to respect for the fundamentalrights of the human individual.When we see that generations of young people canhope for no future but unemployment or a frustratinginactivity  there exists a flagrant and unjust imbalancewhich will be a source of conflict.21When we see social categories permanently deprivedof education and health care  that  too  is an imbalance towhich we cannot be indifferent.The economic  financial and social crisis currentlybesetting South-East Asia  Latin America and Russia hasexacerbated this trend. Rationally  the internationalcommunity must acknowledge that the means ofintervention traditionally  and almost mechanically employed to overcome economic crises have provedineffective this time.In his work Civilisation matérielle  économie etcapitalisme  Fernand Braudel pointed out the profoundsource of this crisis:“the emergence of a savage capitalism  as distinctfrom what we consider to be a market economy”.A market economy  and particularly a social marketeconomy  cannot do without a stable State capable ofregulating competition and protecting the weak.The strengthening or restoration of a democratic working State in the countries in crisis seems to me to bean absolute priority.The international community cannot shirk theobligation to shoulder its responsibilities and lend a stronghand. It will do this not only because of its duty ofsolidarity  but because the interests of one and all arelinked.Another area in which the interdependence of ourobjectives is particularly visible and tangible is that of themanagement of the world?s natural resources. It is clear thatwe need to be ambitious when it comes to the long-termmanagement of our environment.Last year we met here in special session to undertakean initial evaluation of the implementation of thecommitments undertaken at the Conference on Environmentand Development a little over six years ago. At Rio deJaneiro and during last year?s evaluation session we definedthe concept of a world partnership for sustainabledevelopment  a partnership respecting the fact that theprotection of the environment cannot be dissociated fromthe economic and social development process.Undeniable progress has been made in recent years:the entry into force of the Framework Convention onClimate Change  the Convention on Biological Diversityand the Convention to Combat Desertification. But it mustbe acknowledged that the world environment hascontinued to deteriorate.Accordingly  it is essential to accelerate theimplementation of Agenda 21  the programme of actionadopted in Rio de Janeiro.Luxembourg intends to shoulder its share of thisresponsibility. Accordingly  we have undertaken  in thecontext of the commitments made by the European Unionat the Kyoto Conference  to reduce our emissions of sixgreenhouse gases to 28 per cent below 1990 levels by theyear 2012.In the context of the Biodiversity Convention  wealso plan to establish a national network of protectedareas covering 10 per cent of our national territory.The goal of managing the world?s material resourcesas a good parent would reflect an atavistic concern  thatof guaranteeing security through careful preparation forthe future  in particular through suitable education.The recent Lisbon Conference devoted to theproblems faced by young people rightly emphasized theneed to provide training that is suited to the job market soas to prevent unemployment and marginalization. Suchtraining must include education about responsibility. Wetherefore welcome the fact that the Lisbon Declarationcommits Governments to ensuring the participation ofyoung people in programmes that concern them. In thatway we can come closer to democratic civic educationbased on the rights and responsibilities of citizens and onthe participation of young people in civil society.Luxembourg has undertaken a long-term effort tomake its own contribution to providing funds fordevelopment. Our efforts are aimed at attaining the targetset by the United Nations of 0.7 per cent of gross nationalproduct for official development assistance before the endof the millennium. Our efforts occupy an important placein the struggle against poverty  which is one of the mainobstacles to development. At present our contribution is0.56 per cent of gross national product and is equivalentto official development assistance of $195 per capita.According to those criteria  Luxembourg is fifth amongdonor countries in the Development AssistanceCommittee.Fifty years ago our Organization adopted theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. For the first22time  a universal organization declared its determination toplace respect for human rights at the heart of internationalrelations. Since then  we have made considerable progresstowards ensuring recognition for the universal value of suchrights and their effective enjoyment.Several international instruments have been added tothe Universal Declaration so as to focus more precisely onwhat human rights represent and to ensure that the citizensof all countries of the world effectively enjoy these rights.Our Organization has established the post of HighCommissioner for Human Rights  and concern for humanrights now underlies all of its activities. This progress leadsus to believe that human rights will find the central andpermanent home at the heart of international life that theydeserve.We also note that the Criminal Tribunals establishedby the United Nations to bring to trial those accused ofcrimes committed during recent wars in the formerYugoslavia and Rwanda have recently been able tostrengthen their authority and the scope of their action. Thisaffirmation of their importance played a considerable rolein the preparation of the Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court. I sincerely welcome the positive conclusionof the work of the recent Rome Conference. At the sametime  I should like to emphasize the fact that the entireinternational community has given that new institutionstrong and constant support.The end of the culture of impunity represents adecisive turning point in international relations at the end ofthis century. But this turning point will be convincing onlyif the Members of our Organization display a commitmentto provide the new Court with the necessary credibility.In this commemorative year  we must ensure that ourachievements are assessed in depth and that we avoidcomplacency in the field of human rights. Only in this waywill it be possible to expand the base on which we canbuild the values that the international community has sooften said it is prepared to ensure for humankind as awhole.I am confident that the United Nations will remaincapable of steadfastly pursuing the attainment of the greatobjectives it has set itself: to serve men and women  ensurerespect for their rights  preserve them from the scourge ofwar and lead them towards development and fulfilment.Luxembourg?s support will certainly not be lacking."
"103",4308,"LVA",53,1998,"Allow me to congratulate thePresident of the General Assembly on his election and towish him success in discharging his duties. I wish us all aconstructive fifty-third session of the General Assembly.In 1995  the United Nations system commemorated itsgolden anniversary. This year  the United Nations celebratesthe fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. This is a majoraccomplishment for humankind. The Declaration hasinspired the development of a reliable and effectiveinternational system for the protection of human rights.At the time of the adoption of the UniversalDeclaration  Latvia was under Soviet occupation. TheSoviet Union did not respect human rights  even thoughit participated in the preparation and adoption of theDeclaration. I will mention one example among manyviolations of human rights: three and a half months afterthe adoption of the Declaration  the people of Latvia including myself  experienced the largest of severaldeportations. Tens of thousands of people  even elderlypeople and children  were deported to the gulag. This lefta lasting mark on the collective consciousness of thepeople of Latvia and significantly altered the demographicsituation.During the period of occupation  the people ofLatvia were unable to utilize fully the human-rightsprotection system of the United Nations. That situationchanged as Latvia restored its independence. In the sevenyears since Latvia became a Member of the UnitedNations  it has benefitted from the moral and politicalsupport of the largest international organization.Immediately after the restoration of independence our nation had to achieve the removal of a foreignmilitary force. This process was helped by two GeneralAssembly resolutions and the good offices of theSecretary-General. I am pleased to announce that lessthan a month ago the last military installation of theRussian Federation in Latvia â€” the early-warning radarstation in Skrunda â€” was closed. This event illustratesthat international institutions can constructively assist inthe fulfilment of bilateral agreements. Cooperationbetween Latvia and the United Nations has been rich inaccomplishments. The experience gained in the UnitedNations community has helped us in our democraticdevelopment.At present  Latvia is paying particular attention toeconomic and social development. Latvia is experiencinghealthy economic growth at present. Latvia has one of thehighest rates of growth in gross national product and one ofthe lowest rates of inflation among European Unioncandidate States. It has a balanced budget  and expects tohave one next year also. This creates justifiable optimismthat the process of accession to the European Union willcontinue successfully.The development of an integrated society is a nationalpriority. This is a complicated task because the Sovietregime intentionally created a situation in which Latviansalmost became a minority in their own country.Nevertheless  Latvia is dealing resolutely with this task. Bythe end of the year the Government will have completed theelaboration of a programme for the integration of society.This programme will stimulate the development of a civilsociety and provide more opportunities for the learning ofthe Latvian language. When implemented  the programmewill permit all residents of Latvia to participate to an evengreater extent than at present in public and civic life.Already Latvia ensures broad opportunities for thedevelopment of the culture of various ethnic groups and foreducation in their mother tongues.This past June  Latviaâs parliament adopted a far-reaching decision about changes in the citizenship law.Most of the major political forces support these changes inthe citizenship law. Shortly  the people of Latvia will voicetheir opinion of these changes in a referendum.Cooperation with United Nations institutions especially the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  has enhanced the social and economic welfare ofLatviaâs inhabitants. The UNDP has helped our countryresolve sensitive and important issues of integration. Onbehalf of the Government of Latvia  I would like to expressgratitude for the assistance provided by the UNDP inenhancing the welfare of Latviaâs inhabitants. Thesuccessful cooperation should continue.The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights spurs a consideration of Latviaâs possiblecontributions to the human-rights protection system. As afirst-time member of the Commission on Human Rightsbeginning next year  Latvia will support the promotion ofhuman rights as a priority of the United Nations  and theOffice of High Commissioner for Human Rights as theprimary institution for that task. Latvia believes that thepriority role of human rights requires increased funding.Latvia has decided to continue to support financially theproject for the development of national human rightsinstitutions.On the country level  I may note the NationalHuman Rights Office which has operated actively in ourcountry for several years and which is the first institutionof its kind in Central and Eastern Europe. The Office wasestablished with the support of the United Nations. Latviadesires to continue this constructive cooperation with theUnited Nations. In support of the reform packageproposed by the Secretary-General  the Government ofLatvia will establish â€œUnited Nations Houseâ€. By the endof the year a building in Riga will be the home of fiveinstitutions of the United Nations system.It is significant that during the golden anniversary ofthe adoption of the Universal Declaration  the UnitedNations diplomatic conference in Rome adopted adecision to establish an international criminal court.Latvia supports the establishment of an effective courtand hopes that an overwhelming majority of UnitedNations Member States will do likewise.The best protection for human rights is a world inwhich peace and security prevail. The bipolar order  withits characteristic threats to peace and security  is gone.However  the world is still unsafe. International terrorismand crime are growing  access to weapons of massdestruction is growing  ethnic conflicts exist  and threatsto the ecology of our planet are mounting.In order to solve these problems  the enhancedparticipation of the United Nations  including the SecurityCouncil  is essential. To fulfil its role effectively  theSecurity Council must reflect the real balance of theworldâs economic and social power and use skilfully theresources available to it. Latvia reiterates its continuedsupport for an expansion of the Council that would resultin the equitable representation of small States and allregional groups.As I speak from this rostrum  I appreciate the rareopportunity to address the shapers of world politicalopinion. We  the leaders of the United Nations MemberStates  must realize clearly that the highest mission of theUnited Nations is service to humankind. The UnitedNations should become a universal Organization. It will2retain credibility in the eyes of the world only if the resultsof its efforts are clearly evident.A prerequisite for this credibility is the ability tocondemn and deter those who have violated internationallyaccepted norms of behaviour. The United Nations hasshown the ability to do this on many occasions. I believethe time has come for world society to evaluate one of themost inhumane regimes of this century â€” Soviettotalitarianism. I take this opportunity to call uponvictimized peoples to commence a joint effort to evaluateits legacy. The people of Latvia have endured the horrorsof Soviet and Nazi occupations and therefore have the rightto appeal to world society to do everything in its ability toavert the future appearance of similar scourges.We live in an era when the human mind has createdmuch that is useful for promoting mutual respect andunderstanding in our everyday lives. I hope that the resultsof the fifty-third session of the General Assembly will bea lasting investment in shaping the United Nations for thenext millennium."
"104",4355,"MAR",53,1998,"First of all  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session  convinced as I am that under your leadershipand with your vast experience and profound knowledge ofinternational affairs the work of the session will besuccessful. I would also like to take this opportunity tosalute your friendly country of Uruguay.I would also like to express thanks to Mr. HennadiyUdovenko for his successful conduct of the work of ourprevious session. I would like to extend  as well  our deepthanks to Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of ourOrganization  for the earnest determination and greatcompetence he has brought to bear on the matters entrustedto him.This fifty-third session of the General Assembly isbeing held as we bid farewell to the current century andprepare to usher in a new millennium. A large portion ofhumanity is still facing international conditions that do notcome close to enabling them to achieve their ambition andtheir hope to live in a world where peace  internationaljustice  economic development and life in dignity prevail.Despite some signs of economic development incertain third world countries  the general trend points to anincreasing gap between the advanced world and thedeveloping world. The developing world is facing majorchanges over which it has no control  including a heavydebt burden  dwindling prices for raw materials  difficultyin gaining access to markets  financial speculation and lowforeign investments.This situation demands that our Organization notmerely confine itself to preserving international peace andsecurity in the classical sense  but go beyond that and seekto reduce the economic and social burden of developingcountries. This would contribute to the emergence of a newworld order based on consensus  consultation andpartnership among all countries.Since its independence  Morocco has firmly believedin the need to base its economic policy on the principleof free enterprise and external openness as a means ofachieving the country?s economic progress and socialdevelopment.Thus Morocco made an effective contribution to themultilateral trade negotiations that resulted in thefounding of the World Trade Organization in Marrakech.Morocco will also participate  with the same degreeof resolution  in the forthcoming negotiations with otherMember States to ensure that the international communityachieves equitable distribution of the dividends of theinternational trade system  without overlooking the needfor proper coordination of monetary  financial and tradepolicies  lest the financial crisis currently affecting certaininternational markets have adverse effects on theeconomies of other countries.One of the world?s primary political trouble spots indeed one of the most complex problems threateningworld peace and security  is the problem of the MiddleEast. The many resolutions of the United Nations aimedat finding a solution to this problem have failed to enablethe Palestinian people to enjoy their inalienable andlegitimate rights or to compel Israel to withdraw from thePalestinian territories  including Jerusalem — Al-Quds —and the other occupied territories in the Golan Heightsand southern Lebanon. Those resolutions met only withIsraeli rejection and defiance.In this respect  the reneging by the current IsraeliGovernment on the implementation of the agreementssigned as part of the peace process following the Madridconference and the Oslo meetings dashed the hopes thathad been pinned on those agreements and again plungedthe region into a spiral of despair and instability.Israel?s reneging is quite obvious in its currentprocrastination tactics as well as its attempts to impose apolicy of fait accompli through the building of furthersettlements in the occupied territories  in violation of allinternational norms and laws. Recently  Israel furthercompounded the situation by implementing  in aprovocative way  a policy for the Judaization ofJerusalem — Al-Quds — by changing its cultural anddemographic characteristics and surrounding it withsettlement colonies. The latest such measure was theannouncement by the Israeli Government last June of theexpansion of the municipal boundaries of Al-Quds  aspart of what is known as “Greater Jerusalem”.32The entire Islamic world  as it denounces andcondemns these practices  which affect the status ofAl-Quds as an integral part of the Palestinian territoriesoccupied in 1967  considers all these Israeli practices asnull and void. This was indeed confirmed by the meetingof the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of theIslamic Conference  under the chairmanship of His MajestyKing Hassan II  in Casablanca at the end of July.Morocco believes that this problem can be solved onlythrough respect for the letter and spirit of the agreementssigned and through the implementation of the resolutions ofinternational legitimacy  especially the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions  in a way that will guarantee the rightof the Palestinian people to self-determination and to theestablishment of their independent state  with Al-Quds as itscapital  and the return of the occupied Arab territories totheir legitimate owners.Despite the tremendous potential and enormousresources available in Africa  and despite the fact that mostAfrican countries carry out appropriate economic policies the African continent is still suffering from serious political economic and social crises which have led to themarginalization of our continent and the shrinkage of itsrole in the international arena.Some of these crises are clearly reflected in worseningunemployment  increased debt burden  falling prices forcommodities exported by African countries  inadequateforeign investment and declining foreign assistance  whichstands at barely 0.22 per cent of the gross national productof developed countries  despite the fact that the amountagreed upon is 0.7 per cent.It is indeed regrettable that the deterioration of theeconomic situation has contributed to a resurgence ofpolitical instability and military confrontations in certainAfrican regions  as is the case at present in the Great Lakesregion  the Horn of Africa and Western Africa.While expressing concern about this situation Morocco supports efforts aimed at containing these crisesand at guaranteeing the countries of those regions especially the Democratic Republic of the Congo  theirterritorial integrity  stability and security. In this respect Morocco commends the efforts made by the Statesmembers of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) to find a solution to the crises in Liberiaand Sierra Leone. We hope that the efforts being made toovercome the crisis in Guinea-Bissau will soon besuccessful.In order to find a solution to African economicproblems and their political repercussions  we would liketo reaffirm the proposal made by His Majesty KingHassan II during the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) meeting in Marrakesh for adopting aninternational plan similar to the Marshall Plan  with aview to ensuring African economic revival.We would like to thank the Secretary-General of ourOrganization for the important report he prepared onAfrica at the request of the Security Council. We hopethat the international community will seek to giveconcrete substance to its recommendations through thesettlement of conflicts and the strengthening of securityand stability in our continent so as to contribute to thenecessary conditions for its economic and socialdevelopment.Morocco has consistently affirmed that itsmembership in the Arab Maghreb Union is a free andstrategic option which is irreversible  dictated by itshistoric and civilizational roots  as well as by its currentand future interests. Given the existence of thismembership  Morocco cannot but express its deepconcern over the continuing suffering of the brotherlyLibyan people as a result of the air embargo imposed onthem  which caused them a great deal of hardship.We welcome the approval by the United States andthe United Kingdom of the Libyan proposal  which wassupported by the League of Arab States  the Organizationof the Islamic Conference and the Non-AlignedMovement  to try the two Libyan suspects in a neutralcountry.On the other hand  we deeply regret the suffering ofanother Arab people — the Iraqi people — as a result ofthe pernicious effects of the economic embargo imposedon that country. We hope that the agreement reachedbetween the Iraqi Government and the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  will lead to a resumption of cooperationbetween Iraq and the United Nations so that the embargocan be lifted and the hardships of this brotherly peoplecan be ended. We also hope that the Secretary-Generalwill succeed in finding a definitive solution to thisprotracted crisis.As a Mediterranean State geographically located nearEuropean States  Morocco has been taking a specialinterest  as always  in efforts to consolidate Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. However  Morocco cannot butbe concerned about the continuing status of the Moroccan33cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the neighbouring islands which are still under Spanish occupation  at a time whenthe page of colonialism in most parts of the world has beenturned.His Majesty King Hassan II proposed some time agothe setting up of a Moroccan-Spanish panel to consider andfind a solution to this abnormal situation  in a way thatwould guarantee Morocco?s sovereignty over its territorywhile taking into account the economic interests of Spain.Although the Spanish authorities have not yet reactedto this fair proposal  Morocco remains convinced that thedepth of its historical and economic ties with neighbouringSpain  coupled with the aspirations of the two peoples toachieve greater rapprochement  cooperation andparticipation in many fields  will be sufficient to enable thetwo countries to reach a formula for a definitive solution tothis problem.With regard to developments in the referendumprocess in our southern provinces — the area known asWestern Sahara — we can only point out that it is stillexperiencing some difficulties. The identification processwas stalled from the outset because the other party  withoutjustification  refused to take part in the identification of alarge number of candidates. Yet these candidates fulfilledthe agreed criteria and had been registered by the UnitedNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.Once again we are now faced with the refusal of the otherparty to participate in the identification of these candidates who this time presented themselves in accordance with theHouston agreements that the other party had  indeed  alsoaccepted.Those agreements confirmed the right of candidates tobe identified and reasserted the validity of oral testimony.Indeed  in accordance with those agreements  the twoparties had agreed to begin  as soon as possible  theidentification of any individual who may present himself orherself for that purpose.We can only express deep concern over thesedevelopments  which will delay the referendum operationwhich has been long awaited by Morocco and the Saharanrefugee brothers who have been yearning for more than 20years to return to their homeland  Morocco  in order toparticipate in their region?s ongoing development. This willprobably also have repercussions on the building of thegreater Maghreb to which the peoples of the region aspire.The relentless determination to exclude a number ofSaharans from participation in the referendum casts stillmore doubts on the will of the other party to ensure thenecessary conditions for the organization of a fair andtransparent referendum.We hope that the tremendous progress the world iscurrently witnessing will be a factor leading to theemergence of solidarity among all peoples  solidarity thatwill contribute to ensuring greater advancement towardsdevelopment  security  peace and the spread of tranquillityand prosperity among all peoples of the world."
"105",4379,"MCO",53,1998,"The principality of Monaco is particularlypleased that you  Mr. President  are carrying out the highfunctions and responsibilities of this fifty-third session ofour General Assembly. Your election by acclamationbears witness to the confidence that the internationalcommunity has placed in your personal qualities and inyour experience. It is also a manifestation of the respectthat Member States have for your country  Uruguay.I would also like to include the newly electedmembers of the Bureau in my cordial congratulations toyou and in the wishes for success that I extend to you.It is also a pleasant duty for me to pay a mostearnest and sincere tribute to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko who presided with such great talent and effectiveness overthe fifty-second of the Assembly.Geography often dictates the fate of a nation. Thisis particularly true for the Principality of Monaco  whoselife and development for centuries have depended on thesea. So it is that my country has always attached greatimportance to all issues concerning the sea. In fact  wehost several institutions devoted to the marineenvironment.In this International Year of the Ocean  it seemsfitting to recall that the Principality is also celebrating theone hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Prince10Albert I of Monaco  one of the founders of oceanography to whom our country owes a great deal of its renown.My illustrious forebear  born in 1848  devoted asubstantial part of his life to the scientific study of theoceans. An accomplished and passionate seaman  he was apioneer during 30 years of scientific study that led himfrom the Azores to Spitzberg.Prince Albert I created in Monaco in 1910 theOceanographic Museum in order to share what he hadlearned from his maritime expeditions and to reveal thebeauty and wealth of the marine environment. Previously in Paris in 1906  he had founded the OceanographicInstitute  which  in the same spirit  he devoted to teachingand research.He was also a forerunner of oceanology  in that someof his work or his insights led to major medical discoveries such as anaphylaxis and antibacterial action. By advancingresearch on what he called the meteorology of the upperatmosphere of the oceans  he paved the way for studies ofoceanic atmospheric exchanges and their impact on climate.Following his example  we should encourageclimatological studies in order to prevent as much aspossible such tragic flooding as that which — victimizingtoo many people — rages today in Bangladesh  in Chinaand in the Chiapas region in Mexico. This is not tooverlook  of course  hurricane Georges  which is nowstriking the Caribbean islands with such force.In responding to the wishes of the Ninth InternationalOceanographic Congress  on 30 March 1910 Prince AlbertI brought together a special commission to propose aprogramme for the scientific exploration of theMediterranean. Because of the First World War  the generalconstitutive conference could not be held until 1919  inMadrid. In the presence of representatives of eight Stateswith coasts on the Mediterranean  the programme andworking methods of the international commission for thescientific exploration of the Mediterranean were established.The comprehensive activities of this institution  unique innature and mission  continue today. The institution bringstogether very high-level political leaders and scientists. LastJune in Croatia it held its thirty-fifth meeting. PrinceRainier III  my father  who is now the Chairman  took thatopportunity to again express his confidence in the scientificcommunity  encouraging it not to underestimate theinfluence it might have on political decisions  especially inthe area of maritime affairs.It is in this spirit that we attach special interest tothe work conducted by the Independent WorldCommission on Oceans  under the leadership of theformer President of Portugal  Mario Soares. We hope thatits conclusions  which are essential for the lastingconservation of our marine heritage  will receive all theattention they deserve.Inspired by the scientific work of Prince Albert I Prince Rainier III  my father  and his Government have inrecent years continued and strengthened his visionarypolicy. Two examples are the scientific centre establishedin 1960 and the RAMOGE agreement signed with Franceand Italy so as to prevent all types of pollution — whichare numerous in the Ligurian Sea.Furthermore  since last 27 March the Principality hashad a law that brings together in one legislative body allprovisions relating to the law of the sea  conforming themto the legal and technical requirements of thecontemporary maritime world — first and foremost to theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea andother relevant international instruments to which Monacois a party.We are also very much involved in activities carriedout by the International Whaling Commission. Our effortsrecently led to the establishment of 40 degrees south asthe boundary of the new southern sanctuary designed toensure protection for the feeding and reproductiongrounds of 90 per cent of large whales. The Governmentsaffected by this decision have committed themselves tolimit the number of so-called scientific hunting permits inorder to protect effectively this sanctuary.I would like  furthermore  to draw the attention ofthe General Assembly to fresh threats to the marineenvironment posed by new synthetic chemical products such as dioxins and certain pesticides which affect theneurological and brain development of many species.Large amounts of these products are now found in theflesh of fish and other marine vertebrates in the northernhemisphere  presenting an imminent threat not only to thebalance of marine biodiversity but also to the health ofthe human race. I am thinking in particular of the Belugawhales  now among the most poisoned animals on ourplanet.11The substantial contribution of Prince Albert I toprogress in oceanography should not allow us to forget hisresearch in other areas  such as the study of prehistory.Thanks to discoveries made in coastal caves  it has enabledus to identify one of the links in human evolution  whichhas helped to establish scientifically the common origin ofthe human race. These fossils  along with otherarchaeological objects found in the caves of the region  arepreserved in the Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology which the Prince created in 1902 in Monaco. Just as he hadestablished the Oceanographic Institute in Paris to promotemarine sciences  Prince Albert I gave the French capital anInstitute of Human Paleontology  where since 1910 courseshave been given and interdisciplinary research has beenconducted on geology  prehistoric paleontology andethnography.Like many scholars  Prince Albert I did not limit hisactivities to research. He felt the profound need forcommunication  teaching and propagation of knowledge. Hegave talks in Italy  Belgium  Spain and Austria. Heinaugurated congresses in Paris  Bordeaux and Washington.One could also see him in the outskirts of the Frenchcapital giving night classes to workers enrolled in thePeople?s University of Paris. Prince Albert I probablyanticipated the immense enthusiasm with which at thebeginning of the 1960s men and women of all disciplinesand a large part of the peoples of the world were to cometogether in favour of ecology — that is  respect for nature its balance and the interdependence of the beings that livein it. Since the beginning of the century he had perceivedsome of the bases for an environmentalism which was bothpopular and scientific and which he himself tried to put intopractice.So it is that his temple of the sea  the OceanographicInstitute Museum of Monaco  was  on his initiative surrounded by superb gardens containing original andvaried Mediterranean species. Also very interested inbotany  he established on the rocky  arid coast of Monacoan exotic garden open to the public where we findsucculent plants  some very rare and endangered  preservedwith great care. My ancestor was to some extent aforerunner of those involved in the defence of biodiversity.A profound believer in justice and an ardent defenderof universal friendship  Prince Albert I in 1903 also createdin Monaco the International Institute for Peace  where hebrought together jurists  economists  philosophers andscientists to whom he assigned the mission of considering“ways of solving disputes between nations  propagatingdedication to methods for bringing about harmoniousunderstanding  and eradicating hatred from the hearts ofpeoples”. Forty-two years later these words echoed in thepreamble to the United Nations Charter adopted in SanFrancisco.The Academy for Peace and International Security which meets regularly in Monaco  perpetuates  on theinitiative of my father  the reigning Prince  thedetermination of Prince Albert I to promote research onpeace and the causes of conflict as well as the study ofwar. Its thirtieth session  which I was pleased to open on19 March  devoted its work to globalization andinternational security. The discussions were led by high-ranking personalities from the worlds of diplomacy defence and business  as well as by representatives ofmajor international organizations. Its recommendationsand conclusions essentially deal with the risks of tensionand conflict inherent in the globalization of the economyand the best ways to overcome these risks.The interest in humankind expressed in his researchon primitive man and his environment  his commitmentto scientific knowledge and its spread  his rejection ofviolence and his tireless fight for peace and respect fornature are all very contemporary messages which PrinceAlbert I bequeathed to us. This was the meeting of ahuman life with history  and his multidimensional legacyhas come to us through time. He has influenced the mindsof the people of Monaco  generation upon generation  inmaking us a welcoming  peace-loving people  respectfulof our environment. Enriched by and adapted to worlddevelopments and progress by his successors  primarilymy father  this heritage is now at the core of essentialmissions which we have entrusted to the United Nations.My country  within its modest means  is more preparedthan ever to make its experience  inherited from itsdifficult past  available for understanding andrapprochement.The defence of human rights and respect for humandignity  which are inscribed in letters of gold in theUnited Nations Charter  were no doubt of inspiration toPrince Albert I when he personally committed himself tothe rehabilitation of Captain Dreyfus and when he decidedto grant constitutional political rights to his subjects in1911.These fundamental human rights are beingcommemorated by the international community today.This is a great event. Fifty years ago  on 10 December1948  our General Assembly at its third session  held inParis at the Palais de Chaillot  adopted the Universal12Declaration of Human Rights. One of those primarilyresponsible for it  the French professor René Cassin received in 1968  20 years after the solemn proclamation the Nobel Peace Prize. This commemoration should be anopportunity for collective soul-searching. To what extentare human rights enjoyed internationally? Above all  whatis the position with regard to the initiatives taken to realizethe right to development  which was officially recognizedin 1993 by the international community at the WorldConference on Human Rights  held in Vienna?The current fierce economic competition which isaggravating macroeconomic imbalances is not without animpact on the enjoyment of human rights. While respect forcivil and political rights seems to be less affected economic  social and cultural rights underpinning the rightto development have made only modest progress — wherethey have not  indeed  met with major setbacks.The current financial crisis is depriving millions ofmen and women of their basic rights  when not actuallydestroying their lives. At the world level  it has led to anoverall drop in life expectancy  an increase in infant andmaternal mortality  greater unemployment  growinginsecurity  uncontrolled migration and a grave deteriorationin social welfare  accompanied by a relentless drop inincome among the active population. The high-leveldialogue on the theme of the social and economic impact ofglobalization and interdependence and their policyimplications  which was held in this Hall on 17 and 18September  clearly stressed these facts.Human rights are indissoluble. They must be enjoyedby everyone everywhere. As the General Assemblyproclaimed on 10 December 1948  they are a commonstandard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. Thehighest authorities of my country  along with the entireMonegasque people  are thoroughly convinced of this.One thought comes to mind. It may be a lengthy one since the question is delicate and quite complex. TheGovernment of the Principality is perfectly well aware thaturgent and concrete steps must be encouraged at thenational and global levels. Mrs. Mary Robinson  the HighCommissioner for Human Rights  has our full support andall our confidence. We know how difficult her task is andhow pitiful are her resources in the face of reality.The Principality of Monaco also attaches the highestimportance to the tireless and courageous work of theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees  which  I am pleased to recall  received the NobelPeace Prize nearly 45 years ago in 1954. Mrs. SadakoOgata and her colleagues deserve our support and respect.The United Nations humanitarian activities  whichare necessary today as never before  and its efforts toeliminate anti-personnel landmines and the human tragedythey entail also deserve our greatest encouragement.I wish here to emphasize the special interest whichmy father  the Sovereign Prince  and I  President of theRed Cross of Monaco — currently celebrating its fiftiethanniversary — attach to respect for and strictimplementation of the Geneva Convention relative to theProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of 12August 1949. Despite the tireless efforts of theInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red CrescentSocieties  as well as of many humanitarian organizationsthat I wish to commend here for the altruism and courageof their members  we note an increase in seriousviolations of this text  as well as of the most basic humanrights of the most vulnerable sectors of the population including children.Last June  the Security Council rightly expressed itsgrave concern at the terrible consequences to children ofarmed conflict. It energetically and unequivocallycondemned the abuses to which they are subject especially the humiliations  outrages  sexual violence kidnapping and displacements  as well their recruitmentand use in combat  in violation of current internationallaw. The authorities of Monaco unreservedly share thatposition and are prepared to lend active support  to theextent of their abilities  to the Secretary-General?s SpecialRepresentative for Children in Armed Conflict so that hemay fulfil his noble mission.Unfortunately  the fate of children may be equallytragic outside armed conflict. Following the WorldCongress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation ofChildren  held in Stockholm in August 1996  theGovernment of Monaco  as I stated to the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session  has striven to reform itscriminal legislation in order to bring it into line with itscommitments. In implementation of article 34 of theConvention on the Rights of the Child  to which Monacois Party  new legislative provisions have been enacted with broader scope to criminalize to the greatest possibleextent the sexual exploitation of children to satisfy thevices of others.The establishment  last July in Rome  of anInternational Criminal Court is a source of great hope.13This represents major progress  a far-reaching change in theinternational order that fosters respect for the essentialprinciples of humanitarian law. Its Statute  adopted by alarge majority  opens the way to the prosecution of warcrimes and the most heinous crimes against humanity  manyof which affect children  of course  but also woman and thedefenceless elderly. The Principality of Monaco  whichparticipated in the Diplomatic Conference in Rome welcomes this historic decision.The Royal Government is grateful that such weightyissues as the definition of crimes  the principle ofcomplementarity  jurisdictions  the independence of theprosecutor?s office and relations with United Nations organswere all solved satisfactorily.I also wish to express on behalf of my country ourgreat satisfaction at the work which the Secretary-Generalhas done in recent months. The reports he submits to usnote progress in many areas  including administrative andfinancial management and the restructuring of theSecretariat. Outstanding progress has been achieved thanksto the trusting and close cooperation he has established withrepresentatives of Member States and with officials of themost influential international world and regional bodies.His diplomatic initiatives  carried out with greatwisdom  patience and determination  have often beencrowned with success  despite the obstacles and difficultieshe has encountered. We are especially pleased that  in comecases  his initiatives have allowed us to prevent or stabilizeconflicts that might otherwise have been extremelydevastating.The Secretary-General?s well-written and incisivereport on the causes of conflict and the promotion ofdurable peace and sustainable development in Africa hasriveted our attention. It is a valuable source of inspirationand ideas for bringing peace to Africa.In this respect  I cannot fail to recall that we arecommemorating this year the fiftieth anniversary ofpeacekeeping operations. It was in 1948 that the firstUnited Nations observer mission was established. I take thisopportunity to pay a tribute to all those men and womenwho have served under the United Nations flag and tosalute the memory of those who gave their lives in the lineof duty. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld was amongthem. More recently  in Kabul  an Italian LieutenantColonel was killed and a French military adviser wounded.The Convention on the Safety of United Nations andAssociated Personnel  adopted by the General Assembly atits forty-ninth session  is more relevant than ever. Tenyears ago  on 10 December 1988  United NationsPeacekeeping Forces received the Nobel Peace Prize. AsI see it  this high distinction should be recalled on theoccasion of this anniversary.I would like to express great sadness felt in mycountry over the accident of Swissair flight 111. Mysaddest thoughts go to the victims of that accident  someof whom belonged to the great United Nations family. Weshare the grief of their loved ones.Africa and Europe have recently experienced a tragicseries of terrorist attacks that have taken a toll ofhundreds of victims including women  children elderly people  many of whom were present merely bychance. Those attacks have given rise to an inevitableescalation of the use of force and an increased risk ofconflict. The authorities and people of Monaco have feltthese painful events very deeply. Through me  they wishto reaffirm to the Governments concerned and to thefamilies of the victims their solidarity and their deepestsympathy.On 13 August 1995  the Security Council firmlycondemned acts of terrorism  which they called anoutrage. It recalled its statement of 31 January 1992 issued at its high-level meeting of heads of State andGovernment. The Principality of Monaco agrees fullywith that position. It is perfectly aware that terrorismendangers not only the security of States and theircitizens  but also international cooperation and peace. Mycountry is more convinced than ever of the need tostrengthen international cooperation  with a view tocombating more effectively this scourge  which is aserious and tragic setback in relations among humanbeings  nations and peoples. It fully endorses theprovisions of General Assembly resolution 52/165 adopted on 15 December 1997  and its provisions aimedat the elimination of international terrorism.Our Government is now considering the possibilityof adhering to the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings  which was adoptedlast year without a vote and which is currently open forsignature. Furthermore  we hope that negotiations underway on a draft convention on the suppression of acts ofnuclear terrorism will be concluded quickly.In conclusion  it is my hope that the work of thisfifty-third session of the General Assembly will becrowned with success and that the activities of the14Organization will be strengthened in such vital areas asinternational security  disarmament  sustainable developmentand the protection of the environment."

From this loftyrostrum I should like to underline the importance theRepublic of Moldova attaches to the role of the UnitedNations in the world.In the new world structure  the United Nations is  forthe Republic of Moldova  as it is for other States  the bodythat allows them to express their national identity and theirown points of view in a framework with the largestpossible audience and resonance. This is why my countrytakes an active part in debates on issues of importance tothe international community  pertaining to the maintenanceof peace and international security  to social and economicdevelopment  to the expansion of international and regionalcooperation  to fighting terrorism and to increasing therole and effectiveness of the United Nations.The far-reaching changes in international life at theend of this century have left their imprint on the activitiesof the United Nations. That is why we must strengthenand further improve the United Nations system so as torenew and adapt the Organization to the increaseddemands of international cooperation. Today  more thana year after the new initiatives were launched by theSecretary-General  we observe that his proposals recommendations and specific measures for reforming theUnited Nations correspond to a large extent to thesedemands.My delegation welcomes the progress achieved inthe reform process of the United Nations  particularly inthe economic and social spheres  and supports themeasures to streamline and make more efficient theactivities of the Organization. We believe that themerging of some structures  as well as decentralizationand the transfer of authority to field offices will make anessential contribution to adapting the United Nations tonew requirements. We believe that the debates during thissession on proposals and measures for the restructuring ofthe entire United Nations system will have an impact onother areas of the Organization?s activities.The increase in the number of Security Councilmembers is the crux of the overall reform of the UnitedNations. Since  thus far  we have not found generallyacceptable solutions pertaining to the various aspects ofthe issue of reforming the Security Council  we believethat during this session Member States should show thesame spirit of compromise as that shown by the WorkingGroup on the Security Council question.While taking into account the need to ensure betterrepresentation of Member States in the Security Council the Republic of Moldova  as at previous sessions continues to be in favour of a moderate expansion in thenumber of Council members. New permanent seats shouldbe granted to developed countries such as Germany andJapan  as the Republic of Moldova has advocated atseveral previous sessions of the General Assembly  andpossibly to developing countries as well.Regarding the number of non-permanent seats  theRepublic of Moldova is in favour of a reasonable increasein accordance with the principle of equitable geographicalrepresentation so as to reflect the interests of all regionalgroups. To our mind  an increase in the number of the4members of the Security Council in that category shouldtake into account the legitimate interest of States of Centraland Eastern Europe in having an additional  non-permanentseat since in recent years the number of States in thatregion has doubled.Changes that have taken place in recent years in Stateswith transitional economies  including the Republic ofMoldova  have shown that political and economic changesinvolve risks and difficulties that affect several areas ofsociety. Major problems  such as a decline in production are too complex to be solved only with one?s ownresources.In such circumstances  the role of the United Nationssystem in the economic and social spheres takes on a newdimension. The United Nations must remain the frameworkfor international cooperation for all nations. This  in fact  isan absolute necessity in the current situation  in whichfinancial crises have affected the economies of severalcountries  thereby jeopardizing their political and economicreforms.Committed to the path of democracy  the Republic ofMoldova is steadily striving to create basic institutions forthe rule of law and the legislative framework necessary fortransition to a market economy. As a result  we have beenable to stabilize the macroeconomic situation and havereduced the annual inflation rate to 12 per cent.My country takes an active part in internationalcooperation within the framework of the Black SeaEconomic Cooperation  the South-East EuropeanCooperative Initiative  the Central European Initiative andthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.Similarly  the signing of the Partnership and CooperationAgreement with the European Union has considerablydiversified economic relations for the Republic of Moldova.My country also attaches crucial importance to itsforthcoming adherence to the World Trade Organization.Like other Member States  including those witheconomies in transition  the Republic of Moldova has takenpart in United Nations projects in the economic and socialsphere and is benefiting from the assistance and support ofthe United Nations to promote economic reform. This iswhy we greatly appreciate the activities of the UnitedNations Development Programme.The economic decline in Asia has engendered a worldeconomic crisis with devastating consequences. As theSecretary-General has said  the world economic crisis hasbeen felt in Russia  in North America and in Europe.Today  major economies are increasingly feeling theimpact of events taking place in less developed areas ofthe world.In the process of the globalization of the worldeconomy  the United Nations could serve as acoordinating centre for creating an international financialstructure.Managing the crisis and the effects of globalizationalso has particular importance for countries witheconomies in transition. Those States find themselves atthe stage of moving towards a market economy  whichrequires the achievement of a whole set of objectives such as macroeconomic stabilization  reform of price-setting mechanisms  restructuring of the major sectors ofthe economy  reduction of inflation  creation of new jobsand  last but not least  integration into the world economy.Finally  it is important in our view that  in seekingsolutions to the problems facing States with economies intransition  we should take into account first and foremostthe specific characteristics of each country. We must takeinto consideration the fact that economic recovery in thiscategory of countries is a complex problem because of theparticularities of each State.We hope that the United Nations will enhance itspresence in States with economies in transition throughregional economic commissions  as well as through fundsand specialized agencies. We also deem it useful in thisregard to consider the question of the integration of theeconomies of countries in transition into the worldeconomy.In the context of the debate on reform in theeconomic sphere  I wish to note that my country supportsdecisions adopted by the General Assembly and by theEconomic and Social Council regarding an increase indevelopment assistance and effective coordination ofactivities of the regional commissions with other bodiesof the United Nations system.The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights is yet anotherreason to intensify efforts to promote and protect humanrights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world.The Republic of Moldova greatly appreciates UnitedNations human rights activities and supports the reformmeasures that have been adopted  in particular those5pertaining to strengthening the role of the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.My country attaches special importance to thepromotion and protection of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms. The Republic of Moldova has acceded to themajor international legal instruments on human rightsadopted within the framework of the United Nations  theCouncil of Europe and the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE). Our Parliament has ratifieda series of international conventions such as theInternational Covenants on Economic  Social and CulturalRights and on Civil and Political Rights. The Parliament ofthe Republic of Moldova has adopted more than 20 lawsdealing expressly with human rights. Respect for andprotection of human rights in my country are alsosafeguarded by the Constitutional Court  which has the finalsay on the Constitution  by the principle of the separationof powers  and by the responsibility of the State towards itscitizens.The major events of the past decade have had aconsiderable impact on the situation in various parts of theworld. Sometimes these events have been complicated bysocial tension and by serious violations of human rights and have even given rise to armed conflicts.It is known that the conflict in the eastern part of theRepublic of Moldova in the summer of 1992 was caused bythe dismantling of the USSR and that it was supported byforces wishing to preserve the old political system.Unfortunately  we were unable to avoid that tragic situation.Even though the conflict has ceased  its consequencesremain. There has been no final settlement of the conflict and to some extent this is an obstacle to the process of thedemocratization of society and to the promotion ofdemocratic reforms. Serious human rights violationscontinue in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova.Members of the Ilascu group have not yet been released; inthe meantime  Prisoner Ilascu has actually been elected asa Deputy in the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova.The efforts of the Republic of Moldova to settle thisconflict peacefully  and my country?s readiness to grant thatregion special status with broad authority  on the conditionthat it respects the territorial integrity and sovereignty of theRepublic of Moldova  are well known.But I have to recall that we are still facing difficultiesin the negotiating process that took place with thecooperation of the OSCE and representatives of the RussianFederation and of Ukraine as mediators. The irreconcilableposition of the separatist leaders has blocked the fullimplementation of agreements signed with the help of themediators  which were intended to be interim documentsthat could help renew negotiations and increase trustamong the parties. The situation is further aggravated bythe presence in the region of vast quantities of weaponsand ammunition and vast numbers of foreign troops.However  on 21 October 1994 the Republic ofMoldova and the Russian Federation signed an agreementon the withdrawal of armaments and military personnel.Unfortunately the Russians have yet to ratify thatagreement. Implementation of the agreement would be inline with the letter and the spirit of the Constitution of theRepublic of Moldova  which stipulates the neutrality ofour State and bans the deployment of foreign troops onour territory.We believe that the immediate withdrawal of thesevast quantities of weapons and ammunition wouldconsiderably strengthen stability in the region whilefacilitating the process of settling the crisis. In thatcontext  we hope that the OSCE mission in the Republicof Moldova and the mediator States  the RussianFederation and Ukraine  will intensify their efforts tobring about the resumption of negotiations in conformitywith the principle of respect for the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic ofMoldova  and that they will contribute to the withdrawalof the weapons  ammunition and troops. This woulddefuse the conflict and would create conditions propitiousfor its final settlement. Finally  I state solemnly that theRepublic of Moldova remains open to dialogue and willcontinue to try to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.We hope that common sense will prevail.The problems facing humankind as we come to theend of this century are many and complex. Although thethreat of another world war has been diminished humanity must face a multitude of conflicts and tensionsthat jeopardize peace and stability in many parts of theworld.I believe that we must make use of all ourexperience  and focus all our efforts to resolve currentcrises and to prevent conflicts. In my view  we can facetoday?s challenges and ensure world peace and securityonly through joint action by the international community.At this stage of ongoing globalization  the United Nations with its universal mission  remains the principal forum inwhich to find solutions to crucial issues. My country isready to cooperate with all other Member States to6strengthen the Organization?s capacity better to meet thechallenges of the coming millennium."
"107",4448,"MDG",53,1998,"The General Assembly hasunanimously chosen Mr. Opertti to direct the work of itsfifty-third session. Echoing previous speakers  I shouldlike to congratulate him  as I consider his election atribute to his personal qualities as a diplomat and astatesman. Through me  Madagascar is pleased to expressits best wishes for the success of his mission.His predecessor  whose competence we valued  wasable to rely on our cooperation throughout his term ofoffice; and Mr. Opertti may also be assured of ourcomplete support in his efforts to accomplish his tasksuccessfully.Madagascar reiterates its encouragement and supportto the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  in his quest forways and means to make our Organization increasinglydynamic.The great family of the United Nations is meetingonce again  as it does every year  to reflect collectively onthe situation in the world so as to lay the foundations for19a better existence  one which is safer and more equitable in spite of all our differences and divergences.Madagascar reaffirms its support for the UnitedNations though its presence every year at this annualgathering. For us  this forum for exchanging viewsrepresents the first  universal bastion against injustice andviolence in the world  and it is the best tool forsafeguarding peace and security and for the promotion ofprogress.In the light of the statements made here  globalizationundoubtedly constitutes the backdrop for our many concernsat this end of the century. With all its advantages disadvantages and disappointments  and transcending thelimits of the economic framework  globalization is todayexpressing itself in terms of insecurity.Insecurity is spreading virtually everywhere  in manyforms and manifestations. Insecurity is being globalized and whenever a man dies — whether it be in a war  or asa bombing victim  or in a cold-blooded massacre  or simplyin his sickbed — somewhere children cry  women suffer bythe hundreds  by the thousands  by the millions. And deathis more than ever part of our daily lives. This is why todaywe are focusing our attention on the problems of insecurityand on the need to rally our efforts for the maintenance ofpeace.The international community is now confrontingsituations that jeopardize peace and security and thatthreaten the sustainable development of nations. In manyparts of the world  civil wars  inter-State conflicts  borderdisputes  and ethnic  tribal and religious confrontationsresurface  bringing suffering  poverty  political instabilityand marginalization  be it in Kosovo  the Comoros  theGreat Lakes region or elsewhere.Added to this is the persistence of new threats  suchas international terrorism  organized crime  corruption  theproliferation of narcotic drugs and the deterioration of theenvironment. Access to weapons of mass destruction isbecoming easier and easier. The proliferation of the light-weapons industry and the widespread use of those weaponsare becoming a major scourge for most countries.Insecurity is economic as well as social. In the era oftechnological progress and of the spectacular growth inworld food production  whole regions are experiencingfamine and malnutrition. One quarter of the world’spopulation is still living in poverty. Millions of childrenunder the age of five continue to die of diseases  and majorsectors of society are cut off from education and frombasic health care. About 180 million children under theage of 14 are obliged to work; the less fortunate have noalternative except sexual exploitation  and for many youngpeople unemployment is the only prospect for the future.Similarly  a large number of women cannot to this veryday exercise their fundamental rights. Many remainvictims of domestic violence  social injustice  deliberatemassacres or armed conflict.Moreover  the financial upheaval that has afflictedSouth-East Asia  Latin America and Russia has shakenthe international economic system. It is true that globalinformation networks have reduced both distances andtime  but at the same time they have contributed toincreasing scientific  cultural and moral insecurity.Computer viruses have become as dangerous as nuclear biological and chemical weapons. All of this illustratesthe magnitude and the drawbacks of globalization  as wellas the scope of the interdependence of States.Fifty years after the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  the rights and freedoms inherent in the dignity andworth of the human person are still often violated  and wewitness the burgeoning of new challenges — challengesthat are ever different and that require well-adapted andbetter-planned strategies. It is obvious that no State in theworld can guarantee each of its citizens material andspiritual well-being in conditions of peace and full respectfor the most basic rights and freedoms.While in the recent past — and more specifically in1985  from this same rostrum — emphasis was placed onthe balance of forces  in general  and on nuclear parity  inparticular  everyone today unanimously recognizes thatsecurity cannot exist without cooperation and solidarity which implies spectacular changes in internationalrelations. Evidence of this recognition is the forthcomingentry into force  on 1 March 1999  of the internationalConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction  as well as the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones.For its part  Madagascar  which has never deviatedfrom its commitment to disarmament and which is  in thisrespect  a signatory of a number of internationalConventions  is gratified at the prospects of thenegotiation of a cut-off treaty on fissile material formilitary purposes in the framework of the Conference onDisarmament in Geneva.20We also welcome the call for the holding in the nearfuture of an international conference on the completeelimination of nuclear weapons  a call made by the headsof State or Government of the Movement of Non-AlignedCountries who met recently in Durban. Along the samelines  Madagascar of course associates itself with theproposal made by President Blaise Compaoré  the currentChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) concerning the convening in the year 2000 of a summitconference under the auspices of the United Nations witha view to the formulation by the international communityof a joint response to the problem of terrorism.Like other States  on 18 July  in Rome  Madagascarsigned the Statute of the International Criminal Court  aswell as the Final Act of the Diplomatic Conference ofPlenipotentiaries.It would be appropriate to consider the question ofsecurity through a multidimensional approach encompassingmilitary  economic and social aspects at various levels —international  regional and national.Poverty and the persistence of imbalances that dividethe world into developed countries  developing countries least developed countries  poor and indebted countries  arefactors contributing to tension and obstacles to theestablishment of a genuine and lasting peace. This  in anyevent  is the reality in Africa  my continent.The Cairo Declaration of 1993 established the primaryobjective of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution in Africa. Nonetheless  withoutthe active support of the international community  theseactions would remain ineffective. Security Councilresolution 1170 (1998)  on the holding of regular ministerialmeetings in order to evaluate actions undertaken for peacein Africa  should therefore be welcomed. For Madagascar it is a question of confirming the will to coordinate actionsof the United Nations with the pan-African organization andwith regional mechanisms.While awaiting an appropriate mobilization of theresources needed for the effective implementation of actionsin the framework of the Agenda for Development  it seemsto us vital that the developing countries make theircontribution by proposing the establishment of a mechanismto help them attain their shared aspirations and affirm theirsolidarity.It is in this spirit that the Heads of State andGovernment of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries meeting at Durban  considered a proposal to establish within the Non-Aligned Movement  a mechanismconsisting of three funds financed by our own resources up to perhaps 0.1 per cent of gross national product or apercentage of export income. The funds thus obtainedwould be capitalized through investment in internationalfinancial markets.For Madagascar  this mechanism would helpintegrate the activities of developing countries into theprocess of financial globalization and would help resolve at least in part  their financial and debt problems  intandem with the actions undertaken by the internationalcommunity and the financial institutions. A large numberof speakers during that session recommended anevaluation of the capacity of the Bretton Woodsinstitutions to adapt to current realities. The three-fundmechanism could be among the basic documents for jointreflection on a new global financial architecture.In implementing the resolutions of the internationalcommunity  it is a key responsibility of each country tocreate a climate conducive to lasting peace and economicgrowth. Among the elements of this responsibility are theestablishment of regulations that are in keeping withagreed aspirations  good governance  the creation ofadequate systems for follow-up and monitoring  andrespect for the rules of democracy. In the present contextof global economic liberalization  every developmentactor has its own role to play  including the State as theprotector of the fundamental rights of its people and of itssovereignty and as a catalyst for developmentprogrammes.Madagascar  whose Constitution and national lawsare based on the principles of the United Nations Charter endorses those values. In that connection  we are engagedin the process of democratization  good governance andthe rule of law  along with economic and structuralreforms  to lead our country towards credible partnershipin the international system. Our authorities are nowcommitted to implementing recovery programmes aimedat stepping up the struggle against poverty and at creatinga climate conducive to the complete fulfilment of thecitizen.The institutional aspects of this programme includethe establishment of autonomous provinces and ofinstitutions provided for in the Constitution  and thecontinued reform of the civil service and the judiciarysystem.21In the economic sphere  the State is continuing to pullout of the production sector  and will be doing all in itspower to create an environment of vigour and competitionand to put financial administration on a sound footingthrough the creation of bodies to regulate sector-basedactivities.Finally  in the social area  public expenditures willreflect our priorities: education  health and safety  andsecurity. We are devoting special attention to programmesto make the most disadvantaged segments of the populationaware of their own responsibilities.Although the implementation of this programmedepends first and foremost on Madagascar’s own efforts  itis obvious that there are limits on our resources forguaranteeing a better quality of life for our citizens andthus for protecting their rights. The strengthening ofinternational partnership should therefore be viewed notonly from the financial but also from the scientific andtechnological standpoints  so that all countries may hope foran equal chance of success. Of that I am convinced."
"108",4487,"MDV",53,1998,"Allow me first of all tocongratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly. His election to thathigh office demonstrates not only the support thatUruguay enjoys in the international arena  but also theconfidence and trust that the members of the Assemblyhave in his ability to guide the work of this session to asuccessful conclusion. Allow me also to record mydelegation’s profound gratitude and appreciation to hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine  for theexemplary manner in which he steered the work of theGeneral Assembly throughout the past year.I would also like to take this opportunity  on behalfof my delegation  to express our sincere thanks andadmiration to the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  for his untiring work and dedication inpromoting the cause of this Organization. The Secretary-General deserves every assistance and cooperation fromall the States Members of the Organization in hisendeavours to fulfil the enormous responsibilities that wehave placed upon his shoulders in achieving the goals ofthe United Nations in a world full of political unrest ethnic conflicts and natural disasters.From the forest fires in South-East Asia  Europe andNorth America to the horrendous floods and droughts inAsia  Africa and the Americas  we have been witnessinga drastic increase in the number of natural disastersoccurring in various regions of the world with immenseloss to human life and property. The excessive effects ofthe environmental phenomena known as El Niño and LaNiña are sweeping across four continents with deadlyconsequences. Record-breaking temperatures around theglobe have spared no country. My country alsoexperienced record high temperatures early this year bleaching and killing coral reefs and causing enormous6imbalance in the ever so fragile ecosystem that surroundsour tiny islands.The Maldives may be situated outside the cyclone belt;we may have no rivers to flood  volcanoes to erupt or largeforests to burn. But my country is as vulnerable to naturaldisasters as any other. Indeed  for the past decade we havelived with the fear of being slowly engulfed by the risingwaters of the mighty Indian Ocean that surrounds us. Ourfears have become more alarming since we have seen thedeath and destruction caused by the tsunami in Papua NewGuinea and the devastating floods in Bangladesh. We havebeen forced to wonder what would happen if such adisaster struck our tiny  low-lying country.When my President addressed this Assembly on theimpending dangers of global warming and sea level riseover a decade ago  the extent of the threat posed by climatechange was not yet widely known or accepted. Today wenote that the realities of global warming are beingacknowledged by scientists and politicians all over theworld. However  mere acknowledgement of the danger isnot enough. As we have stated repeatedly over the years  ifwe are to arrest and reverse this lurking threat  we need theunwavering commitment and cooperation of the entireinternational community. It is important that we fully andurgently implement the commitments that we ourselveshave undertaken at various international conferences. In thisregard  I urge the international community  and especiallythe industrialized countries  to honour their commitmentswithout any further delay. My delegation believes that fulland unconditional implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States is essential for thecontinued development of those countries. My country  forits part  has done and will continue to do everything that isrequired of it to contribute to this goal  and we hope thatthe other Members of this Organization will fulfil theircommitments.Although we were happy with some of the agreementsreached at the Kyoto Conference of the Parties to theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changelast year  I regret to say that we were not fully satisfiedwith the achievements there. We accepted the KyotoProtocol because we felt that it contained some importantelements that deserved recognition and implementation  andbecause it is the best negotiated agreement available atpresent. In order to demonstrate our firm commitment tothe climate change negotiations  we went one step furtherand signed the Kyoto Protocol as the first signatory State.We call upon all States to become parties to the Protocoland implement the targets specified in it.In our small island States  the environment and theeconomy are intertwined very closely. Tourism andfishing are the two dominant economic sectors in theMaldives  and in a number of other small island States aswell. For the Maldives  the tourism sector has been themain source of foreign exchange earnings and hasaccounted for more than 40 per cent of gross domesticproduct. Effects of global warming such as sea level rise beach erosion  coral bleaching  increasing stress oncoastal ecosystems  salinization of freshwater aquifers anddamage to infrastructure from tropical storms are however  threatening to jeopardize the viability and thelong-term sustainability of our tourist industry. Given thelimited availability of resources  many small islanddeveloping States  including the Maldives  are not in aposition to carry the burden of the high cost ofenvironmental protection on their own. Therefore  we arefully convinced that without adequate  new and additionalfinancial resources  transfer of environmentally soundtechnology on concessional and preferential terms  andprovision for human resources development  even themere survival of our countries will be impossible.The vulnerability to external factors of theeconomies of small island developing States  especiallythe least developed countries among them  is a well-known fact. Globalization  coupled with the ecologicalfragility of small island developing States  hasmarginalized those countries from the present multilateraltrading system. Exports from least developed countrieshave grown far more slowly than world trade over thepast two decades  resulting in a continued decline in theirshare of world trade. Market access for least developedcountries is becoming narrower. Poverty still remains astumbling-block in their quest for achieving sustainablesocial and economic development. Therefore  we wouldlike to take this opportunity to call upon the major playersin the world economy and upon our development partnersto pay special attention to assisting small island Statesand other least developed countries in their efforts tobecome integrated into the world economy.When gross domestic product is used as an indicatorto determine the developmental status of a country  thesmall island developing States may appear to be moreprosperous than they really are. We believe that thecriteria now used by the Committee for DevelopmentPolicy in identifying least developed countries do not take7into consideration the special circumstances of the smallisland developing States and their vulnerability.The Committee has already recommended thegraduation of four small island developing States from thelist of least developed countries. The Maldives is unfortunately  one of them. The irony of this is that theeconomies of these countries are heavily dependent on oneor two industries  which may be extremely vulnerable toglobal economic and environmental changes and otherexternal factors. Moreover  while the Committee itself hasidentified the obstacles to integration into the globaleconomy and has called for continued official developmentassistance for least developed countries for at least another10 years  some of the countries most in need of suchassistance have been earmarked for graduation by the year2000. My delegation feels that it would be grossly unfair tograduate countries from least developed country statusunless they are able to sustain the momentum of growththat they have been able to achieve. Furthermore  thecriteria which were adopted in 1991 need to be reviewed inthe context of the increased pace of globalization during the1990s. Until such time as a vulnerability index isdeveloped  it would be very imprudent to graduate anysmall island States.This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  a major milestonein the promotion and protection of human rights  providingan essential basis for democracy  freedom and justice.Human rights apply without regard to race  gender  creed age  colour or economic status. But everywhere we look —north  south  east or west — the reality often falls short ofthe ideal. Therefore  we must redouble our efforts topromote and protect human rights the world over.The Maldives remains firmly committed to the causeof promotion and protection of human rights. I am happyto report that this year a new Constitution has come intoforce in the Maldives  providing stronger safeguards forcivil liberties and the fundamental rights of the people  andstrengthening the foundations and processes of ourdemocracy. We have also been able to achieve remarkableprogress in the realization of social  economic and culturalrights of the people through continued economicdevelopment and social progress. We believe thatdemocracy  development and peace are essential for therealization of human rights.The question of reform of the Organization has beenon the agenda of the General Assembly for quite sometime. Although the process of reform has proved to be adifficult one  my delegation does not wish to see itprolonged  for we believe that its momentum cannot bemaintained indefinitely. However  it is important that weremain focused on the central issue of making thisOrganization ready and capable of delivering the promiseof peace  justice and prosperity for all human beings irrespective of their colour  race  gender or belief  and thepromise of providing the means to protect ourenvironment and enjoy our fundamental freedoms. Thismeans that reform should cover the United Nationssystem in its entirety.On the specific question of the reform of theSecurity Council  my delegation appreciates the efforts ofthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question ofEquitable Representation on and Increase in theMembership of the Security Council and Other MattersRelated to the Security Council. However  we remainconcerned about the lack of progress in its proceedings and are worried about the prevailing difficulties which arepreventing an early agreement on this important issue. Weremain convinced of the importance of the early andsuccessful conclusion of the efforts to make the SecurityCouncil more responsive to and representative of thecurrent world realities in order to make it more effective.The commitment of the Maldives to arms control disarmament and international peace and security remainsunwavering. We are parties to all major multilateralinstruments relating to arms control and disarmament.Since its inception  we have been faithfully and regularlycontributing to the international Register of ConventionalArms. We signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT) last year and are presently going throughthe process of ratifying it. This morning we have signedthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction.My delegation is happy to note the considerableprogress the international community has made in thefield of arms control and disarmament  and commends thebilateral initiatives that have been proved to be sosuccessful. We believe that both bilateral and multilateralapproaches must reinforce and complement each other ifwe are to successfully achieve complete disarmament.In my delegation’s view  the establishment ofnuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace in variousregions of the world is a positive step towards achievingnuclear disarmament. At this juncture  we particularlystress the importance of the establishment of the proposed8nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia  and take thisopportunity to call upon all countries in South Asia toexercise maximum restraint and contribute to the realizationof this noble objective.In our quest to make the world a safer place we mustnot think only of the big Powers and the big bangs.Security is indivisible  whether in terms of geography orrange of threat. The continuing scourge of terrorism  whichrears its ugly and murderous head all too frequently  is asmuch the bane of international security today as is thespread of nuclear and other dangerous weapons. Thatterrorist groups may gain access to such weapons is analarming thought. For small States the threats posed byterrorists are allied with and magnified by the activities ofdrug-traffickers  money-launderers and other manifestationsof organized crime. That is why we have acceded to manyinternational conventions against terrorism and are activelyconsidering acceding to the remaining conventions.I would also like to take this opportunity to repeat theappeal made by my President at the historic fiftiethanniversary commemorative session of this body for thesignature and early ratification of the InternationalConvention against the Recruitment  Use  Financing andTraining of Mercenaries in order to expedite its entry in toforce. My delegation believes that in the face of thesethreats it is in the interest of the international community toprovide adequate safeguards for small States  which are inreality the front-line States against most of these evil deeds.We are happy to see the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court. Those who perpetrate warcrimes  genocide and other crimes against humanity mustnot be allowed to cross a border to safety or anonymity.This is why an international court that can systematicallyprosecute major war criminals wherever they are has to beestablished. This need has become more urgent in this post-cold-war period  which is characterized by the proliferationof conflicts of unprecedented ferocity. The horrifyingcrimes against humanity committed in Bosnia andHerzegovina  Rwanda  Sierra Leone and elsewhere cannotbe allowed to recur at any time or at any place. Theperpetrators of those crimes should be brought to justice.My delegation strongly believes that the ultimate legalguarantee of peace and justice in the world lies in thestrength and resolve of the international community and notin the strength and resolve of a single country.In conclusion  I once again would like to stress thevulnerability of small island developing States. Mydelegation believes that urgent and immediate action isabsolutely necessary to alleviate the difficulties faced bythese countries due to environmental degradation. If thepresent-day predictions for climate change were to cometrue  the Maldives and many other small island countrieswould have to face the frightful reality of extinction.Time is running out. Let us do something immediately.Otherwise  we will be no more."
"109",4534,"MEX",53,1998,"The election of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguayas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession is a source of pride for Latin America and theCaribbean. I am personally familiar with the talent experience and diplomatic skill of Minister Opertti and Iam convinced that these qualities will help to guide motivate and strengthen our work.My delegation would also like to express itsappreciation to Hennadiy Udovenko for the outstandingwork that he accomplished as President at the session thatjust closed.Last July  we had the honour of welcoming ourSecretary-General to Mexico. On that occasion weobserved anew his firm and resolute commitment tostrengthen the United Nations  adapting it to confront thechallenges of the end of the century. We recognize inKofi Annan a man with a clear vision of the future of theOrganization  and we are confident that he will know howto guide it in this transition stage towards a newmillennium.Mexico is a country with a profound multilateralcalling. Our desire to seek international agreement findsfertile ground for development in this forum. It is for thisreason that we are convinced of the urgent need tostrengthen it and to seek within it shared answers to thechallenges that the new global agenda presents.Mexicoâs commitment to the United Nations doesnot consist of words alone. A week ago  the Governmentof President Ernesto Zedillo reconfirmed this by sendingthe International Convention on the Protection of theRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of TheirFamilies to the Mexican Senate for approval. From thevery beginning of negotiations on that Convention  overwhich Mexico had the honour of presiding  we insisted onthe importance of having legal instruments to ensurerespect for and protection of the rights of migrantworkers. By taking that step  Mexico is showing itsunswerving commitment to the norms of international lawand is making progress in consolidating itself as a Stateof law.Convinced of the need to strengthen the internationalsystem that makes it possible for us to have the will andthe necessary instruments to confront together thechallenges of the end of the century  President Zedillopromoted the convening of the special session of theGeneral Assembly devoted to the problem of drugs. As ofthat meeting  principles of responsibility shared amongStates and of strict respect for sovereignty  territorialintegrity and non-interference in the internal affairs ofStates replaced the scenario of mutual recrimination andunilateral evaluations. We now have the bases for a globalconsensus regarding the policies that must be adopted by8States in order to consolidate an unprecedented effort atcooperation based on this new global  integral and balancedstrategy. Mexico will not regress in its efforts to implementthe commitments that we adopted last June.The international agenda today  as reflected in theagenda of the General Assembly  is very broad andcomplex. I would like to refer on this occasion to onlythree questions which I consider to be of particularrelevance: disarmament  which has been a constant issue inMexicoâs foreign policy; the reform of our Organization which will help to shape the community of nations in thenext century; and the international financial crisis  whichgreatly jeopardizes the efforts of our countries to attain fulldevelopment  as well as our ability to advance towards thefuture.As far as the subject of disarmament is concerned there is no doubt that the existence of nuclear arsenalsremains one of the central problems in internationalrelations. The threat of an atomic conflagration cannot bedisregarded  and we must reiterate our commitment tofashioning a world which is free of nuclear weapons. ForMexico  the objective of eliminating these instruments ofmass destruction is realistic and viable. It is time to setaside arguments that  for strategic reasons  have served toconceal the efforts of those who either do not want to giveup their present nuclear capacity or else want to join thegroup of countries that possess this destructive ability. Onecan contribute to nuclear disarmament only by eliminatingnuclear weapons. This is why we seek to broaden andstrengthen international commitments in this respect. Ourpolitical conviction is that we must achieve new agreementsthat remove this scourge from humankind.Mexico condemns all nuclear testing from principleand out of conviction. We affirmed this recently in the lightof the tests conducted by India and Pakistan. Far fromcontributing to stability and regional balance  such actionspromote the proliferation of uncertainty and fear. They alsocontribute to a climate conducive to the nuclear arms race.I would like on this occasion to reiterate Mexicoâsconviction that dialogue and negotiation are and will remainthe irreplaceable means of resolving disputes. It was in thatspirit that last 9 July we supported a ministerial statementthat sought to define a new agenda for the elimination ofweapons of mass destruction. We co-sponsors of thatdeclaration introduced a draft resolution that we hope willreceive the resolute support of Member States so that wecan in that way demonstrate the resolve of the communityof nations to move towards a world free of nuclearweapons.We are also committed to a new  integral approachto the subject of disarmament and the prohibition ofweapons of mass destruction or weapons with excessivelycruel and inhuman effects. There has been progressrecently in the Conference on Disarmament related tosecurity guarantees and the prohibition on the productionof fissionable materials destined to be used for suchweapons.We are likewise pleased at the growing supportbeing given to the treaties on anti-personnel landminesand on chemical and bacteriological weapons. Inparticular  we are gratified at the entry into force on1 March 1999 of the Convention on the Prohibition of theUse  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. Once again weurge the countries that have not yet done so to ratify assoon as possible these conventions that seek to eliminatesuch weapons from the face of the Earth.The proliferation of small arms and its link withcriminal organizations and drug-trafficking constitute asignificant challenge to the majority of nations.Combating this is a priority of the Government ofMexico. The Inter-American Convention against the IllicitManufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms Ammunition  Explosives and Other Related Materials which was the result of a Mexican initiative  is of crucialimportance and should therefore be taken into account infurther negotiations on transnational crime.In the present situation  which demands that weclearly define the framework for international relationsand adapt it in a timely way  the initiatives for reformingour Organization presented by the Secretary-Generalacquire special significance. The United Nations mustreform itself if it is to remain a central force in ourcollective lives.We must recognize that traditional mechanisms forharmonization and negotiation are showing clear signs ofexhaustion. We must rethink these strategies in order todeal with old and new problems. The consolidation of astructure which is truly democratic  transparent and wellbalanced  and which is consistent with the purpose andprinciples of the San Francisco Charter must be ourcommon goal.9In this context  I wish to stress the importance ofachieving a better balance between the principal organs ofthe United Nations. The Security Council needs to bereformed in order to strengthen its legitimacy representativeness  effectiveness  democracy andtransparency. In considering its structure  we must correctthe deficiencies in its present composition. It is not a matterof size; rather  the problem is the lack of balance in itsrepresentativeness. The Security Council must reflect theplurality and diversity of the membership of the UnitedNations  taking into account the profound changes inpolitical geography experienced in the last decade.Likewise  we must avoid repeating or even broadeningexisting inequalities. For this reason  Mexico is againstincreasing the number of permanent members. Let us notfall into the fallacy of believing that the Councilâseffectiveness resides in the right of veto. All rights bearresponsibilities and these must not be abused. Otherwise the necessary legitimacy which makes the Security Councilefficient and effective is eroded. This is why I wish toreiterate our appeal to the permanent members to join in anopen-minded way in designing a system to regulate thesphere of application of that privilege.Nonetheless  we recognize that structural reform of theSecurity Council will not in itself guarantee itseffectiveness. Hence  we insist on the need to progresstowards a thorough revision of its working methods and ofthe decision-making process. The community of nations hasgiven that organ the high responsibility of ensuringinternational peace and security. Under paragraph 1 ofArticle 24 of the Charter  the members of the Organizationrecognize that the Council acts in our name in carrying outthese functions.It is therefore clear that the Security Councilâs attitudemust be profoundly democratic and one of respect towardsthe General Assembly  in accordance with paragraph 3 ofthe same Article. Anything else would be a violation of theletter and spirit of the Charter  and would mean an erosionof the Councilâs legitimacy and its capacity to fulfil theresponsibilities that we have entrusted to it. We must breakthis vicious circle and make serious progress in the designand implementation of the needed reforms.My country will continue to participate actively in theWorking Group charged with reform of the SecurityCouncil. We hope to be able to submit to the Assemblyrecommendations that can receive widespread support genuinely reflecting the collective aspirations of all themembers of the United Nations.Our concerns about international security and thecapacity of our multilateral forums to respond effectivelyto new challenges are compounded today by theuncertainty caused by the international financial crisis.It is obvious that the Bretton Woods system hasshown its inability to respond adequately to the challengesof the current international financial crisis. We areundoubtedly faced with a situation of high risk whichthreatens to erode the important development attainmentsof our emerging economies. Given the vicissitudes of theinternational financial situation  we  the countries of LatinAmerica  have endeavoured to maintain our economicstrength through profound and sometimes difficultprocesses of structural reform. We reaffirm ourcommitment to continue to manage in a responsible waythe economic policy mechanisms that ensure our stabilityand growth.It is clear that this is not enough and that concertedaction is needed on the part of all countries andinternational financial organs. Heads of State andGovernment of the Rio Group meeting in Panama on4-5 September urged the countries in which the financialcrisis originated to adopt the measures needed to correcttheir imbalances. They made an appeal to the countries ofthe Group of 7 to immediately take the necessarymeasures to restore stability to financial markets and toensure the growth of the world economy. The Rio Groupalso appealed to international financial institutions to beinvolved more quickly and effectively in finding solutionsto the international financial crisis.Overcoming the present situation must be ourpriority. We must be creative in order to find formulasthat make it possible for us to avoid recurring financialcrises and banish the spectre of global recession. Just asthe community of nations has recognized the wisdom ofpreventive action to protect international peace andsecurity  it is now necessary to take that same course inorder to prevent cracks in the fabric of the worldeconomy.We must consider ways of implementing an earlywarning system that will allow us to detect financialcrises in time and thus avoid their harmful effects. In therecent past  there have been warning signs which inisolation were not identified as a prelude to more seriousproblems. We must collect such experiences  learn fromthem and prepare ourselves better for the future.10No country is free from responsibilities  just as nocountry is free of the effects of international financialimbalances. It is therefore up to us together and with aclear sense of direction to seek the proper mechanisms torespond early to signs that larger problems are imminent. Inthis universal forum  I reiterate our conviction that we mustact resolutely in the short term. We need to define anagenda for international economic stability. We appeal tothe Secretary-General so that  under his leadership andguidance  we can share experiences and proposals that willhelp us work toward global financial security.By attaining that goal of preventive diplomacy  wewill be contributing to the development and well-being ofmillions of persons who are victims of the financialuncertainty that today afflicts all economies  particularlythose of a relatively lower level of development  andendangers the stability of all nations.In the face of an uncertain political and economicpanorama  the role of the United Nations takes on newrelevance. Recent changes on the international scene yieldunprecedented opportunities but at the same time presentchallenges for which there are no easy answers. We mustact together in order to encourage the necessary consensusas that will allow us to take advantage of the benefits ofglobalization and confront its challenges.We must fortify our individual and collective capacityin order to take advantage of the positive trends towardspeace  stability  development and respect for law. Likewise we must strengthen our ability to banish confrontation violence  terror and inequality.The United Nations is the necessary forum for facinginternational problems and finding solutions to them. As wereaffirm our commitment to the purposes of the SanFrancisco Charter  we shall continue to promote theparticipation of the United Nations in the definition of theparameters of international coexistence."
"110",4583,"MKD",53,1998,"Allow me first of all to congratulate you Mr. Opertti  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session and  at the same time  towish you success in the performance of your importantfunction.Your predecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko successfully headed the fifty-second session. I amconvinced that  as a distinguished Latin American politicianof great experience and energy  you will also make anoutstanding contribution to the successful outcome of thissession.Allow me also to express our deep appreciation toSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his leadership and toextend to him our readiness for full cooperation.It is my special pleasure to address this Assembly onbehalf of the Republic of Macedonia. My country managedto avoid the turmoil of the war on the former Yugoslavterritory and to achieve its independence peacefully. Wealso managed not only to maintain our internal peace andstability but also to produce peace and stability in thetroubled and volatile region of the Balkans. Under muchmore difficult conditions than those prevailing in the othercountries in transition  we managed not only to finalize thereforms of the political and economic systems  but also todemocratize society  to build the institutions of the stateof law and to put into full function the mechanisms ofmarket economy. In addition  we managed to emergefrom the deep financial and economic crisis resultingfrom the high price we had to pay for these radicalreforms  and  above all  from the losses we suffered dueto the war in the region and the sanctions against ourneighbour  Yugoslavia.According to the last report of the World Bank  theRepublic of Macedonia  among all the countries intransition  today shares first place with Estonia in theresults on macroeconomic plans and is in fourth place inthe field of structural reforms. Over a number of years my country has had a stable currency and an annualinflation rate of about 5 per cent  and this year has had anindustrial production growth rate of over 10 per cent. TheRepublic of Macedonia  through its policy of equallygood relations with all its neighbours  has managed toestablish outstanding relations with almost all of them particularly with the Republic of Slovenia  the Republicof Croatia  the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  theRepublic of Turkey  the Hellenic Republic and theRepublic of Albania. It has also managed to become oneof the most active countries in all of the regionalinitiatives in South-Eastern Europe.Having committed itself to full integration into theEuropean and Euro-Atlantic structures  the Republic ofMacedonia is investing great efforts to enhance itsrelations with the European Union and to fully integrateitself into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)  thus contributing to the establishment of thenew Euro-Atlantic security architecture and to the unitedEurope of the twenty-first century.The Republic of Macedonia has achieved all of thisin a region in which  as is well known  we cannot yetspeak of lasting peace and stability  due to the crisis inBosnia  the crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo the recent events in Albania and the stalled processes ofdemocratization in some of the neighbouring countries.Other factors are the threats posed by illicit drug-trafficking  money-laundering  the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and small arms transnational and local terrorism and so forth.These are only some of the issues that burden theoverall situation in the region I come from  but these arealso issues that burden citizens worldwide. We still livein a period characterized by uncertainty and15unpredictability. Local wars and ethnic conflicts continue.The threat of weapons of mass destruction is increasinglyalarming. Organized crime  illicit drug-trafficking andterrorism trouble the whole world. Financial and economiccrises have become more frequent than ever  as haveenvironmental disasters.These complex issues  together with the issue ofglobalization  which marks the end of this century and willprevail in the coming one  as well as the issue of thereform of our Organization  are the main issues of debateat this session. That is why my country  the Republic ofMacedonia  attaches such enormous importance to thissession  with the expectation that the decisions to beadopted in those respects will improve our mutualcooperation and will strengthen the role of the UnitedNations in the spirit of its Charter.In the twenty-first century  our Organization will facea lot of new challenges  which will differ from those wehave dealt with during the past decades. The appropriateresponse to these challenges requires even furtherglobalization of cooperation  through the United Nations and we therefore should  in due time  do everythingpossible so that it will be prepared to tackle them.We believe that the Secretary-General?s reformprogramme is an excellent basis for this. These reforms arein the interest of all Member States  and we therefore fullyendorse them. We believe that they should bring aboutsubstantial improvement in the work of all the bodieswithin the United Nations family.In that regard  we are in favour of the eventualincrease in the number of permanent and non-permanentmembers of the Security Council  derived from and basedupon real political relations among Member States.The processes of globalization that have engulfed ourplanet are irreversible. They enhance our possibilities forconfronting international threats jointly  but they shouldalso provide benefits for all participating countries. TheUnited Nations is the only Organization which can definethe principles  norms and rules  and which can giveguarantees that both the obligations and the benefits will beshared by all members of the international community.Only in this way can we  all together  avoid the eventualnegative effects of these processes of globalization.As a modest contribution in that regard  the Republicof Macedonia has submitted a draft resolution for thissession on the prevention of marginalization of small andweakened economies of developing countries and ofeconomies in transition.The international community is witnessing manynew crises and conflicts  which most frequently turn intoviolence of an unprecedented intensity and fierceness. TheUnited Nations has all along been engaged in theirprevention and management. The lessons learned from thecrisis of the region I come from have indicated that ourOrganization  in dealing with them  needs to take thefollowing steps: first  concentrate on their root causes;secondly  concentrate on early warning; thirdly  activatepreventive diplomacy for peaceful settlement of thesedisputes before violence arises; and fourthly  deploypreventive forces in the neighbouring regions or countriesto prevent their eventual spillover.In 1992  when the war in Bosnia was spreading endangering the regions to the south  as well as mycountry  which was not yet a Member of the UnitedNations  we requested the deployment of a preventivemission along our northern and western borders. TheSecurity Council took a positive decision  and  as a result the first preventive United Nations mission  the UnitedNations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP)  wasborn.I avail myself of this opportunity to express thegratitude of my people and my country for this wisedecision of the Security Council  to the troop-contributingcountries — the United States of America  Norway Sweden  Finland and Denmark — and to all the othercountries that have contributed to the stabilization of thesituation along our northern and western borders.As members know  the UNPREDEP mission has allalong also acted as a deterrent to possible conflicts in theregion. This most successful preventive mission hasalways enjoyed the support of our citizens  as well as ofmy Government. We are particularly pleased that suchpositive assessments are contained in all the reports ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan.We are convinced that last year?s crisis in Albaniaand the crisis in Kosovo  which has particularlyintensified since the beginning of this year  would havehad much more negative consequences on peace andstability in the region had the UNPREDEP mission notstayed in the Republic of Macedonia or had its stay beenterminated last year  as some had proposed. Therefore  Iwould like to express our gratitude to all the States16members of the Security Council that adopted the resolutionextending its stay.I would also like to point to the need for theUNPREDEP mission to stay in the Republic of Macedoniauntil the situation in neighbouring Albania stabilizes and theKosovo crisis is peacefully settled. As an immediateneighbour  we are most interested in this and therefore through our constructive policy  we are trying to make ourown contribution to the efforts of the internationalcommunity to resolve the Kosovo crisis.Even though we see the solution in the framework ofthe Republic of Serbia and within the internationallyrecognized borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia it is well known that conditions have not yet been createdfor a lasting settlement. Therefore  we believe that theinterim solution proposed by the American diplomatChristopher Hill and the Contact Group will lead towardsresolving this crisis. The sooner this temporary solution isaccepted and implemented  the sooner will conditions becreated for reaching a lasting settlement of the crisis inKosovo  as well as for eliminating this threat to the stabilityof the region.Should this not happen  as an immediate neighbour weare most concerned by possible new waves of refugees which could destabilize not only the countries of the region but also those beyond. For the time being  this crisis hasnot significantly affected the peace and stability of theRepublic of Macedonia  in which there lives a considerableAlbanian minority. However  all of our citizens  regardlessof their national or religious identity  are concerned by apossible deepening of the crisis.Though some initial steps have lately been madetowards settling the Kosovo crisis and broader conditionshave been established to that end — such as  for example the decision of the Defence Ministers of the Partnership forPeace and of States members of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) from South-East Europe  to establishthe first multinational brigade for peace support operations;or the positive results of such regional initiatives as theCentral European Initiative (CEI)  the Royaumont Initiative the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)  the Initiativeof Cooperation of South-East Europe (SECI)  and theprocess on security  stability and cooperation in South-Eastern Europe — recent events in Kosovo  in which anumber of citizens were massacred  will very negativelyaffect the overall security situation. We condemn all suchuncivilized acts and underline that this is not the way toovercome the disputes or to settle them peacefully.Therefore  we call for the full mobilization andharmonization of the activities of the internationalcommunity  the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE)  the European Union andNATO  as well as our Organization  the United Nations since we believe that the possibilities for a peacefulsolution have not yet been exhausted. In that regard  mycountry has invested great efforts to make a constructivecontribution. As is known  at previous sessions of theGeneral Assembly  three resolutions for the developmentof good-neighbourly relations in South-East Europe thatwere proposed by the Republic of Macedonia wereadopted unanimously.At this session  we have submitted a proposal for theadoption of a new draft resolution on the prevention ofthe violent disintegration of States. I hope that this draftresolution will also be adopted by acclamation. By this the Republic of Macedonia is making a concretecontribution and giving strong support to the efforts of theUnited Nations to establish early warning of eventualconflicts  achieve political settlements of outstandingdisputes  and avoid their short-  medium- and long-termconsequences.In the period between the main parts of the fifty-second and fifty-third sessions of the General Assembly our Organization undertook a great number of activitiesto resolve the current and to prevent the outbreak of newcrises. The measures that could greatly contribute topreventing such violent conflicts certainly include theprosecution of war criminals and the punishment of thecriminal acts and atrocities they have committed.The successful completion of the Conference on thecreation of the International Criminal Court is ofhistorical importance. The Republic of Macedonia hasfully supported the outcome of the Rome Conference  aswell as the Statute that was adopted by the majority ofthe attending countries  including my own. Now  theGeneral Assembly should adopt the necessary decisionsto allow the Court to assume its full functions.In that regard  no less important is the fact  thatwithin a very short period of time  40 countries  includingthe Republic of Macedonia  have ratified the OttawaConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction. Thus  the Republic of Macedonia hasfirmly reaffirmed its commitment to the full eliminationof anti-personnel landmines  just as it has  by investingenormous efforts  made a great contribution to preventing17the proliferation of the small arms that abounded in theregion following last year?s crisis in Albania.Human rights  democracy and the rule of law haveproven to be the basic preconditions for the promotion ofpeace  security and the sustainable development of States.Since the very first days of its independence  the Republicof Macedonia has committed itself to the establishment ofthese preconditions.Today  as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  we feel the needto particularly emphasize that the adoption of thedeclaration on the defenders of human rights will not onlycreate new responsibilities for all the States Members ofour Organization  but will also encourage all the activistswho work for the protection of human rights throughout theworld.As a country whose Constitution abolishes the deathpenalty  we support the draft protocols to the Conventionfor the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen and the Convention against Torture  as well as abroad scope of projects and programmes in the field ofhuman rights  the rule of law and so on.Allow me to conclude by reaffirming the firmcommitment of the Republic of Macedonia to the objectivesand principles of the United Nations Charter. We are asmall country that struggles for progress and developmentwithin a still troubled and unstable region. Perhaps that iswhy we so strongly feel the threats and the challenges thatare common to the whole world. Thus  each and everyState Member of the United Nations  regardless of size andhuman potential  should make its contribution to decreasingthe risks of these threats and should also enjoy the benefitsof the current processes of globalization. The survival ofeach State  of each people  of the whole planet depends onthe common solidarity among all of us and on our commonresponsibility for future generations that could be unitedonly here  in our common Organization  the United Nations."
"111",4629,"MLI",53,1998,"Allow me first of all  on behalf of the delegation of Mali to extend to Mr. Didier Opertti my very warmcongratulations on his outstanding election to guide thework of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly.To ensure the success of the lofty mission entrusted tohim  I wish to assure him that he will have the full andopen cooperation of my country’s delegation. I would alsolike to congratulate his predecessor  Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  President of the General Assembly at its fifty-second session  for the skill and ability with which heguided our work at a time when the reform of the UnitedNations occupied a prominent place on the agenda of ourOrganization.I also take this opportunity to convey to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his team all our gratitude fortheir tireless commitment in the service of the ideals ofthe United Nations. The delegation of Mali fullyappreciates his programme of reforms designed to adaptour Organization to the changing realities of the world.The fifty-third session of the General Assembly hasopened at a time when the growing impoverishment of13the poorest countries  the resurgence of hotbeds of tensionand the difficulties incumbent in a stronger and more unitedcooperation are demonstrating that the rhythm ofinternational change is unprecedented and requires ourOrganization’s attention.Indeed  it would now appear that increasedinterdependence and the globalization of the economy arecontributing heavily to the rise of new tensions and creatingprofound imbalances for the developing countries. Theentire world  under the yoke of the logic of extremecompetition  is going through a phase of profoundconfusion. Everywhere  North and South  workers liveunder the remorseless threat of market rules  which growmurkier and more pitiless every day. Financial crises arelikely to undermine the developing countries’ efforts ateconomic reform.The imbalance between North and South is beingexacerbated  the gaps are widening and differencesbecoming entrenched. Characterized by a disparity inincome  access to services and the possibility of living indignity  poverty is growing in the developing countries andeven spreading within the developed world.My delegation certainly believes that  if genuine socialdevelopment and poverty reduction are to be achieved strong economic growth is necessary and that the poorestcountries must have access to markets in order to betterparticipate  on a sustainable basis  in the world economy. Inthis respect  we welcome the Secretary-General’s suggestionthat the developing countries be encouraged to participatemore actively in the drafting of new international standardsand in ensuring that these standards be transparent.Specifically  non-tariff barriers should be eliminated forAfrican and the least developed countries; vigorousmeasures should be adopted to ease the debt burden whether by converting the public debt of the poorestcountries into grants or by easing access to the DebtInitiative for the heavily indebted poor countries.But let us make no mistake: what is truly at staketoday is a globalization focused on sustainable humandevelopment. The challenge at the end of this century andinto the twenty-first will be to close the gap between Northand South.In this respect  as the highest authorities have said; weare convinced that the history of humanity is the history ofmen. Our constant quest for man is our roadmap for theworld’s progress. Our struggle will always be against ablind global market and in favour of sharing and solidarity.Let us have economic growth  by all means  but let ourwork and its fruit be shared so as to end theseinequalities. Let us not close our eyes: Where there isinjustice and iniquity  there is no peace.Respect for human and national rights is an integralfactor for economic prosperity and social equity  as wellas for promoting and maintaining peace and security. Wecan achieve such respect and right such imbalances if through a renewed political dialogue undertaken in allresponsibility and candour  we tackle the challenges withglobal vision and solidarity  in the conviction of truepartnership and shared and equal responsibility in thebuilding of a better world  a world of humanity.In this context  the major challenge facing theGovernment of Mali today is achieving sustainable humandevelopment through the struggle against poverty. Thisdevelopment hinges on a strengthened process ofdemocratization  the rule of law and the implementationof decentralization  the vehicle for local development designed and guided by the people.Mali is rigorously pursuing a freely agreed policy ofeconomic reform and entrenching its democracy. Thepositive results of these efforts  though fragile  are veryencouraging  but there remain problems and difficultieswhich our programmes — howsoever participatory —will require major outside assistance  peace and stabilityin our subregion  Africa and the world to solve. The sameholds true for many countries  especially in Africa  which through the courageous reforms they have undertaken  areonce again on the road to economic growth.Like them  we intend to continue and consolidate oureconomic reforms with strong growth aimed at povertyreduction. The international community  however  mustreverse the trend towards decreased official developmentassistance  which is essential to our basic minimum needs.We pay tribute to the tireless efforts of the UnitedNations system and our development partners and urge anincrease in official development assistance  without whichwe will scarcely enjoy the benefits of our reforms undertaken with so much sacrifice in the fight againstpoverty.We also need a partnership aimed at strengtheningour economic capacities to convert and market ourcommodities  facilitating their access to markets promoting the resurgence of our private sectors andincreasing flows of direct foreign investments. All thismust take place in a more favourable economic14environment if unemployment and poverty are to beconsistently reduced.The end of the cold war transformed the internationalcontext for United Nations missions and activities. In thesphere of international peace and security  our Organizationis now taken up with domestic conflicts that often haveserious international repercussions. Unfortunately  in manycases  recent events allow us to assume that this type ofconflict will continue to claim our attention.Now that certain guiding principles in the area ofpeace and security are widely accepted  it is quite obviousthat peacekeeping will remain our priority objective. It istherefore essential that we improve our preventive systemand strengthen our institution’s capacity to organize andlead these operations efficiently and successfully.For its part  Mali will always fight for more peace justice and solidarity throughout the world. For us  securityand development are indissoluble. The grave crises shakingthe world  and Africa in particular  strengthen ourconviction that the United Nations  the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) and the subregional organizationsmust cooperate closely with one another in the search foreffective early warning  conflict prevention andmanagement  and peacekeeping mechanisms. In thisframework  and with particular reference to Africa  theprevention of conflicts and disarmament are of greatconcern.Given all of the challenges of democracy  developmentand security that Africa must meet  President Alpha OumarKonaré of the Republic of Mali said a few weeks ago that:“The development of the continent must bemanaged on new terms. The difficult situation of ourcontinent has arisen almost everywhere as a result ofdemocratic failures  which we must redress in ouryoung and fragile democracies by an essentialdemocratic commitment. We must promote pluralisticexpression  the transfer of power and dialogue foundedon law. We must eschew violence.“The future of our continent does not lie in theemergence of ethnic republics  which will only lead usinto general anarchy. It is important  we feel  not todeny  much less crush expressions of autonomy. Theymust be managed politically in a democratic contextof the basic transfer of power and the emergence oflocal power with a view towards regional integration.“Thirty-eight years after the independence wonin 1960  there is no question of redrawing theborders inherited from colonialism  but nothingtoday can justify border conflicts. We must be ableto settle all border disputes politically. It is essentialtoday that any ill-defined border be corrected inserenity  not in the heat of tension. The OAU’sMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Managementand Resolution should be able to speed that forward.“At a time when everyone is welcomingintegration  borders must have a different meaning.They must be managed as border countries  jointareas and shared space.”President Konaré also said that:“Post-election periods are also increasinglybecoming times of conflict. This must be preventedby the proper preparation for elections  becausesome recent incidents of electoral challenge havethreatened democracy. People must know that theonly access to power is through the ballot box whence all legitimacy flows. Everyone mustparticipate.“We must therefore seek to control electoralchallenges without ever endangering pluralisticexpression and the transfer of power. Strength mustalways reside in law and right — the whole law andright and nothing but law and right — and opposeany impulse to disorder and violence.”In the view of the President of the Republic of Mali “Africa can no longer be managed as it has beensince 1960. A new Africa is on the move  an Africawhich wishes to define its future and takeresponsibility for its own development; which issearching for solidarity  not alms; which isresponsible and confident. It is an Africa once andfor all on its own feet  a democratic Africa.”That Africa more than ever needs security and peace. Tohave that security and peace  Africa must  like the rest ofthe world  be free from weapons of mass destruction andconventional weapons  particularly light weapons.With regard to disarmament  Mali hails the decisionsof the Review and Extension Conference of the Parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT)  in particular on the Treaty’s permanent extension.15We also hail the entry into force on 29 April 1997 of theChemical Weapons Convention and the progress innegotiations regarding the Biological Weapons Convention.We warmly welcome the coming entry into force of theConvention on anti-personnel landmines. Mali  whichratified this Convention early on  began last May destroyingits stocks  which Mali’s army had never used.While welcoming also the notable progress made oninstruments regarding weapons of mass destruction  Mali isdeeply concerned about conventional weapons  whichremain an area so far unexplored and not subject tointernational norms. Recent conflicts  particularly in Africa which have claimed so many human lives  are fuelled notby weapons of mass destruction  but by light weapons. Thatis why my country  together with the United Nations andthe countries of the West African subregion  has undertakenspecific initiatives to counter this phenomenon.We are pleased by the welcome given to PresidentKonaré’s initiative regarding the moratorium on the import export and production of light weapons by the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)  and morerecently by the Organization of African Unity during theOuagadougou summit and by the Non-Aligned Movementat the Durban summit. But it is important now to go furtherto reduce and contain the threat of the proliferation of lightweapons. This moratorium is in essence a confidence-building measure  aiming over the long term to strengthenthe ability of the Governments involved to exert strictercontrol over the illegal traffic in light weapons.Here we wish to pay tribute to the far-sightedness andresponsible commitment of the ECOWAS countries  whichplan to announce a moratorium soon. This will be aprecedent demonstrating Africa’s clear will to preventconflicts by exerting pressure on the means which inciteand fuel them. The international community must keep upthe momentum by mobilizing around the issue of lightweapons  supporting the moratorium and making it effectiveby implementing a programme of coordination andassistance for security and development  which underpin themoratorium and help to widen it.We are an active party  and we support the proposalsthat emerge daily for tracking the illegal traffic in lightweapons and establishing a control mechanism. Althoughit is a complex and difficult matter  we must work togetherenergetically to perfect such a mechanism.There must be more support for resolution 52/38 C regarding assistance to States for curbing the illicit trafficin small arms and collecting them  and States mustdemand more on this issue of the international communityand the United Nations  which we congratulate on theaction already taken. We must show our commitment tomake vigorous progress in creating a mechanism to curbthis matter and  at the same time  actively supportinitiatives such as the moratorium  consciousness-raisingand the mobilization of all State and non-State actors tobetter ensure peace and reduce the threat posed by thisillegal proliferation to people  particularly women andchildren  and to States and democracy.On behalf of the delegation of Mali  I would likeonce again to voice our solidarity with and compassionfor all the peoples of the world who are still living inconflict situations.Regarding the Middle East  we are deeply concernedover the deadlock in the peace process and the policy offait accompli aimed at changing the religious  civil andhistoric character of the Holy City of Al-Quds. Theagreements concluded on the basis of “land for peace”must be implemented. We reaffirm our unswervingsupport for the just struggle of the fraternal Palestinianpeople to realize their legitimate right to self-determination and to establish an independent State.We remain convinced that in Angola scrupulousrespect for the Lusaka Protocol is the only path to lastingpeace and reconciliation. I wish once again to honour thememory of Matre Alioune Blondin Beye  SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  and the sevenmembers of his team who tragically perished on the roadto peace in Angola.We have continually voiced our grave concern aboutthe suffering of the fraternal people of the Libyan ArabJamahiriya as a result of the embargo imposed on it.While noting recent events  we should like to recall thedecision taken by the heads of State or Government of theOAU at their recent summit and to reaffirm that the timehas come to end the suffering of the fraternal Libyanpeople by lifting the embargo and finding a lastingsolution.Concerned about acts of terrorism  which wecondemn in all its forms  Mali firmly condemned thelethal attacks against diplomatic missions of the UnitedStates in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi. We reiterate ourcondolences to the families of the victims and call forgreater international cooperation to prevent and combatthis threat. We also call for the convening of an16international conference on terrorism under the aegis of theUnited Nations  whose exclusive competence in the area ofinternational peace and security we need increasingly toreaffirm.I would like to conclude on the issue of the expansionof the Security Council. Clearly this body  which wasconceived in a context quite different from today’s  cannotbe left untouched in the course of reform. My delegationendorses the demands of Africa for democratization and anequitable distribution of the two categories of seats permanent and non-permanent  with all the prerogatives andpowers that go with them.We are convinced that a restructured United Nations democratic and given essential powers  can help ensure amore orderly management of world affairs by eliminatingthe injustices  disparities and selfishness which threatenmankind  so that nations can finally  in a spirit of solidarity devote their resources and their energy to the progress anddevelopment of mankind."
"112",4670,"MLT",53,1998,"I join other delegations incongratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly. We are confident that your ability andexperience will successfully guide our work during thissession. I also wish to express our gratitude to yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko whose presidency was characterized by energy and drive.Freedom first and foremost. That rallying cry hasinspired peoples and nations throughout this century. Itgave birth to brave acts of courage during two worldconflicts. It gave sustenance in the struggle fordecolonization. It gave stamina and resilience during andafter the dark days of the cold war.Freedom first and foremost. That was the solidplatform on which citizens worldwide stood their groundwhenever authoritarian regimes sought to erode democracy human rights and the rule of law.Freedom first and foremost. That ideal buttressedPresident Roosevelt in his effort to give birth to theUnited Nations.As we strive to build a better world and struggle toconquer the uncertainties of our times  we the peoples ofthe United Nations continue to cherish those four essentialhuman freedoms identified by President Roosevelt in hisspeech to Congress on 6 January 1941: freedom of speechand expression — everywhere in the world; freedom ofevery person to worship God in his own way —everywhere in the world; freedom from want to secure forevery nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants —everywhere in the world; freedom from fear through aworldwide reduction of armaments so that no nation willbe in a position to commit an act of physical aggressionagainst any neighbour — anywhere in the world.Underlining these four freedoms  President Rooseveltstressed that they were “a definite basis for a kind ofworld attainable in our own time and generation”  not a“vision of a distant millennium”.For the past 53 sessions world leaders have gatheredhere in this General Assembly to take stock ofhumankind?s progress in achieving those noble aims forwhich the United Nations was founded. Each year bringswith it new unknowns  new challenges  new tragedies.Yet each year we also see movement  in small steps or instrides  towards a more secure world.Building a world where peace  justice and freedomreign supreme is a duty for all of us who serve in publicoffice. This responsibility becomes more onerous as weadvance towards the dawning of the new millennium.Eight years ago I was privileged to serve thisAssembly as its President. The future then beckoned. In1989 the world had witnessed the collapse of the Sovietbloc. Millions had reacquired their freedom. In 1990 theidyllic aftermath of the Bush-Gorbachev Malta summit wasshattered by the invasion of Kuwait. In those times ofeuphoric uncertainty I called on Member States to revitalizethis General Assembly and ensure a symbiotic relationshipbetween the Organization?s principal organs. The call forreform prevailed. It bore fruit and continues to give results.Reform is essential for the Organization?s well-being.It is even more essential for the future of humankind.Eight years ago I signalled the danger of a curtain ofpoverty dividing the world  with the same direconsequences as the Iron Curtain had on world peace andsecurity. That danger remains and has become morepronounced.Last week the President of the United States remindedthis Assembly that “the gulf is widening between theworld?s haves and have-nots”. (A/53/PV.7  p. 11)Narrowing that gulf is essential if we desire a secure globalsociety bereft of rage. That rage often transforms itself intoacts of violence.The ill winds that blow at present  devastating theeconomies of many States and crippling progress builtthrough the hard work of so any families around the world further aggravate this situation.The United Nations is the unique instrument topromote and protect the universal enjoyment of humandignity. Significantly  one of the first tasks that thisOrganization set itself was the drafting of a UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. In commemorating thefiftieth anniversary of its adoption by this Assembly  werenew our commitment to its content. That document is notoutdated  nor can it be easily replaced. It proclaims humanrights that by their very nature are universal  inherent andindivisible.The Declaration is comprehensive and demands anobservance that is equally comprehensive. A selectiveapproach damages the Declaration and the wider conceptsthat it represents. It undermines a vision of society inwhich respect for human rights is paramount and universal.There is  however  a significant lack in thisDeclaration. It is an instrument with no judicialmechanisms or sanctions. Has the time arrived to learnfrom the experience of the regional human rightsconventions  in particular the European Convention which through its mechanisms instituted the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights and through the right ofindividual petition further guarantees a judicial processaimed at ensuring effective enforcement?There can be no freedom without democracy.Equally  there can be no democracy without the exerciseof individual freedoms. We underscore this reaffirmationas we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.We the peoples look up to United Nations forleadership in resolving the ills of our times. Yet we thepeoples are the United Nations. The United Nations is us.Attempts to project or depict the United Nations asan entity alien to the rest of the international communityor as an Organization that can determine or predeterminethe fate of peoples and society are both erroneous anddangerous. This Organization depends on a continuationof that balance of principles and institutions intrinsic inthe Charter. This balance is best conserved byconsolidating the process of consensus-building that hasrendered so many positive results in the past half-century.Imposition of the will of some over the will of the othersis rarely conducive to harmony in any circumstance. It iseven less so in a forum of sovereign nation States.There are instances when the will of the majoritytraces important paths for future cooperation betweenStates. Yet the effort to ensure the widest a prioriadherence to the principles being negotiated is alwaysessential  particularly if we desire such agreements to beuniversal in their application. This demands a diplomaticand political effort that may appear exasperating. Still  itis the path that best conserves the delicate balancebetween the sovereign rights of States and the emergenceof a new world order.We have partaken of the sorrow sown by violenceand war. We have survived the tensions of blocantagonism and nuclear proliferation. We have grappledwith the anguish of division and mutual suspicion. Theimminence of a new millennium naturally generates hopes2and expectations. Foremost is the longing for the fulfilmentof the promise garnered at the end of the cold war.Throughout this decade we committed ourselves  devisingtools to deal with uncertainties as they emerged. Yetsuffering and strife continue to plague the planet.Shocking violations imposed upon us the duty toprovide future generations with an international judicialmechanism to fairly establish the guilt of the perpetrators ofwar crimes and provide for their punishment. We actedwith the swiftness demanded by the might of right. We setthe framework to deal with crimes that are an affront tohumanity?s sense of justice and compassion.In Rome last July we adopted the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court. We thus lay the foundationfor an effective and credible institution that in itself is adeterrent against the commission of heinous crimes fallingunder its jurisdiction. We hope that the momentum gatheredin institution-building is retained to enable the Court to startfunctioning and effectively deal with crimes againsthumanity whenever they occur.Vigilance remains the order of the day. With goodreason  the world proclaimed victory at the indefiniteextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT). The ratification of the latter by two of thenuclear-weapon States is a welcome and positive step. Yetpitted against these positive developments were recentnuclear tests carried out by two non-signatories. We haveseen the partial dismantling of nuclear arsenals  but alsowitnessed the dangers of proliferation. Such actions fuelinsecurity and mistrust. We join others in strongly urgingthese two countries  and indeed all countries  to exerciserestraint. Nuclear testing is a stark reminder of the dangersever present in nuclear weaponry.Malta welcomes the statements of intent made by thePrime Ministers of India and Pakistan in this Assembly lastweek. They augur well for the universality of the NPTregime. No effort must be spared to ensure universaladherence to and compliance with the relevant treatiescovering not only nuclear weapons but also all weapons ofmass destruction. The nuclear disarmament agenda must bekept on track. The dangers that loom are not limited to thepossession and use of such armaments by nuclear-weaponStates. The spectre of nuclear terrorism haunts us as wecombat illegal trafficking related to the possession production and use of such weapons.The dangers remain multiple. Chemical andbiological weapons pose destabilizing threats. Bydisturbing contrast  technologies for their acquisition anduse are relatively easy to develop. Conventional arms-trafficking also remains a major menace.The establishment of the Organization for theProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) sets out aregime of control and verification that strikes a balance curbing proliferation of chemicals for weapons use whilesanctioning beneficial use of chemicals by a wide rangeof industries. Malta is proud to have served on theExecutive Council in its initial stage.It is our hope that the verification protocol onbiological weapons may likewise hamper  discourage anddisallow the use of biological components for war conflict or conquest. Images of the maimed victims oflandmines buttress our commitment to outlaw theseweapons. Malta was among the first to sign the OttawaConvention  and ratification is being processed. We joinothers in saluting its entry into force early next year. Thisbrings closer the prohibition on the use  stockpiling production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and theirdestruction.Equally threatening  intrusive and destabilizing areinternational crime  drug-trafficking and terrorism. Thesecontinue to poison the very roots of our societies spreading corruption  fear and suffering. No Governmentcan ignore or shield itself from such phenomena.Complacency is both dangerous and unreal. UnitedNations efforts to further international cooperation tocombat and curb these afflictions  particularly those of theVienna Centre for International Crime Prevention  deserveour full and unwavering support.Freedom  democracy and social justice havefortunately become oft-used terms within thisOrganization. They are indeed the basic elements of allour efforts. They reflect the will to give substance to theCharter?s reaffirmation of fundamental human rights  thedignity and worth of the human person  and the equalrights of men and women and of nations large and small.Commitment to human rights must be matched byaction to promote social justice and better living standardsin larger freedom. The human rights that we promote andprotect must be complemented by the provision of asocial safety net that preserves the dignity of all. This isa principle that the Maltese people hold dear.3My Government was again returned to office less thanthree weeks ago. The cornerstone of our agenda is therestoration of confidence and direction and the generationof wealth  to the benefit of all our people: our only andmost precious resource. This demands the resumption of astrategy that invests in improving health and educationservices with the same vigour with which we revolutionizedthe social and economic infrastructures of our country. Weare committed to social justice and thus to the well-beingof those most vulnerable to suffering if left to their owndevices in times of economic transition. The true measureof progress remains social justice that buttresses equity andpersonal dignity and ensures the universal enjoyment offundamental human rights and freedoms.The change in Administration has also brought aboutthe resumption of the march towards Europe which wasbriefly frozen during the previous 22 months by theprevious Administration. Malta?s application formembership of the European Union has been reactivated.An overwhelming electoral mandate reconfirms theEuropean vocation of our people  repeatedly expressed infree and fair elections during the past two decades. Thechoice of our people is clear  and the path we shall followis equally clear. Our immediate objective is to rejoin thosecountries earmarked for the next enlargement of the Union.Though much remains to be done  the commitment of thepeople and the Government is deep-seated.We do not choose to be European. We are European:European in history and culture  in economic structures andpolitical organization  in security concerns and ethicalvalues. Anchorage in the European Union is the naturalculmination of our development process  our traditions andour culture. As in any other member of the Union  debateon the benefits of membership and the consequent rightsand responsibilities continues. This is an intrinsic aspect ofthe democratic process. Nowhere in Europe have choicesbeen easy or straightforward  but everywhere in Europe  thefreely expressed will of the people has prevailed. This is afundamental characteristic of Europe  a political union builton respect for the individual and the democratic will of itspeoples.Enlargement of the European Union to gather peoplesand nations within its fold in a spirit of pluralism  solidarityand cooperation is more than just a process. It cannot beseen as just an exercise in augmenting the membership. Itis much more than that. It is a political demand for therealization of the Union and its credibility in global politics.Characterized by reciprocity  it is a quest in peace-building a venture that in less than half a century has continued totransform the founding fathers? ideal into a tangiblereality.Like all other Mediterranean States  Malta views theproblems of its region with particular concern. At thecrossroads of cultures and civilizations  the Mediterraneanis disproportionately burdened with turmoil  tension andconflict. Resolution of each crisis demands positive actionby the protagonists directly responsible. Yet the worldcommunity can contribute  through its efforts and goodoffices  to constructing an environment conducive tonegotiated settlement. The bitter heritage of the pastsometimes impedes that contact which is an essential firststep in the setting up of negotiating structures. In thiseffort to overcome obstacles  the international communityand individual statesmen have given their fair share.The open wounds that still afflict the region demandrenewed engagement lest they continue to fester anddegenerate into volatility that would risk spilling over tobroader areas.The Cyprus question has long been one of theseopen wounds  having political and stability repercussionsthat go beyond the geographic dimensions of the islanditself. A solution in conformity with the resolutions of theUnited Nations can have enduring positive effects for allthe parties concerned in the dispute.The ever pervasive problems encountered by theMiddle East process are of particular concern. In spite ofvarious efforts  this process has come to a virtualstandstill. We believe in the importance of revitalizingand respecting the commitments undertaken through andafter the Oslo peace accords. We urge all sides to respondpositively to current initiatives aimed at restoring dialogueand hope.The new millennium is the commemoration of thebirth of Jesus Christ  when the message that was broughtto us was “peace on Earth”. This is precisely the messagethat is central to the initiative that will be debated duringthis session  Bethlehem 2000. How sad it will be if theland of the nativity is still at war 2 000 years after thatmessage.The Euro-Mediterranean process was a significantstep in bringing together European and Mediterraneancountries comprehensively to address issues that stillbeleaguer the region. The impasse in the Middle East hasdealt a blow to the Euro-Mediterranean process. Onehopes that this is but a temporary setback. Stability in the4Mediterranean must rest on multiple initiatives that nurturecooperation through gradual confidence- and security-building measures. This is the crux of our insistence on theneed to establish a stability pact for the region. Initiativessuch as the addition of a parliamentary dimension to thisprocess of dialogue  promoted by the Inter-ParliamentaryUnion  the setting up of a council or forum ofMediterranean States and the eventual creation of aconference on security and cooperation in theMediterranean deserve serious consideration.Regional approaches complement and reinforce effortsat the international level. In 1992  at the Helsinki follow-upmeeting of the then Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe (CSCE)  Malta proposed that theCSCE should declare itself a regional arrangement by theterms of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. Wenote with satisfaction that relations between what is nowknown as the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE) and the United Nations continue to bestrengthened. Apart from institutional benefits reapedthrough regular contact between the two organizations  whatis more relevant is the increased cooperation on the groundin the various parts of the OSCE area.Ever since Dipoli  the site of the first preparatoryphase  Malta has contributed to the evolution of the OSCEprocess. It has promoted the Mediterranean dimension ofthis process. Mediterranean and European security remainintimately and reciprocally linked. Strengthening of securityand cooperation in the Mediterranean is an importantelement for stability in the OSCE region. Consistentengagement by successive Malta Governments hascontributed towards the greater involvement of theMediterranean Partners for Cooperation in the work of theOSCE. We will continue to work to further thisrelationship.The regional approach has reinforced cooperationthrough the interlocking of different and distinct Europeanand international organizations. In this respect. Malta payshomage to the role of the Council of Europe in protectingand promoting dignity  human rights and fundamentalfreedoms and in nurturing the principles of humansolidarity.We are particularly heartened by the Secretary-General?s stated intention to consolidate the partnershipbetween regional organizations and the United Nationsthrough a more structured  rational and cost-effectivedivision of labour.Distinct from other organizations  theCommonwealth also continues to advance avenues ofcooperation. Cross-regional projects among countriessteeped in a common tradition continue to unfold. Maltaupholds this international effort through its participationin various programmes that promote sustainabledevelopment.Different scenarios face this Organization. We havelearnt that negotiating agreements is not enough.Universality remains a priority as we develop the tools todeal with emerging problems. Reform of thisOrganization is another priority. Many of its structuresmust better their effectiveness. Reform is not an end initself — it is an ongoing process that necessarily requiresperiodic review. We must remain open to the challenge ofchange by being innovative and adaptive  seeking toreorient structures established in a different time  withoutbetraying the core principles that remain ever valid.Malta has steadfastly fostered awareness of the needto revitalize the General Assembly. With its universal democratic character  this Assembly is the ultimateexpression of the principle of the sovereign equality ofStates. Yet  conditioned by the past  the Assembly has notfully realized its potential. As the international consensus-building forum  its role can be further strengthened  thusenhancing its authority.Progress has been registered in deliberations onSecurity Council reform  but consensus still evades us.The question of which categories of membership toexpand dominates the discussion and attracts attention.However  other important issues  such as the transparencyand openness of the Council  continue to develop. Maltaattaches great importance to this aspect  which benefitsthe widest majority of States.Security Council decisions legally bind all MemberStates. Thus  procedures enhancing consultations betweenCouncil and Assembly members are of immense value.Improved methods introduced in recent years  whilenurturing the symbiotic relationship that should bondCouncil and Assembly  prove that conferring does nothinder the Council?s ability to intervene with the requiredswiftness.In seeking solutions  even on what type of expansionthe Security Council should undergo  the need for generalagreement must be underscored. General agreement is notto be seen in quantitative terms; rather  it should beviewed as a guarantee that solutions have the political5support to come to fruition. Agreement on this sensitiveissue must be comprehensive if it is to stand the test oftime. Lack of consensus on expanding the permanentmember category should not impede further progress.We support the fallback position of the Non-AlignedMovement to limit enlargement to the non-permanentcategory for the time being. This will allow the process tomove forward without prejudice to an eventual continuationof deliberations on permanent category expansion.The environment has been the focus of uninterruptedattention since the end of the cold war. The ushering in ofa new era of cooperation has enabled the internationalcommunity to address different areas requiring concertedaction. An unprecedented number of treaties andconventions have been negotiated. Treaty bodies andinstitutions now function effectively  addressing distinct butrelated areas of concern.In this new international milieu  the Charter?s broadernotion of trusteeship assumes renewed relevance. Duringmy presidency of this Assembly  the Trusteeship Councilwas about to discharge its responsibility for the last of theterritories placed under its custody. Some suggestedfreezing or dismantling the Council. I proposed that theTrusteeship Council be given additional responsibility incoordinating international endeavours that safeguarddifferent areas of the common heritage of humankind.Since then  many others have proclaimed themselvesfavourable to this type of reform. The identification of newadditional responsibilities for the Trusteeship Council formspart of the reform package proposed by the Secretary-General last year.We have also taken note of the recommendations ofthe United Nations Task Force on Environment and HumanSettlements in its report to the Secretary-General earlier thisyear. The positive openness to this proposal is encouraging.Malta intends to participate actively in the recommendedconsultations to be undertaken by the Executive Director ofUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) inpreparing for the next regular session of the GoverningCouncil.The application of the principles of trust and commonresponsibility in a number of international conventionsmakes their coordination the natural task of the TrusteeshipCouncil. The principle of trust should retain its rightfulplace in the institutional framework of this Organization.The International Year of the Ocean is in its finalquarter. Many feel that a forum is needed to consider theclosely interrelated problems of ocean space as a whole.The Independent World Commission for the Oceans  onwhich I have the honour to serve  has vigorouslyaddressed this vital issue. Malta suggests positiveconsideration of the suggestion that this Assemblyinstitute a biennial committee of the whole to reviewocean-related questions in an integrated manner.Notwithstanding our collective endeavours  peaceremains daily threatened in different parts of the world.United Nations deliberations in response to such threatsrightfully enjoy a high profile with the public and in themedia. In most instances  the success of thesedeliberations rests on the sheer dedication of the UnitedNations officials in conflict zones and particularly on thecourageous sacrifice of troops forming part of UnitedNations peacekeeping operations.This year  we commemorate the fiftieth anniversaryof United Nations peacekeeping operations. Peacekeepershave faced risks  humiliation  threat and death. Thisnotwithstanding  they have never faltered in their duty ordetermination to bring hope where despair often prevails.Despite increasing risks  the United Nations has notshirked its responsibilities. Indeed  it has broadened itspeacekeeping mandates. I had the opportunity topersonally bring this Assembly?s message of solidarityand support to peacekeepers serving in different parts ofthe world. During the past five decades  the number ofpeacekeepers who have paid the supreme sacrifice hascontinued to grow. We salute and pay tribute to theirmemory.Like others who have addressed this Assemblybefore me  I have outlined some challenges facing ourOrganization. New problems continue to emerge presenting us with daunting and confounding scenarios.Yet  despite all the odds against it  the United Nations haswithstood the test of time. It has survived because itinvested faith in humankind and dispensed hope wheremisery prevailed. It has gradually built the required toolsto foster international cooperation.Obstacles may continue to loom large  yet at no timein human history has the potential been so great. We mustseize the opportunity provided us to act in concert. Ourcommitment to the United Nations is unwavering. Ourcommitment to sparing humankind from untold sufferingis strong. Together  we can head into the new millenniumimbued with the founding fathers? determination to save6succeeding generations from the scourge of war. We owethis to ourselves. We will strive to bequeath it to ourchildren."
"113",4716,"MMR",53,1998,"At the outset  Sir  let meextend to Mr. Opertti the felicitations of my delegation onhis unanimous election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session. We are confident thatunder his experienced leadership we will be able to achievesubstantive progress in the deliberations of this Assembly.I should also like to take this opportunity to pay awell-deserved tribute to his predecessor  Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  who presided over one of the most eventfulsessions of the General Assembly. In particular  I wouldlike to express our gratitude for his skilful stewardship ofour deliberations on the reform package of the Secretary-General  which led to the successful completion of animportant phase in the United Nations reform process.Last year the Secretary-General presented us with hismost comprehensive and far-reaching proposals for thestrengthening and reinvigoration of this Organization. Wewere also able to adopt two landmark resolutions  52/12A and 52/12 B  during the substantive part of the fifty-second session to enable us to reform this Organizationand to introduce new mechanisms  including the Office ofDeputy Secretary-General  to improve its performance.With these new mechanisms  the Organization has beenable to renew the emphasis on economic  social anddevelopment activities. We are pleased that we have Ms.Fréchette  an outstanding person with vast experience  asthe first Deputy Secretary-General of the Organization.Early this year we were able to take further steps tomove forward the reform process  a process that is stillcontinuing. We would like to thank the Secretary-Generalfor his timely submission of reports and additionalexplanations in response to resolution 52/12 B. We hopethat the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General will pushforward the ongoing process.As a developing nation  we hope that the reformprocess will strengthen the ability of the United Nationsto fulfil its role and functions in the field of developmentand to respond effectively to the development needs ofthe developing countries. In this respect  the establishmentof a Development Account under the reform process is awelcome step.Forward movement in the overall reform of theUnited Nations is not matched by similar progress in thereform of the Security Council. We are somewhatdisheartened over the lack of tangible results on the coreissues in the deliberations of the Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation onand Increase in the Membership of the Security Counciland Other Matters Related to the Security Council. I amsure that every State Member of this Organization sharesthe view that the reform of the Security Council is one ofthe most crucial aspects of the entire United Nationsreform process. This process will be considered by theworld community as seriously inadequate  and much lessgenuine  if we fail to produce a Security Council that istruly representative of the present membership of thisOrganization and can effectively respond to futurechallenges. We do not believe that a body that is notdemocratic and representative can really look after theinterests of the broad membership in its cardinal task ofmaintaining international peace and security.11We all have been engaged in in-depth and intensivediscussions of the various aspects of the Security Councilreform for almost five years now. Although we had hadhigh hopes that the latest rounds of discussions of theWorking Group would produce general agreement on themore contentious issues related to the Security Council  thedesired goal remains elusive. We nevertheless are gratifiedto note that the Working Group has made encouragingheadway in its deliberations on measures conducive toimproving the working methods and transparency of theCouncil?s activities. We believe that expansion of theSecurity Council in a balanced manner is one of the mainelements of Security Council reform. We are discouragedby the fact that it is on this core element that substantivedifferences among the delegations still remain. Thesefundamental differences have proved to be a major obstacleto our forward movement towards a general agreement ona common package.As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  we ingeneral subscribe to the common position of the Movementon Security Council reform. However  we wish to makesome observations on certain core issues on which we feelwe should register our position.First of all  my delegation wishes to emphasize thatthe objective of the entire process of Security Councilreform is not the mere addition of a couple of countries toits permanent membership. Although it has been acceptedin principle that three permanent seats should be allotted todeveloping countries from Asia  Africa and Latin America the mode of their identification and selection  despitevarious suggestions and concepts on the table  seemsintractable at this juncture and remains unsettled. Myanmarwould view with concern any move or measure biasedtowards particular candidates. Myanmar believes thatcountries which are capable of contributing to internationalpeace and security should be permanent members in theexpanded Council. We also favour the expansion of theSecurity Council in both permanent and non-permanentmemberships.We are now being provided with an historicopportunity to devise ways of selecting new permanentmembers for the Security Council.Although there has been noticeably strong support forexpansion of the Security Council in its permanentcategory  we have not been able to translate various ideason this question into a viable formula acceptable to all. Inthis connection  the idea of rotating new permanentmembers  which the Organization of African Unity hasdecided to apply to the African countries  is a verysignificant concept. There appear to be a growing numberof States attracted to it  and Myanmar is one of thosecountries. This is a concept submitted by a particularregion for itself and not meant for export to other regions.Nevertheless  we should not rule out the concept as oneof the possible options applicable to other regions such asAsia  in the event that other modalities of selection oroptions fail to command enough support. It is vitallyimportant that expansion of the Security Council in bothcategories of membership take place simultaneously forall regions.Myanmar is one of the 74 members of theOrganization which has never been a member of theSecurity Council. However deficient in its presentstructure and undemocratic in its practice the SecurityCouncil may be  its role in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and the contribution madeby its members are highly appreciated by the Union ofMyanmar. Myanmar has therefore always given seriousattention to the annual election of five non-permanentmembers of the Security Council.At the same time  to enhance the role of non-permanent members  now generally looked upon asperipheral  we could seek a solution by improving theworking methods of the Security Council.Inextricably linked to the expansion of thepermanent membership of the Security Council is theveto. Debate on this question has been continuing bothoutside and inside the Organization since before thefounding of the United Nations. Nevertheless  little hasbeen done in the years since then to rectify its injustice.Given the present state of the discussions  the questionpromises to haunt us in the future  regardless of howstrongly we may feel about the practice. While a largemajority of Member States are demanding its curtailmentand eventual elimination  permanent members continue tobe entrenched in their position that they cannot accept anydiminution of their rights and prerogatives  including theveto.In the context of extending the veto to newpermanent members  two main views have emerged. Oneview argues for its extension to new permanent members.In their opinion  the new members will be inferiorwithout the veto. The other view states that the enjoymentof the veto  as now constituted  by the new permanentmembers would entail setbacks. Therefore  to limit theveto in scope and application for the moment with a view12to its eventual abolishment is  in their view  necessary. Inthis connection  there have been many sensible suggestionsto curtail the veto?s scope and application. They are veryinteresting indeed. The most sensible of them  in our view is the idea of curtailing its application to issues that fallunder Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. In fact the provisions of Chapter VII are the rationale of theSecurity Council.Myanmar has consistently held the view that the vetois unjust and anachronistic and that its ultimate eliminationis the most logical conclusion. However  we accept that itis unrealistic to eliminate the veto at present. We thereforeconsider it unfair and discriminatory to deny the veto tonew permanent members until we can seal the fate of thisunwanted relic of the past. We strongly feel that newmembers should be endowed with the same rights andprerogatives now enjoyed by the current permanentmembers.I have dealt at some length with the United Nationsreform process. I have done so because the effectivefunctioning of the United Nations in fulfilling its role andobjectives is of critical importance to developing countrieslike mine. It is here at the United Nations that developingcountries have sovereign equality with big and powerfulcountries. It is here at the United Nations that we have tomaintain and safeguard time-bound principles such assettling international disputes by peaceful means; refrainingin international relations from the threat or use of forceagainst the territorial integrity or political independence ofany State; and refraining from intervention in matters whichare essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.These are principles that are of the utmost importanceto developing countries like Myanmar so that they can haveindependence not only in name but also in reality. Only aUnited Nations that is genuinely democratic will ensure thatthese principles are neither diluted nor made flexible toserve the domestic political needs of big and powerfulnations. In the age of a single super-Power  we arewitnessing too often attempts to use the United Nations asa political tool of the big and powerful nations.Too often we are seeing the will of the internationalcommunity become synonymous with that of the singlemost powerful nation or a group of powerful nations. Onlya United Nations that is genuinely representative can lookafter not only the interest of big and powerful nations butalso the interest of the whole United Nations membership including the weakest among them. That is why we placeso much importance on the United Nations reform process.We had high hopes that the end of the cold warwould usher in a new international order. We had highhopes that resources used for the arms race could bediverted to development activities. We had hoped forpeace and tranquillity to prevail worldwide. Instead wesee instability and conflict in most regions of theworld — the crisis in the Middle East  the tragedy inBosnia  in Kosovo  in Angola  in the Sudan and inAfghanistan  to cite just a few. In many of thesesituations  the United Nations had to spend millions andmillions of dollars in its peacekeeping efforts. This hascaused a serious drain on the resources of theOrganization  whose finances were already in direcircumstances mainly because of a single Member thathad withheld its contributions for domestic politicalreasons.It would be a truism to say that the United Nationsand its operations are overstretched. Much of its resourceshave been diverted from development activities expenditures that could be put to more useful purposes forthe promotion of the economic and social advancement ofall peoples.In spite of this situation  there are those who wouldlike to use the United Nations to interfere in matterswhich are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction ofMyanmar. The present Government assumed Stateresponsibility to restore stability and normalcy to thecountry when it was in a state of chaos and anarchy. Inthe last few years the Government has restored stabilityto the country. The insurgency  which has burdened thecountry for the last 50 years  is now almost a thing of thepast. Peace and tranquillity prevail throughout nearly thewhole country. These are hard-earned achievements especially for a multi-ethnic nation such as Myanmar.We have attained stability in Myanmar through ourown endeavours. We have not imposed any burden on theinternational community. We are therefore very muchdistressed that there are those who would like to use theUnited Nations to intervene in matters that are essentiallywithin our domestic jurisdiction. It was the GeneralAssembly itself which adopted numerous resolutions including the resolution on the Charter of EconomicRights and Duties of States  which reaffirms the sovereignand inalienable right of each and every State to choose itseconomic and political systems. We in Myanmar havechosen the path of democracy.It is also an irony that at a time when Myanmar hasopenly and repeatedly declared that it is now in the13process of building a genuine democratic State with amarket-oriented economic system  political pressure hasbeen put on us by those who not only would like us toadopt democracy but would also like to transplant ademocracy according to their own mould. It is unfortunatethat these proponents of a particular type of democracywould like to use the United Nations to interfere in ourdomestic political process. We in Myanmar strongly believethat the path we have chosen is the right one and is themost suitable to our tradition  to our culture  to our nationalethos and  most importantly  to the aspirations of ourpeople. We shall resolutely continue our endeavours tobuild a modern  democratic  peaceful and prosperous nationin Myanmar.Nevertheless  there are some who entertain concernsthat difficulties relating to human rights practices in onecountry could create economic problems in another. In fact such transborder human movements occurred amongneighbouring countries in the past for various reasons. Theimportant aspect is that there must be the will to resolveand overcome such difficulties through mutualunderstanding and respect. The idea of relying on others toresolve our own domestic problems should be discouraged.We still live in an unsettled post-cold-war periodwhere pockets of rising tensions still exist. We are alsoconfronted with a vast array of major problems awaitingsolutions. Since we last met  we have witnesseddevelopments that give cause for hope as well as for deepconcern. As the only multilateral forum to deal with theproblems of peace and development  the enhanced role ofthe United Nations is now more necessary than ever. We allhave trust in the Organization?s capability to avertcatastrophes of all kinds and to find global solutions to themajor problems of the world. We also have trust in ourcapacity to work together. It is imperative to redouble ourconcerted efforts if we are to be successful in the creationof a peaceful and prosperous world order. In this commontask  Myanmar pledges  as a responsible Member of theUnited Nations  to continue its strong support for theendeavours of the Organization to promote the economicand social advancement of mankind and reaffirms itscommitments to the purposes and principles of the Charter."
"114",4773,"MNG",53,1998,"Allow me  Sir  to joinpreceding speakers in congratulating Mr. Opertti and themembers of the Bureau on their well-deserved election and to wish them every success in discharging theirduties. May I also take this opportunity to express mydelegation?s deep appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenkoof Ukraine for his outstanding stewardship of the work ofthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly.One of the pressing issues that mankind is facingtoday is globalization and the growing interdependence ofStates and their effects on international relations. Theseobjective processes will to a great extent determine thenature of international relations at the outset of thecoming millennium. They open up enormous opportunitiesand at the same time are fraught with grave challenges.So far  the future does not seem to be bright for some especially for the least developed  the weak and thevulnerable  which could result in an even wider gapbetween the rich and the poor  between nations and withinthem. The increasing interdependence of States and itseffects are clearly demonstrated by the Asian financialcrisis  which spilled over to some other parts of theworld  adversely affecting the world economy  exactinghigh economic and social costs and raising seriousconcerns about the operations of financial markets.We believe that the present financial crisis calls forthe international community to create a crisis earlywarning system. Therefore  naturally  these issues are onthe minds of peoples and on the agenda of this Assembly.We believe that the high-level meetings held last week inthis Assembly will provide a good basis for serious constructive and fruitful debate and decisions on theseissues.After decades of virtual isolation from worlddevelopment  Mongolia is taking active measures tointegrate itself into the global economy on the basis ofwhatever comparative advantage it has. Though concretesteps have been taken in the past few years  includingopening up its economy to the outside world and joiningthe World Trade Organization  the negative consequencesof globalization  which are felt especially by the weak andvulnerable  including by the landlocked developingcountries  risk marginalizing it economically  if notpolitically. We therefore believe that the worldcommunity  when searching for adequate responses toglobalization  should take into account the challenges thatthese vulnerable States and those in transition are facingand take measures to facilitate their adaptation to thechanging realities.21We believe that the international community shouldpay increasing attention to the situation of landlockeddeveloping States. They are handicapped by theirgeographical location and remoteness from world markets which  as experts point out  curtails their annual growth by1 to 3 per cent at the very least. It is no wonder that of the30 landlocked developing countries  16 are among the leastdeveloped  with per capita gross domestic product of lessthan $400. The progressive marginalization of thosecountries is evident from the fact that the 300 millionpeople who live in those countries share only 0.5 per centof world trade  with the trend moving towards furtherdecrease.Like other landlocked developing countries  Mongoliais taking measures to overcome the difficulties inherent tolandlocked countries by closely cooperating with itstransitneighbours. In this regard  Mongolia is looking forward toconcluding a subregional agreement with Russia and Chinathat would facilitate transit transportation for all threecountries and the subregion in general.Bearing in mind the state of the world?s economy andthe role that the United Nations could play  Mongoliasupports the efforts to increase the role of the UnitedNations in economic and social development  especially ofweak and vulnerable States  and in creating an effectivemechanism of international cooperation for development.Likewise  it is in favour of convening internationalconferences on development financing and on partnershipfor development.Mongolia believes that the notion of developmentshould not be limited only to economic growth. In thisregard  we fully agree with the wider notion that isreflected in the human development reports.Economic development  like other human activities  isdirectly connected to the state of the world?senvironment — in fact  with the future of mankind. Inmany countries  especially those that are environmentallyvulnerable  the question of protecting the environment isdirectly linked to their security and even ultimate survival.The changes in the world climate  its caprices that we seeand feel  lead us to believe that greater attention and effortsare needed to cope with this ever growing and creepingdanger  the effects of which are incalculable. Therefore  webelieve that the first International Decade for NaturalDisaster Reduction should be followed by a second decadewith greater focus on reaching the targets set forth  as wellas strengthening existing mechanisms and creating  wherenecessary  new international mechanisms.Mongolia  following its centuries-old tradition ofliving in harmony with nature and the environment declared 15 per cent of its territory — an area larger thanCentral Europe — a protected natural reserve. In the nearfuture that area will comprise one third of its vastterritory.Political stability is essential for economicdevelopment and fruitful cooperation. The end of the coldwar was an important milestone in international relationsthat raises hopes for further strengthening peace anddeveloping cooperation among nations. However  thepost-cold-war years have vividly demonstrated that peaceand stability need constant efforts by States to deepenmutual trust and to settle disputes by political means.Though some political flashpoints have been eliminatedand problems solved  new ones are still arising. Asreflected in the general debate the situations in the MiddleEast  in the Balkans and in southern Africa are causingconcern on the part of the international community.Mongolia supports solving those problems on the basis ofnegotiation  in the spirit of cooperation  without the useor threat of force. In this connection  we would like toreiterate that the Korean peninsula should be turned intoa zone of peace  stability and prosperity in the interests ofthe Korean people  as well as the peace and security ofNorth-East Asia.In another part of the Asian continent  in South Asia the international community was shocked by nuclear teststhat could exacerbate tensions and undermine the existingnuclear non-proliferation regime and the test ban.Mongolia  situated between two nuclear Powers  standsstrongly against any nuclear tests and  like othercountries  expressed its deep concern and regret over therecent tests. Therefore  we welcome the declaration of thePeople?s Republic of China not to resume nuclear testsand express the hope that the latest encouraging signalsfrom Pakistan and India will lead to strengthening thenon-proliferation regime and moving closer to theobjectives of nuclear disarmament. In this respect Mongolia supports the eight-Power Declaration entitled“Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for anew agenda”. Likewise  we express the hope that thenegotiations on banning the production of fissile materialfor nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive deviceswill soon lead to the conclusion of a verifiableinternational treaty.Mongolia believes that non-nuclear-weapon Statescan  in their own way  contribute to strengthening nuclearsecurity and enhance stability. In this context  it welcomes22and supports the efforts of the Central Asian States toestablish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in their region. For itspart  Mongolia is working to institutionalize its nuclear-weapon-free status  which would turn its territory into anarea of peace  stability and predictability. All nuclear-weapon States  as well as the entire Non-AlignedMovement  fully support Mongolia?s efforts toinstitutionalize its nuclear-weapon-free status.Mongolia is in favour of strengthening the armscontrol and verification regimes set up by the Conventionson chemical and biological weapons. They will  in ourview  given a genuine will to enforce them  strengtheninternational security. Likewise  Mongolia supportsinternational efforts to curb the spread of conventionalweapons  especially of small arms and light weapons.International peace and security will be strengthenedwhen and if international law is strictly observed. Webelieve that international law should be strengthened as thecore of security relations. In this connection  Mongoliawelcomes the recent adoption by the Rome Conference ofthe Statute of the International Criminal Court. We are infavour of a truly independent court and look forward to itsearly establishment and coming into operation. This wouldconstitute an important milestone in strengtheninginternational law and justice.Mongolia condemns all acts of international terrorism.Therefore  it resolutely condemns the recent terroristbombings in Kenya  Tanzania and Northern Ireland andbelieves that international terrorism should be fought byjoint efforts and in full accordance with the norms andprinciples of international law. It believes that acts ofterrorism should be condemned wherever  by whomeverand against whomever they are carried out.The fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights is an event ofspecial significance. It is connected with the tremendouschanges that have taken place over the last half-century inthe concept of human rights and the practice of ensuringthem.Thanks to the Declaration  unprecedented highstandards have been set for protecting human dignity. Sincethe adoption of the Declaration in 1948  those standardshave been strengthened and further developed by numerousinternational treaties and conventions and have becometruly universal.The legal foundations reflecting the world standardof protection and promotion of human rights were laiddown in Mongolia?s 1992 Constitution. Since then it hasbeen further developed and concretized by relevantlegislation and the establishment of the necessaryadministrative and legal machinery based on UnitedNations human rights treaties and conventions to whichMongolia has acceded. At present preparations are underway for the establishment of a national human rightscommission. A draft law to that effect has been submittedto the Parliament for its consideration and adoption.As it confronts the many global problems before itand approaches the new millennium  the worldcommunity places great hopes in the activities of a strongand well-equipped United Nations. In that connection Mongolia firmly supports the Secretary-General?s reformpackage.In implementation of decisions and recommendationsof United Nations summit conferences on major globalsocial and economic problems  and in support of the so-called silent revolution  my Government has adopted anational action programme for the twenty-first centuryand  in close partnership with bodies of the UnitedNations family and non-governmental organizationsoperating in Mongolia  is launching an ambitious project:the One-World Conference Series  which is aimed atensuring an integrated follow-up to the world conferencesand summits held in the early 1990s.Reform of the United Nations cannot be completewithout the reform and expansion of the Security Council.In that connection  I would like to reiterate myGovernment?s conviction that the Council should reflectpolitical realities  and  besides becoming more effective its membership should be enlarged to reflect moreequitable representation. It is our hope that the GeneralAssembly debates on this important issue will soon resultin concrete decisions. We believe that energetic effortsshould be undertaken to make the Millennium Assemblyan occasion for reforming and revitalizing the SecurityCouncil.On the proposal of Mongolia  the General Assemblyis drafting a set of guiding principles for conductinginternational negotiations. We believe that thedevelopment and adoption of such a set of principleswould contribute to enhancing the effectiveness ofnegotiations as the most universal instrument forinternational cooperation.23My Government continues to pursue its political andeconomic reforms. Mongolia?s commitment to theirrevocable realization of the principles of democracy liberalism and market economy is irreversible  despite thegreat difficulties of the transition period. The future majorpolicy priorities will continue to include  inter alia strengthening of democratic institutions  enhancement of thebasis of political stability  acceleration of privatization inthe economic field  and social protection of the population especially of its vulnerable groups.On behalf of the Mongolian people and itsGovernment  I take this opportunity to express our deepgratitude to the international community  especially donorcountries and international financial institutions  for theirassistance to Mongolia since it joined the community ofopen societies and democratic nations.A century that has been full of dramatic andconsequential events is drawing to a close. It has been acentury of great social upheaval and experimentation aswell as of unprecedented social progress and technologicaladvances. We believe that a more promising millennium isin store for all humankind and that the world communitywill be able to meet the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury. Mongolia stands poised at this historic juncture tomake its contribution to the efforts of the United Nations tobring about a brighter and more secure future."
"115",4815,"MOZ",53,1998,"At the outset  allow meto join the previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Operttimost sincerely  on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session. His election is indeeda recognition of his excellent qualities as an experiencedand seasoned diplomat committed to the ideals of peace.As I congratulate him today  I am reminded of theexcellent role played by Uruguay in assistingMozambique to consolidate peace and stability. On behalfof my Government  and on my own behalf  I wish toseize this opportunity to express our heartfelt tribute tothose young men who lost their lives in the search forpeace in my country.Let me also pay well-deserved tribute for theexcellent manner in which his predecessor  Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  discharged his duties as President of theGeneral Assembly at its last session.I also wish to commend the Secretary-General forhis continued devotion to peace and developmentworldwide. His recent initiatives in this regard deservemy Government?s full support  and we look forward tocontinuing to work closely with him.In my last address to this body  one year ago  Ispoke of positive changes which had taken place in mycountry. I am pleased to reconfirm today that the peopleof Mozambique remain firm in their determination toundertake bold steps aimed at ensuring and furtherstrengthening democracy  good governance and the ruleof law. Within this context  the first municipal electionswere held in June this year  thus consolidating the processinitiated with the holding of the general elections fouryears ago. Preparations are currently under way for theforthcoming general elections  scheduled for 1999.The implementation of structural and economicreforms under the most severe circumstances over the last11 years should be seen within this perspective.Mozambique is emerging step by step from the scourgesof war and is gradually proving that  with hard work and31adequate international assistance  the country can and willbe a valuable partner in the international market place.We believe that by concentrating on economicfundamentals — including low inflation rates  a stablecurrency and a transparent exchange-rate policy  stimulatingprivate-sector growth and increasing foreign and domesticinvestment flows — our economy can achieve the desiredresults. These measures have enabled Mozambique toachieve a growth of 14 per cent in its gross domesticproduct last year  compared to a real average growth ofabout 6.6 per cent from 1991 to 1996. In addition increased agricultural production  coupled with theprivatization of over 900 Government-owned companiesand the rehabilitation and restructuring of the main elementsof infrastructure — such as roads  ports and railways —have significantly contributed to raising productivity andhave played a critical role in achieving these encouragingeconomic results.The report of the Secretary-General on assistance toMozambique  which I highly commend  provides a furtheraccount of the state of the Mozambican economy today.Moreover  the Governments of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) region  in closecooperation with the private sector  are taking aggressivesteps towards regional integration. These include  inter alia the launching of mega-projects  such as the MaputoDevelopment Corridor  a joint initiative by theGovernments of Mozambique and of South Africa; the $1.3billion MOZAL aluminum smelter  recently announced bythe London Metals Exchange  a multi-partnershipinvestment; and the Libombo Spatial DevelopmentInitiative  involving Mozambique  Swaziland and SouthAfrica.Notwithstanding these positive developments  we arestill faced with acute problems whose solution is vital if thecountry is to maintain the needed stability. The most criticalof these  without a doubt  is the debt burden  whichcontinues to be the single most significant impediment tonational development.My Government welcomes the decision taken in Aprilthis year by the World Bank and the International MonetaryFund (IMF) with regard to the eligibility of Mozambique todebt relief within the framework of Heavily Indebted PoorCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. We regard this Initiativeas a recognition by the international community of myGovernment?s continued commitment to undertake soundpolitical and economic reforms  and also of the sufferingendured by our people throughout these years of theimplementation of such measures.While representing a significant step in the rightdirection  the Initiative in its present form is not yet adefinite solution to the debt problem. Further assistanceby the international community  and the creditorcommunity in particular  is required. We need to ensurethe irreversibility of the positive developments  especiallytaking into account that even with current relief measures poor countries  particularly the least developed countries remain poor. We would therefore encourage the creditorand donor communities to continue to review andconsider new relief measures  including the cancellationof official bilateral debt  in order to ensure that theaffected countries can redirect their meagre resources tosocial programmes.As a matter of fact  the eleventh meeting of theConsultative Group for Mozambique is taking placetomorrow in Maputo. The holding of this meeting onMozambican soil for the first time symbolizes thegrowing relationship between Mozambique and itspartners  and my Government will do its utmost to ensurea successful outcome of the proceedings with the creditorcommunity.Moreover  we are still confronted with the issue ofthe prevailing threat of anti-personnel landmines  whichcontinue to disrupt the very existence of nations andpeoples. For this reason  my Government has signed andratified the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnelMines and on Their Destruction. We did so as arecognition of the imperative need to find durablesolutions to this issue. We warmly welcome the fortiethratification  by Burkina Faso  which will enable theConvention to enter into force  and we hope othercountries will do the same as soon as possible.In this regard  my Government offered to host inMaputo next year the first meeting of States parties to theOttawa Convention  in accordance with article 11 of theConvention. It is our hope that the meeting will result inthe adoption of meaningful recommendations to addressin a comprehensive manner the issue of anti-personnellandmines  particularly international cooperation andassistance and other relevant issues envisaged by thisimportant instrument of international humanitarian law.We are eager to welcome all of you to Maputo.32Let me take this opportunity to express myGovernment?s deep gratitude and appreciation to thepioneering role of Canada on this issue. It is my hope thatall interested parties will take an active part in thedeliberations within the framework of the draft resolutionto be presented in the First Committee.Last April  the Secretary-General presented his reportto the Security Council on the causes of conflict and thepromotion of durable peace and sustainable development inAfrica. We wish to commend him for his vision inpreparing that report. The Secretary-General?s reportrepresents a valuable contribution for a better understandingof African problems and offers concrete recommendationsfor durable solutions by the international community. Allefforts should be deployed to ensure that that report doesnot follow the negative examples of other similarlyimportant reports prepared by the United Nations before.I am particularly thankful for the recommendation thateconomic sanctions should be better targeted in order toprevent the unnecessary suffering of innocent people  as wehave been witnessing over the years.The concept of peace-friendly structural adjustmentprogrammes should be fully implemented in order tominimize the negative consequences of such programmesfor the well-being of peoples. As outlined in theserecommendations: conditionalities should not be antitheticalto peace processes; donors should not cut off funds fromweak governments which  in good faith  are makingpopularly supported efforts to implement peace agreements;aid should be focused on high-impact areas to reducedependence; donors should strive to ensure that at least 50per cent of their aid to Africa is spent in Africa; and theHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiativeshould be expanded to benefit more African countries.These recommendations deserve our full support  and whatis now required of us is to find the best ways and means ofputting them into practice.I would also agree with the Secretary-General when hestresses that  without political will  Africa will remainbehind  with nothing to offer to future generations. Forthese reasons  I wish to endorse the proposed holding ofSecurity Council meetings at ministerial level on a biennialbasis to assess efforts undertaken and actions needed in thisregard. Moreover  the convening of the Security Council atsummit level within five years to discuss the situation inAfrica could not be more timely. Indeed  it is high time forthe Council to devote the necessary attention to Africanproblems if the international community is to ensure abetter future for the African continent.Today as yesterday  globalization is a matter of fact.However  we cannot afford to leave vast segments ofnations and peoples unattended and still confronting basicchallenges such as famine  epidemic diseases andinadequate water distribution  among other challenges. Asan African  I am certain that Africa is prepared toshoulder its responsibilities in this regard  so that togetherwe will be able to work towards a common goal.The crisis which initially begun as an isolated casein the Asian economies has rapidly spread to virtually allcontinents. Its consequences have demonstrated that nocountry in this globalized economy is immune to thesuffering of other nations. Adequate solutions lie insustainable development based on partnership indevelopment cooperation. The persistence of extremepoverty in developing countries  particularly in the leastdeveloped ones  will continue to represent a threat to theeconomies of developed countries. The new vision whichappears to emerge from the Bretton Woods institutions bringing together the United Nations and other partners inthe solution of social problems  will contribute toaddressing major challenges facing our countries today.I would like to take this opportunity to praise thetwo-day high-level meetings of the General Assemblyheld a few days ago on renewal of the dialogue onstrengthening international cooperation for developmentthrough partnership and on the social and economicimpact of globalization and interdependence and theirpolicy implications. The meetings demonstrated the needto bring together governments  the private sector andother relevant segments of civil society in the search forsolutions to global problems.We therefore hope that the ongoing reform of theUnited Nations will open new windows for theOrganization to strengthen its role and functions in thepromotion of international cooperation for the social andeconomic development of developing countries. As hasbeen emphasized  the United Nations  by virtue of itsuniversal membership  is the most credible instrument forperforming development tasks.Regional conflicts continue to be a major concern onthe agenda of the United Nations. Despite the recentsigning of understandings at Victoria Falls  the hostilitiesin the Democratic Republic of the Congo continueunabated. We are deeply concerned by the course of33events  which threatens not only the territorial integrity ofthat country but also peace and stability in the Great Lakesregion as a whole. We believe that with good will there canbe a solution addressing the concerns of all parties involvedin this conflict. Neither Africa nor the internationalcommunity can afford to add a new chapter of conflicts ofregional proportions  especially taking into account thatvirtually all other long-standing conflicts in that continentcontinue to defy our collective imagination.With respect to Angola  we are equally concerned withcontinued procrastination by Mr. Savimbi in theimplementation of undertakings within the framework of theLusaka Protocol and of relevant Security Councilresolutions. It is  indeed  the failure of União Nacional paraa Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) to live up to itsobligations which is leading the peace process in Angola tothe brink of collapse. Both the international community andthe parties concerned have an obligation to rescue thesuffering people of Angola from the prospect of yet anotherconflict of major proportions. The attainment of peace inAngola would undoubtedly contribute to bringing aboutneeded stability in the region.We are fully associated with the progress made by theCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries and by theEconomic Community of West African States in the searchfor the peace which has eluded Guinea-Bissau since theoutbreak of hostilities in that country. These positivedevelopments underline the importance of political will bythe parties concerned  which should prevail in conflictsituations. My Government is also encouraged by thedevelopments concerning Western Sahara  and looksforward to the holding of the referendum in that Territory.It is our hope that wisdom and statesmanship willprevail  and that peace and stability will ultimately becomea reality in Somalia  the Horn of Africa  the Sudan andother troubled regions of the African continent and beyond.We are encouraged by the recent developmentsconcerning East Timor  as illustrated by the outcome of themost recent meeting  held in New York  between theMinisters for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and of Portugalunder the auspices of the Secretary-General. We wish toencourage them to pursue further these efforts with a viewto finding a lasting and internationally acceptable solutionto this issue.My Government has been following with keen interestthe latest developments in the Middle East. We have goodreason to be disappointed by the course of events since thelast session of the General Assembly. Without acomprehensive and just solution to the question ofPalestine  which is the core of the conflict in the MiddleEast  as well as respect for the legitimate interests of allpeoples of the region  the prospects for a lasting peaceremain in danger.In addition  the latest developments concerningnuclear proliferation in South Asia have added newelements of destabilization to the already volatileinternational security environment. The new arms race inthat region constitutes a major setback in the internationalefforts aimed at ensuring peace  security and stability inthat region and in the world at large. Rather thanproviding security guarantees for the countries concerned the new reality has in fact exacerbated the tensions in theregion.This session of the General Assembly takes place atan auspicious time for all the peoples of the world: 1998will be recorded as the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. Through concreteactions the international community must honour thosewho have lost their lives in defence of human dignityduring the 50 years of the existence of the UniversalDeclaration. Through concrete actions we must ensurethat the horrors and uncertainties of the past and thecontinued violations of fundamental human rights are notrepeated in the new millennium. We must deviseappropriate strategies and find ways and means whichwill enable future generations to live in harmony  peaceand development  and which will prevent the recurrenceof the abuses of human dignity that have been witnessedthroughout human history.It is only through such actions that we can ensurethat the motto of “all human rights for all” is fullyrealized. As the Secretary-General once reminded us human rights belong to no Government and are limited tono continent  for they are fundamental to humankinditself.We in Mozambique look forward to the celebrationsas a source of momentum in educating ourselves aboutthe scope and magnitude of human rights andfundamental freedoms  taking into account that thepromotion and protection of these rights is essentiallyeveryone?s responsibility. However  we recognize theprimary responsibility of the State in ensuring theenjoyment of human rights by our citizens. MyGovernment underscores the need to assert the integrated interdependent and indivisible nature of all categories ofrights  in which both political and civil rights  and34economic  social and cultural rights  including the right todevelopment  are treated equally. The programme we haveprepared  which will culminate in a major celebration on 10December  is in conformity with these principles.The establishment in Rome last July of theInternational Criminal Court represents a remarkablecontribution by mankind to the protection and promotion ofhuman rights all over the world. In Rome we created anunprecedented comprehensive legal framework tosafeguard human rights and bring to justice thoseresponsible for the most heinous crimes ever witnessed byhumanity  such as those committed in the recent cases ofRwanda and of the former Yugoslavia.Although we would have liked a Court with morefar-reaching powers  we understand that the presentstatute adopted in Rome represents a very delicate anddifficult compromise achieved through very long andpainful negotiations. Efforts must be made to makepossible the early entry into force of the statute of theCourt. We must also explore all possible avenues offeredby the statute to improve the functioning and competenceof the Court. That course of action would undoubtedlyprovide better acceptance of the statute of the Court andwould ultimately ensure its universality.Our success in tackling the human rights issue sustainable development and conflict resolution as well asin finding consensus on the major issues within theframework of the ongoing process of reform of ourOrganization will greatly depend on the manner in whichwe can accommodate our individual and collectiveinterests. Let us work together to ensure the attainment ofthese objectives  and to enable the United Nations to fulfilits obligations as we enter the new millennium."
"116",4860,"MRT",53,1998,"Allow me first of all  on behalf of my country?sdelegation  to convey to Mr. Opertti my warmcongratulations on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. I amconvinced that his wisdom and experience will ensure thatwe are successful in our work. I wish also to thank hispredecessor  Mr. Udovenko  who guided the work of thelast session so skilfully.I wish also to extend our appreciation to HisExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  for his constant and tireless efforts tostrengthen the universality of the United Nations  toenhance its credibility and to strengthen its ability todischarge its responsibilities despite a difficultinternational situation.On 16 July of last year  the Secretary-Generalpresented to the Assembly his report entitled “Renewingthe United Nations: a Programme for Reform”(A/51/950)  which provides an overall scheme to14modernize the working methods of the Organization inorder to give it fresh impetus and enhance its efficiency sothat it is better capable of responding optimally to thegrowing needs of the international community on thethreshold of the third millennium.In this regard  we are convinced that implementationof the measures to reform the Organization will assist it inachieving its aims and objectives  namely restoring peaceand security to the world and strengthening internationalcooperation in such a way as to achieve the economic andsocial development of all nations and peoples. In line withthis  the question of reform and expansion of the UnitedNations Security Council has  for several years  beendiscussed. In this connection  we would like to reiterate oursupport for the proposals aiming at enlarging therepresentative base of that key body in accordance with thenorms of democracy  transparency and justice and withequitable geographical distribution  enabling it to reflect theuniversal nature of our Organization pursuant to Article 24of the Charter.The threats facing today?s world are not all political ormilitary in nature. Some of them are economic or socialand call for prompt and practical solution. The scourge ofdrugs and psychotropic substances and the ravages resultingfrom their consumption  marketing and distribution areamong the most serious challenges facing us today. In thisconnection  I wish to express my delegation?s satisfactionthat awareness of the dangers inherent in this evil issteadily growing. This has been reflected in a very clear-cutfashion in the unanimous adoption  at the twentieth specialsession of the General Assembly held last June  of thePolitical Declaration and the Guiding Principles of DrugDemand Reduction.There is no doubt that international peace and securityon the one hand and economic growth  social developmentand the eradication of poverty on the other are organicallybound up one with another. The United Nations and itsspecialized agencies have provided many measures toimpress this reality on all of us. This approach has beenmanifested in the adoption of a large number ofprogrammes and recommendations stemming fromimportant international conferences and forums organizedin the last few years under the auspices of the UnitedNations.However  this enormous effort should be translatedinto concrete reality through a new mobilization based onpartnership and solidarity. The first step should be to devoteto these lofty objectives the tremendous resources allocatedto the production  development and acquisition of alltypes of weapons of mass destruction.On this basis  we must likewise enable thedeveloping countries to speed up effectively their pace ofgrowth. To this end  donor countries should augment theirofficial development assistance  increase flows ofinvestments  put an end to the continuous deterioration interms of commercial trade  and give the products ofdeveloping countries free access to their markets withoutany hindrance.Likewise  the debt problem  which constitutes aheavy burden for the economies of developing countries should receive the attention that it deserves. The 1997Human Development Report indicates that debt servicingon average absorbs a fifth of a developing country?sexport earnings  which is a significant drain on its modestforeign currency reserves and thus compromises its abilityto take part in international trade on an equal footing.In this context  we hope that the initiatives taken onthe subject of the external debt of the poorest and mostheavily indebted countries will make it possible to find aradical solution to this set of problems  which impedesthese countries? development endeavours.Despite the magnitude of the challenges ofdevelopment and the wide range of priorities involved and despite an unfavourable world economic situation  theIslamic Republic of Mauritania  under the enlightenedleadership of the President of the Republic  Mr. MaaouyaOuld Sid?Ahmed Taya  has taken significant stepstowards comprehensive development aimed at raising ourcitizens? standard of living and at consolidatingdemocracy and the rule of law in a climate of tranquillity security and stability.On the political plane  therefore  pluralisticdemocracy in our country came to fruition with theholding on 12 December 1997 of pluralistic presidentialelections  the second of their kind  in which severalcandidates participated in a spirit of healthy competitionand a climate of political plurality and freedom ofexpression. Furthermore  the third municipal elections scheduled for the end of this year  are being organizedsuccessfully.Alongside this democratic process  which embodiesour people?s aspirations to fully exercise its rights  ourcountry is engaged in a decisive struggle to eradicatepoverty and to combat illiteracy and marginalization  for15we are convinced that genuine enjoyment of human rightsand fundamental freedoms cannot be fully achieved exceptthrough a sustained effort aimed at enhancing citizens?socio-economic and cultural level.We have created an agency to deal with human rights poverty and integration. That agency is responsible forpromoting the exercise of human rights and implementingthe national strategy to combat poverty. The budgetaryallocations earmarked for social expenditure areapproximately 37 per cent of all public expenditure —almost double the level recommended by the WorldSummit for Social Development.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania is pursuing aforeign policy that is based on immutable principles aimedat fostering relations of good-neighbourliness  peacefulcoexistence and strengthened regional and internationalcooperation. On the basis of these principles  my countryattaches particular importance to the consolidation ofstability and the containment of the large number of areasof tension around the world that are likely to threateninternational peace and security and to jeopardize thedevelopment efforts of many nations and peoples.While reaffirming its full support for the peace processin the Middle East  my country believes that no just andlasting peace can be achieved in that region until Israel haswithdrawn from all the occupied Palestinian territories including Jerusalem  the Syrian Golan and the Lebaneseterritories  in conformity with Security Council resolutions242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and the principle ofland for peace. Such a peace cannot be attained until thePalestinian people have been enabled to establish theirindependent state on their territory with Al-Quds as itscapital.In this respect  my country expresses its profoundconcern at the difficulties besetting the peace process andthe negative developments that have taken place in theregion. My country also calls for taking the measuresnecessary for restarting peace negotiations on all tracks  andurges the two sponsors of the peace process to make furtherefforts to preserve the chances for peace in that region.With respect to the Gulf region  we hope that allregional and international efforts will combine to bringabout a return to stability and concord in the area. In thisrespect my country  while reaffirming its attachment andcommitment to international legitimacy and United Nationsresolutions  reiterates its repudiation of anything that couldundermine the independence of Kuwait and its territorialintegrity.It also reaffirms its consistent position of rejectingany measure likely to threaten the unity of Iraq and theintegrity of its territory. At the same time  it calls for thelifting of the embargo imposed for seven years now onthe Iraqi people. The Iraqis have been very hard hit bythis embargo  whose impact has been first and foremostfelt by women  children and the elderly.With respect to the Arab Maghreb  my country isacting  together with its sister countries of the ArabMaghreb Union  to develop cooperation and consultation to respond to the aspirations of the peoples of theMaghreb.As to Western Sahara  my country expresses itssatisfaction at the positive steps taken within theframework of the United Nations settlement plan andreiterates its readiness to do its utmost to facilitate itsimplementation.We call for the lifting of the embargo imposed onthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We hope that the recentpositive developments will lead to finding a formula fora prompt settlement of this question  which has harmedthe interests of the Libyan people.In many parts of Africa  the situation remainsworrisome because of conflicts and civil wars  with theattendant torrent of human suffering and destruction.These crises  along with other crises around the world should be given more sustained attention by the UnitedNations  since it is the international community that bearsresponsibility for containing them and for acting seriouslyand effectively to prevent their proliferation. Mydelegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-Generalon the causes of conflict in Africa and on ways ofpromoting durable peace and sustainable development.We also welcome Security Council resolution 1170(1998)  adopted last May  which authorizes a number ofmechanisms for the implementation of therecommendations contained in that report. We hope toothat at its present session the General Assembly  whenconsidering that report  will find ways and means ofimplementing the recommendations that fall within itspurview.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania expresses itsconcern at the persistent conflict in Somalia and hopesthat the Somalis will be able to find the path to16constructive dialogue  in order to bring about a settlementthat will secure concord and stability in that country.In the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  wehope that the efforts undertaken by the League of ArabStates and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) willlead to a solution that will preserve that country?ssovereignty and unity.In Guinea-Bissau  my country welcomes the truceagreement signed last 26 August and supports all the effortsand initiatives aimed at restoring security and stability.Similarly  my country urges Ethiopia and Eritrea tocontinue to comply with the ceasefire  in the hope that theefforts undertaken by the OAU will result in a fairsettlement which will guarantee security and stability in theregion.With respect to the Great Lakes region and the seriousdevelopments taking place there  my country supports allendeavours to promote a return to stability and to bringabout the reconstruction of everything that has beendestroyed by war and conflict there.Likewise  my country supports the regional andinternational endeavours to consolidate peace in SierraLeone  so that that country may see the beginning of a newera of peace  stability  reconstruction and development.It is regrettable that there are many other regions ofthe world where there is instability and conflict. In theBalkan region  the situation in Kosovo continues to worsen compounding the suffering of the population and boding illwith regard to future humanitarian disasters comparable tothose experienced in the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina. This calls for decisive internationalintervention to prevent the situation from worsening further.While war and conflict cause mass tragedies and massdestruction  the international community today is facing thephenomenon of terrorism  which cannot be contained withineither time or place and which also threatens the peace andstability of all States and peoples. My country stresses itscondemnation of terrorism in all of its forms  whatever itsorigins. We call for strengthening of cooperation andconsultation at the international level in order to confront itresolutely and severely.The world of today witnesses a gigantic leap in theincrease of wealth  improvement of means of production evolution of telecommunications and the informaticsrevolution. Although the developments offer conditions ofcomfort and well-being  they do  however  widen thechasm which separates the development and growth levelsof the developed and the developing countries. This willexist as long as cooperation  solidarity and partnership donot prevail  until nations and peoples can together benefitfrom the advantages of globalization  and until theinternational community is able to give an impetus tointernational relations based on peace  democracy  justiceand sustainable development."
"117",4906,"MUS",53,1998,"Our presence heretoday is  for my delegation and my country  cause forsome celebration. This is the thirtieth anniversary of ourfirst participation in the General Assembly. Upon theattainment of our independence in 1968  the father of thenation  the then Prime Minister Sir SeewoosagurRamgoolam  addressed the United Nations.I join the speakers before me in congratulatingMr. Opertti on his assumption of the office of Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.I would also like to thank his predecessor Mr. Udovenko  for the manner in which he conducted thework of the previous session.I wish to commend our Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his wise leadership and vision  which havebeen a source of renewed confidence in the future of thisOrganization. We welcome his efforts to lead a reformedand more effective United Nations into the twenty-firstcentury to better carry out our mission of peace development and human rights. We wish to assure him ofour total support in the continuation of the reformprocess.We are alive to the intense debate on the reform ofthe Security Council. We reiterate our position that theSecurity Council should be enlarged and made moredemocratic and representative. In this respect  we reaffirmour commitment to the stand taken by the Non-AlignedMovement at the recent Summit in Durban.In recent years the world has been profoundlytransformed by the powerful forces of globalization andliberalization.All countries are now inextricably linked asdistances between them become increasingly immaterialthrough great leaps in information technology andcommunications.The tremors triggered by the crises of the South-EastAsian economies and  more recently  the turmoil in theworld financial markets have shown in a dramatic waythe dangers of the contagion effect. Even those countrieswhich are trying to be efficient and competitive face thepossibility of external shocks because of the volatility ofcapital markets.7I believe that the world community should devisecreative and effective mechanisms to prevent emergingeconomies which have put in hard work from losing thefruits of liberalization.We must not go back to the inward-looking strategiesof the 1960s. We must continue to open our economies  butwith greater caution.This is a great challenge for a large majority ofnations  particularly the least developed ones. We knowonly too well that a number of developing countries areamong the most vulnerable and are not yet ready tointegrate into the global economy.When I last addressed this Assembly  I dwelled atsome length on the generally grim situation in Africa which remains one of the most intractable challenges to theworld community. It is a continent rich in natural resourcesand yet afflicted by widespread poverty.Peace and development in Africa have been  for morethan a decade  the subject of endless debates andresolutions at the United Nations. But we know thatsustainable development in Africa is conditional upon theachievement of a strife-free continent. It is sad indeed thatyear after year the number of potential flashpoints seems togrow more numerous. The situation in many regions ofAfrica remains a cause for great concern.The peoples of the continent can ill afford thepointless strife and violence visited upon them at a timewhen the priorities should be economic and socialdevelopment.We in Africa naturally have to bear the primaryresponsibility for assuring lasting peace for our peoples.This is precisely what the leaders of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) are striving to achieve.In his statement to this Assembly  on Monday President Nelson Mandela  current Chairman of SADC mentioned the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republicof the Congo. This difficult problem figured prominently onthe agenda of the summit which Mauritius hosted a fewdays ago  after it was addressed earlier by the Victoria Fallsmeeting and the Pretoria special SADC summit.I wish to renew here our appeal to all parties involvedin this conflict to solve their differences peacefully throughpolitical dialogue and diplomacy. In the Indian Oceanregion to our immediate southwest  Mauritius isparticipating fully in the efforts of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) and of the countries of that regionto seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis facing theComoros on account of separatist activities by a group onthe island of Anjouan. Mauritius fully supports the unityand territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of theComoros.Fortunately  however  all is not gloom when wesurvey Africa. We note with satisfaction the continuouspositive economic growth that most sub-Saharan countrieshave enjoyed lately.I had the privilege to participate in a round tabletogether with the Deputy President of South Africa earlierthis year  at the World Economic Forum in Davos  on thenew competitive Africa. The consensus was that Africastands at the threshold of a new era — an era ofopportunity and dynamism. We are at the dawn of anAfrican renaissance.Governments in Africa are becoming increasinglydemocratic and responsive  putting more emphasis oneconomic development  greater openness  market-orientedpolicies and greater economic reform.Regional cooperation is another positive feature ofthe new Africa  working through groupings such asSADC  the Common Market for Eastern and SouthernAfrica (COMESA) and the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) to facilitate cross-bordertrade leading to the ultimate establishment of an AfricanEconomic Community.But for Africa to realize its full potential  severalserious constraints will have to be overcome.The international economic environment should bemade less hostile to Africa. Africa’s shares of world tradeand foreign direct investment still remain at a paltry level.The debt burden has become in itself a cripplingfactor and needs urgently to be alleviated.We also cannot sufficiently emphasize theimportance of official development assistance in thisregard. We therefore deeply deplore the decline in thelevels of official development assistance among the majordonor countries. Today  they stand at a historical low. Weare now  more than ever  far off the target of 0.7 per centof gross national product recommended by this Assembly.This trend must be reversed.8Mauritius took the initiative recently of highlightingthe specificities of small island economies in the context ofthe World Trade Organization (WTO) and the negotiationsof a successor agreement to the Lomé IV Convention. Asa result  recent ministerial declarations adopted by both theWTO and the OAU now contain explicit references to smalleconomies and their high vulnerability. This reality is nowgaining recognition within the Bretton Woods institution.For the reasons I have just mentioned  smalleconomies require time and space to adjust to the newworld trade order. We therefore reiterate the need for themaintenance of non-reciprocal trade regimes until such atime as we are adequately prepared.The Lomé Convention is a model of North-Southcooperation. The proposed United States African Growthand Opportunity Act could become another. Together withthe other members of the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) and the Common Market for Easternand Southern Africa (COMESA)  we would like to reaffirmour total support for its passage.Mauritius has always accorded the highest priority toregionalization to break out of its insularity and enlarge itseconomic base. Mauritius was a major player in launching 15 years ago  the Indian Ocean Commission and  morerecently  the Indian Ocean Rim Association for RegionalCooperation.The Assembly will appreciate that an island State likeMauritius would be interested in the protection of themarine environment. We recommend for the particularattention of the General Assembly the report of theIndependent World Commission on the Oceans  accordingto which the very survival of the human race over the longterm is jeopardized by the abuses to which the world’soceans are subjected.We have to address as a matter of priority the threemost immediate dangers identified by the Commission: theoverexploitation of marine biological resources  thedumping of toxic waste and the harmful effects of globalwarming. While much has been achieved since the RioEarth Summit  we deplore the fact that the initialmomentum and urgency appear to have been lost in sterileand fractious debate. I urge that we address these questions on which our very survival depends  with renewedearnestness and a greater sense of shared responsibility.(spoke in French)In December we will celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the adoption and proclamation by thisAssembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.For us  that will also provide an opportunity to recallanother milestone in the history of human rights: theadoption by the French Constituent Assembly of thedeclaration of the rights of man and of the citizen morethan two centuries ago.At this historic moment  we wish to recall thepreamble of the Charter of our Organization  whichproclaims our“faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignityand worth of the human person  in the equal rightsof men and women and of nations large and small”.We also reaffirm our profound belief in the equalityof all rights — social  economic and cultural  as well ascivil and political. Today  Governments can no longerflout the rights of their citizens without being subjected tothe censure of the international community. Yet millionsof inhabitants of many parts of the world remain deprivedof their fundamental rights by oppressors and tyrants whogovern by force. We have observed with horror theatrocious crimes against the dignity and worth of thehuman being committed during recent conflicts. MyGovernment therefore welcomes the recent adoption inRome of the Statute of the International Criminal Court.(spoke in English)My Government believes that respect for humanrights is but one facet of the indispensable foundation ofthe harmonious development of a country. Democracyand transparent and accountable government  as well aseffective participation by civil society  are the otheressential ingredients for successful development.Considering the complex sociocultural and ethnic mix ofour population  we have taken great care to ensure that allour citizens  regardless of their origins or gender  haveequal access to education  adequate health care  properhousing and employment opportunities. We will soonintroduce in our own National Assembly a protection ofhuman rights bill  which will provide for theestablishment of a National Human Rights Commission.At the continental African level  participants at theThird Conference of African Women Parliamentarians which Mauritius was privileged to host  adopted the PortLouis Declaration  calling for increased politicalcommitment at all levels for the promotion of gender9equality and the empowerment of women. We in Mauritiusare taking legislative measures to translate our commitmentinto practical reality.We have now become even more aware of the need toseek global solutions to our common problems. Climatechange  illicit drug-trafficking and terrorism are problemswhich require a coordinated international approach. Nonation can live under a dome  with its climate isolated fromthe rest of the world. No country can on its own fightinternational drug traffickers or terrorism. We thereforecondemn unequivocally all forms of terrorism and call forenhanced international cooperation to combat and preventits occurrence.While social  economic and trade matters areincreasingly — and with good reason — occupying centrestage in international forums  crucial problems of securityand disarmament continue to retain their capacity to derailour efforts for development.Earlier this year we were reminded of the dangers forhumanity of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and theattendant risks of a new arms race. No country can feelgenuinely secure as long as the threat of nuclear weaponsexists from any quarter. In this respect  we welcome thestand taken by both India and Pakistan in exercising self-restraint. We reiterate our position that any internationalinstrument for the elimination of nuclear arsenals should benon-discriminatory in nature. Security for all will beachieved only when that threat is completely eliminated.Global nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of allweapons of mass destruction must remain our ultimate goal.Finally  as on past occasions  we would like to bringup once more before this Assembly our lasting claim on thesovereignty of two territories which were taken from ourpatrimony: the island of Tromelin and the Chagosarchipelago. We reiterate our call to the former colonialPowers to enter into constructive bilateral dialogue with myGovernment for the early restoration of those territories tothe sovereignty of Mauritius.Regarding the Chagos archipelago  this Assemblyshould also be reminded that some 1 500 inhabitants — theso-called “Illois” — were coerced to leave their homelandto clear the way for a military base. Most of the families who had lived for generations on these islands  were movedto the main island of Mauritius  victims of the thenprevailing cold war. Today  after more than 30 years  theystill experience tremendous difficulties adapting to theirpresent conditions. Many yearn to be resettled on theseislands. As we are about to commemorate the fiftiethanniversary of this century’s seminal document on humanrights  we consider that we owe it to these Illois to fullyre-establish their rights  including the right of return."
"118",4943,"MWI",53,1998,"It was the wish of HisExcellency Mr. Bakili Muluzi  President of the Republic ofMalawi  to come and address the General Assembly inperson  but owing to pressing commitments at home he hasbeen unable to do so. I therefore deliver this statement onhis behalf.Let me join preceding speakers in conveying deepsympathy to the peoples of the Caribbean region and of thesouthern United States with regard to the natural disaster in the form of a hurricane  which has struck them over thepast few days.Let me congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his electionto the presidency of the current session of the GeneralAssembly and to affirm our confidence in his ability toconduct the work of this session successfully. I would likealso to pay a special tribute to his predecessor  Mr.Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine  for the innovative andconstructive manner in which he carried out his taskduring the fifty-second session. His wit and sense ofhumour helped the Assembly accomplish so much duringa very difficult session  which was probably a turning-point in the work of the United Nations. The reforms thatwe agreed upon during the reform Assembly shouldsurely provide the necessary momentum for a moreefficient and effective United Nations.Let me also express my sincere appreciation to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  especially for themanner in which he has shouldered his importantresponsibilities. His outstanding leadership role particularly with regard to United Nations reform  theproblems of my own continent  Africa  and during therecent Iraq crisis has put the United Nations back atcentre stage in its meaningful engagement in internationalaffairs. We encourage the Secretary-General to continuehis good work with the same dynamic spirit so as tobetter adapt the Organization to the current and futureneeds of mankind.Malawi fully supports the reforms that are beingundertaken by the United Nations. We have no doubt thatthey will not only increase the effectiveness andefficiency of our Organization  but also enable it torespond effectively and in a timely manner to newchallenges. I particularly welcome the creation of the postof Deputy Secretary-General. I believe that with this newoffice the United Nations will continue to play a centralrole in promoting economic and social development andenhancing assistance for development  particularly todeveloping countries.The development agenda  focusing on the eradicationof poverty and the provision of basic amenities tohumankind  corresponds to the efforts of the Organizationin the area of peace and security. They indeedcomplement each other.Malawi looks forward to the finalization of theremaining issues on the reform package  includingproposals on the Millennium Assembly  which we fullysupport.This year’s session of the General Assembly comesat a time when we are commemorating the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. We believe it is now time to take stock of theprogress that has been made in the promotion andprotection of human rights since the Universal Declaration21was adopted in 1948 and identify additional ways andmeans to help enhance the promotion and protection ofhuman rights universally.The United Nations machinery for the promotion andprotection of human rights has done an impeccable job inthe past  and Malawi places a lot of trust in it to do evenbetter in the near future  particularly in a reformed UnitedNations where a human rights culture will permeate thesystem as a whole. While recognizing the critical roleplayed by the United Nations in this field  we also believethat Member States hold the key to a world free ofimpunity  a global society where human rights transcend allour apparent divisions.We should therefore not only preach the promotionand protection of human rights but also put into practicewhat we preach and deepen our understanding of thesubject. Since the concept of human rights may not beclearly understood by many sectors of our societies  thesuccess of building a human rights culture across oursocieties will depend on the ability of our Governments andcivil society to provide civic education to the people.In Malawi we have created necessary institutions  suchas the Human Rights Commission  the Law ReformCommission  the Office of the Ombudsman and the Anti-corruption Bureau which  together with various non-governmental organizations  are playing a critical role inenhancing a deeper understanding of human rights as wellas related issues of governance.As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of theadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  ouroptimism about a better future based on the rule of law andrespect for the rights of others has been further fortified bythe adoption last July in Rome of the Statute on theestablishment of the International Criminal Court. Malawifully supports this Court and looks forward to the earlyentry into force of the Statute and the finalization of theoutstanding issues before the Preparatory Commission.However  we pause in our optimism about a betterworld because of certain trends and developments. Malawiis particularly disturbed by the recent wave of terrorist acts.Terrorism is a threat to peace  security and stability  andtherefore cannot be condoned in whatever form ormanifestation. We condemn terrorism and reject thiscowardly phenomenon as a means of resolving disputes misunderstandings or political differences. We believe thatcollectively we should redouble our efforts to deal withterrorism by establishing more measures aimed at its totalelimination. Malawi also strongly condemns the barbaricacts of terrorism that took place during August in Nairobi Kenya; Dar-es-Salaam  Tanzania; Omagh  NorthernIreland; and Cape Town  South Africa.Similarly  we are gravely concerned about theamassing of weapons of mass destruction  includingnuclear weapons  which threaten the future of mankind.Recent tests by some countries confirm our fears. Wecannot place blame on these countries alone  so long asothers possess these weapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) regimesare not an end in themselves. We believe that ourultimate goal should be the complete elimination of allthese dangerous weapons within a specific time frame  soas to guarantee the safety of the world.As we approach the new millennium  it is importantthat all the existing contradictions which hinder theachievement of global peace and security be removed.One way of doing this is to abide by relevantinternational instruments. In this regard  I wish to informthe Assembly that Malawi has recently ratified theChemical Weapons Convention and the Convention onanti-personnel mines. Malawi welcomes the coming intoforce of the Convention on anti-personnel mines. Weappeal to all States which have not yet done so to becomeparties to these instruments without further delay.Malawi has a long-standing history of peace  as wellas social and political stability. In 1994 Malawians optedfor a democratic multi-party system of government whichguarantees fundamental freedoms to every citizen. In thelast four years we have established democratic institutionsthat stand for the rule of law and good governance  aswell as respect for fundamental freedoms such astransparency and accountability. We have managed toachieve these because of the peace and stability that nowprevail in our country. The right to peace is a right thatwe cherish for all. The development that we seek for theworld cannot be realized without security and peace.Within our region Malawi attaches considerableimportance to cooperation with respect to conflictprevention and resolution. The commendable workundertaken through the Organization of African Unity(OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention  Managementand Resolution deserves special mention. Given themagnitude and complexity of the problems to be resolved that body needs increased support from the internationalcommunity to accomplish its laudable goals.22We believe that the best way to resolve disputes orconflicts in order to guarantee durable peace  security andstability is through amicable negotiation and not force.Malawi therefore welcomes the Secretary-General’s reporton Africa and the interest it has generated. We areencouraged by the positive interventions that the UnitedNations has made to date. The debate of the SecurityCouncil last week at Foreign Minister level will only fortifyAfrica’s resolve to galvanize its collective political will.Indeed  Malawi applauds the commitment of theUnited Nations in the maintenance of international peaceand security. Despite all the efforts of the UnitedNations — during which many have lost their lives in theservice of peace — conflicts and factional wars continue invarious parts of the world  causing death  massivedisplacements of populations and floods of refugees andloss of property. Angola  Kosovo  Afghanistan and otherparts of the globe continue to furnish tragic examples of theproblems that beset us.We are disturbed by developments in Angola. Thedelay in the implementation of the Lusaka peace accord andthe non-compliance with various Security Councilresolutions are of grave concern to us. The people ofAngola deserve much better. The ultimate tribute to the lateMr. Alioune Blondin Beye and all the many others thathave died in the quest for peace would be the restoration ofpeace and reconciliation in Angola. We therefore call onUNITA in particular to take all necessary steps to facilitatethe implementation of the remaining issues under theLusaka peace accord in order to give the people of Angolaa chance for peace and security.We are equally concerned with the developments inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. Malawi supports thedecisions taken by the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) at its recent summit meeting inMauritius. Peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congoand the whole Great Lakes region will only make Africarealize its vast potential.In Burundi  the Republic of the Congo  the CentralAfrican Republic  the Comoros and Guinea-Bissau  andbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea  dialogue must prevail in thesearch for solutions to the problems that affect them. Wecall on all parties to give a peaceful resolution of theirproblems a chance in order for them to achieve a lastingsolution. Kosovo and Afghanistan continue to bleed  whilehunger and despair ravage the southern belly of the Sudan and the humanitarian crisis in Somalia continues. Theinternational community can indeed make a difference.In Sierra Leone  we express our relief that thedemocratically elected Government of President AhmadTejan Kabbah has resumed its rightful place. We applaudthe efforts of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) and the OAU in this regard. Wesupport the initiatives that President Kabbah is pursuingas the country starts the long  slow process ofreconstruction and rehabilitation. Malawi welcomes thedevelopments in Nigeria  and we encourage PresidentAbubakar to forge ahead with all the necessary reformstowards the restoration of democratic rule in Nigeria. InWestern Sahara  Malawi is following the developmentswith keen interest. We welcome the Houston accords andlook forward to the referendum later in the year.The overwhelming adoption on 7 July last ofresolution 52/250 on Palestine was a clear manifestationof the international community’s desire to begin a newchapter in the Middle East. As with civilization  peaceand security in the Middle East would no doubt have areverberating effect on developments in world affairs aswe enter into the next century. We call upon Israel andthe Palestinian Authority to bring fresh impetus to theirnegotiations. Malawi welcomes the current initiativesaimed at giving new momentum to the negotiations.Malawi also welcomes the recent developments on thequestion relating to the Lockerbie disaster. We trust thesedevelopments will lead to an early resolution of thematter and therefore an urgent lifting of sanctions againstLibya.One of the major issues for the United Nations is theconcern for national identity. In this century nations havebeen born. Great nations have disintegrated  while othershave found new solutions and come back together. It is inthis spirit of helping the powers of healing that Malawistands to reiterate its conviction that the question of theparticipation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in theactivities of the United Nations on the basis of respect forthe principle of universality and the sovereign equality ofStates deserves consideration. Malawi believes thatappropriate participation by the Republic of China onTaiwan in the international community would be animportant factor for peace  stability and internationalcooperation in that part of the world.Malawi will hold general elections next year. Thisfollows the multiparty elections held in 1994  the first in30 years. During that election  the United DemocraticFront took the reins of power following a free  fair andcredible electoral process. The change that we decidedupon is irreversible  and all necessary measures are being23taken to consolidate the new dispensation. We arecommitted to facilitating the exercise by all of our peopleof their civil and political rights. The Government ofMalawi is committed to holding free and fair presidentialand parliamentary elections.We therefore invite the international community tocome to Malawi and witness the electoral process. At thesame time  we appeal to it  particularly developmentpartners  to help us with logistical  financial and humanresource support. Free and fair elections can be realizedonly through the provision of adequate resources. Weexpect the United Nations to play a critical role in thisoverall effort  which the people of Malawi so desire.Since the multiparty Government was ushered in  ithas striven to increase the pace of economic reform inMalawi. We value economic  social and cultural rights including the right to development  in the same way as wedo civil and political rights. We believe that the privatesector should be the engine of economic growth and thatthe duty of the Government is to create a conduciveenvironment. In this respect  the Government of Malawi hasembarked on a privatization process  disengaging itself fromthe commercially oriented parastatals.Apart from the conducive investment climate obtainingin Malawi  banking and financial services have also beenliberalized. The economic and financial reforms that wehave embarked on can be successfully sustained only ifthey are backed by adequate support from the internationalcommunity  including a favourable international economicclimate.The world trade and financial outlook  however appears hostile for commodity-dependent countries likeMalawi. As we approach the next millennium  the negativeeffects of globalization and liberalization  particularly onweak economies  should be addressed with the necessaryresolve and in a holistic fashion. The persistence of povertyin the world  particularly in Africa  requires the elaborationwithin the various bodies of coherent policies to confrontthe major problems that impede development. Externaldebt  deteriorating terms of trade  difficulties in or lack ofaccess to international markets  declining officialdevelopment assistance and the negative effect of structuraladjustment programmes all form a myriad of issues thatrequire urgent attention.All these issues have to be addressed within thecontext of the need for the rational utilization of the world’snatural resources and the need to protect the environment.The world cannot remain aloof as poverty and despairwreak havoc on many of our people. The many gains thatwe will have made in civil and political rights will haveno meaning at all if the socioeconomic ills that the peopleconfront are not addressed. We are encouraged by thehigh-level dialogue held here recently. What is needed isaction to realize fully the economic  social and culturalrights that we also seek.The founding fathers of this Organization gave us aninstrument which has withstood the test of time. Itremains a relevant instrument. As we prepare for the thirdmillennium  let us operationalize it in partnership for theglobal community  so that we may together triumph oversuffering and despair."
"119",4989,"MYS",53,1998,"Allow me at the outset tocongratulate Mr. Opertti on his election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I amconfident that with his vast experience and diplomatic skillsin the service of his country  Uruguay  he will be able tosteer our deliberations to a fruitful outcome.May I also take this opportunity to express mydelegation’s sincere thanks and appreciation toMr. Udovenko  of Ukraine  for the admirable way in whichhe presided over the last session of the General Assembly.The global situation continues to be in a state offlux. Six years after the end of the cold war  the world isno more the safe place that we were led to believe itwould be. Old conflicts stubbornly persist  while newones have emerged.The picture is no better on the disarmament front.Although the signing of the Convention on landmines isa laudable achievement in the field of conventionalweapons  the situation on the nuclear disarmament frontremains bleak. There has been little or no progress innuclear disarmament. Indeed  the situation has beenaggravated by nuclear tests conducted by two non-signatories of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT) and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT)  posing a grave challenge to thedisarmament process. The international community mustmake every effort to check further erosion of nucleardisarmament regimes  while strengthening and promotinguniversal adherence to them. In this regard  the nuclearPowers have a special responsibility.The situation in the Middle East continues to be asource of grave concern. The dismal lack of progress inefforts to bring the Palestine-Israel peace process back ontrack is a matter of deep disappointment. It portendsadverse implications for international peace and security.Lest the positive achievements of recent years bedissipated  all parties concerned must exert every effort tobuild on the peace agreements that were painstakinglynegotiated. Only their continued active engagement in thepeace process can influence developments in the rightdirection. It should be stressed  however  that peace andstability in the region cannot be attained by delaying andfrustrating the realization of the just aspirations of thePalestinian people to an independent and sovereignhomeland.We are dismayed by the ongoing unresolved conflictin Afghanistan. The contending parties must realize thata long-term solution to the conflict can be reached notthrough military means  but through negotiations leadingto genuine national reconciliation. We call on them to setaside provincial or sectarian interests  eschew violenceand seriously pursue a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the larger interests of their country and their people.We condemn the violence directed at the personnel of theUnited Nations  humanitarian organizations and countriesconcerned.On a slightly more positive note  Malaysia is pleasedabout the successful conclusion of the national elections2in Cambodia  in which the international community onceagain played a constructive role. We urge all politicalparties in Cambodia to close ranks and resolve outstandingproblems through dialogue  in the larger national interestsof Cambodia. The objective should be the early formationof a Government that fully reflects the wish of theCambodian people for national reconciliation  pluralism anddevelopment  and which will enable Cambodia to partakein constructive regional cooperation with its neighbours.Recent events have once again emphasized to theinternational community the continuing threat to peace andsecurity posed by terrorism. Here I refer in particular to theterrorist attacks in Kenya and Tanzania  which resulted inthe tragic deaths and injuries of many innocent people.Malaysia reiterates its condemnation of terrorism in all itsforms and manifestations. Malaysia will join in efforts tocombat terrorism through the strengthening of internationalcooperation in various fields on the basis of the supremacyof the rule of law. There should be increased cooperationamong police and other security and law enforcementagencies of Member States.At the same time  at the political level  theinternational community must work towards inculcating thenew global culture of peace that the Secretary-General hasso eloquently articulated. Malaysia believes that violencebegets violence  and the victims will unfortunately beinnocent civilians. Indeed  in a world armed with nuclearweapons where the danger of nuclear terrorism is everpresent  every effort should be made not only to keepterrorism at bay through enhanced international cooperationbut — and this is equally important — to address the rootcauses. While terrorism may not be entirely eliminated understanding the reasons for its continued existence will bean important step towards combating it.Continued instability in parts of Africa is of majorconcern to our Organization. Malaysia welcomes theincreased attention given to Africa by the United Nationsand its specialized agencies. Malaysia particularly welcomesthe initiative taken by the Security Council to highlight thespecial problems of Africa in the Council earlier this yearand in the Council’s ministerial meeting on African issuesheld last Thursday  24 September. Furthermore  Malaysiawelcomes and will actively participate in a similardiscussion on Africa at this session of the GeneralAssembly. We are convinced that these discussions willcontribute to a greater understanding of the interrelatedproblems of peace  security and development faced bymany African countries. Hopefully  they will lead to morefocused and coordinated programmes of international actionto overcome those problems. Given the continuingdisadvantaged position of Africa  there is a need forsustained efforts on the part of our Organization and itsspecialized agencies  as well as traditional and newpartners of Africa  to assist African countries in theirdevelopment needs. I am pleased to say that Malaysia  forits part  has been able to make a modest contribution inthese efforts through technical cooperation and trade andinvestment in a number of African countries. Malaysiawill continue to do so  within its limited resources  in thespirit of South-South cooperation and solidarity withAfrica.As we grapple with questions of international peaceand security  we should be equally concerned by thecurrent state of the global economy. Indeed  we see thatthe most imminent threat to the well-being of our regiontoday is not political  ideological or military  buteconomic. It is clearly evident that the financial crisis thatdescended on East Asian countries over a year ago hasbrought social misery  political instability and economicturmoil. In certain countries there is now massiveunemployment. Economic growth has been severelycurtailed  and in fact has contracted. Virtually overnight the hard-earned gains of decades of hard work  carefulplanning and prudent management have been wiped out.Millions of people in the region most severely affected bythe crisis find that their place is now below the povertyline. Their right to live a life that is free from the scourgeof poverty and to have a decent standard of living withsome basic necessities has been trampled by themanipulators of the currency markets. Indeed  the super-rich have impoverished the poor. It is ironic that this hashappened in the year when we celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. Though they are pursuing policy responses thatare in line with International Monetary Fundrequirements  the economies of the affected countrieshave not recovered. Instead  the contagious effects of thecrisis have spread to other regions and are affecting theworld economy. We may be sliding towards worldrecession. We may even be on the verge of a globaldepression if urgent steps are not taken throughinternational collaboration and cooperation to halt theslide and reverse the trend.While various factors contributed to the crisis  wehave no doubt that the financial turmoil was triggered byspeculative attacks on the East Asian currencies and theresultant reversal of capital flows. The crisis reveals flawsin the market mechanism and raises questions about therelative benefits of liberalization and globalization. Unless3these flaws are effectively addressed  the threat of a globaldepression as devastating as the one that hit the world inthe 1930s could confront us. The international communityhas to act urgently to reform the international financialsystem to ensure against massive currency attacks manipulations and frequently excessive fluctuations.It has been said that the markets would punish thosecountries which do not possess proper financial structuresand disciplines and which lack transparency. But theinternational financial market itself lacks transparency. Intoday’s financial system  currency valued at more than $1.2trillion is bought and sold every 24 hours. This trade islargely carried out without any clear rules  and the veryGovernments whose currencies are being traded are left tofend for themselves in trying to defend the value of theircurrencies. There is no system of surveillance  no openreporting of any kind and no regulating authority such asthe World Trade Organization for this most lucrative tradein the coveted commodity that is money itself. It is nowmost urgent that the international financial market bereformed. More than that  significant changes should bemade to the international financial architecture.Malaysia has been advocating the need for changeover the last year. Initially  this call went unheeded. InSeptember 1997  our Prime Minister said in Hong Kong “A certain degree of uncertainty is fine  but anabsolutely uncertain financial world is no good foranyone except of course for those who deliberatelycreate the uncertainty.”It is clear that the situation is becoming increasinglyuncertain globally. Increasingly  the experts now agree. Anumber of Governments also agree. The situation hasclearly got out of hand. There has to be change andimprovement in the international financial architecture.There must be rules to encourage greater transparency.Financial operators must abide by certain internationallyaccepted regulations. They must accept closer supervisionso as to distinguish between genuine investors and currencyspeculators. There has to be an earnest effort amongGovernments to immediately engage in dialogues to revampthe system. We must undertake an immediate collectiveeffort to find a comprehensive and workable solution towhat is clearly now a global problem. A few developedcountries cannot resolve this problem on their own. A fewdeveloped countries cannot forever remain rich andprosperous if more than two thirds of the world’s countriesremain poor and socially and politically unstable. This isthe time to enter into a genuine process of North-Southdialogue on an issue of great interest to both. Malaysiawelcomes the call by President Clinton for a specialdiscussion in Washington on the financial and economiccrisis that the world is facing today.Meanwhile  in the absence of reforms orinternationally well-tested formulas or guidelines Malaysia has taken steps to impose currency and capitalcontrols in order to insulate its economy from currencyuncertainties while at the same time continuing to beactive in international trade and to welcome foreigninvestment.While countries In East Asia are doing their best toovercome their problems in their respective ways and toameliorate the plight of their people  it is important thatthe lessons of East Asia be learned by the rest of thedeveloping world. It is equally important that theinternational community find consensus to formulatenecessary ground rules to keep in check the rapaciousnature of financial speculators and manipulators whoseonly motivation is profit-making and profit-taking. ThisAssembly  and in particular the Economic and SocialCouncil  can and should also consider this importantissue. The United Nations can put its moral weight behindthe call for regulating these speculative activities in theinterest of protecting or insulating vulnerable developingeconomies.In an increasingly interdependent and borderlessworld  the globalization of trade and commerce is movingapace. However  many developing countries can barelycope with this  given their weak domestic  economic financial and legal structures. Globalization may bedesirable and  perhaps  inevitable and unstoppable as aprocess and trend. Nevertheless  it is important to realizethat unless the developing countries are given time tobuild up their structures and are actively assisted in theprocess  they will not be able to participate meaningfullyin global free trade  still less compete with their partnersfrom the developed world. In such a situation  globalizedfree trade would be a patently unfair form of world trade with the odds stacked against developing countries.Indeed  it would be a continuing form of exploitation ofthe weak and poor nations by those that are powerful andrich.Needless to say  in the wake of the sad experienceof the East Asian economies  the faith of manydeveloping countries in globalization has been very muchshaken and diminished. Consequently  many developingcountries view the prospect of further liberalizing their4economies with great caution and trepidation. It isMalaysia’s conviction that as we approach the newmillennium  relations among States should be based on anew paradigm predicated not only on equal sovereignty butalso on respect for dignity and mutuality of interests andbenefits. Only on that basis will we be able to reap the fullpotential of globalization through genuine internationaldialogue and cooperation.The enjoyment of human rights is one of the mostimportant principles in the maintenance of justice and peacein the world. The fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights this year affords us anopportunity to reflect on both accomplishments and failuresin realizing the commitments enshrined in the Declaration.The promise in the Declaration to end cruelty and injusticestill remains largely unfulfilled. Similarly  the promise toprovide a decent living to all has been threatened by thenegative effects of globalization and the inadequateattention given to economic  social and cultural rights.This fiftieth anniversary coincides with the review ofthe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. Thereview will provide us with an opportunity to make athorough and honest assessment of the successes andfailures in implementing the commitments made five yearsago. It would be timely for discussions to focus not only onrights but also on obligations. It is imperative that theconferment of rights should be linked to the fulfilment ofobligations and clearly defined duties and responsibilities.The imbalance in emphasis between political and civilrights on the one hand and economic  social and culturalrights on the other has to be clearly addressed in order forthe promotion  protection and enjoyment of all humanrights to be fully achieved.The right to development  recognized as universal inalienable and an integral part of fundamental humanrights  has not been fully realized. There is still no effectiveinternational cooperation to create a true environment ofequitable economic relations which would facilitate therealization of this goal.We may recall that the Secretary-General appropriatelydesignated the last session of this Assembly as the reformAssembly. He tabled his package of reform proposals forour consideration and appropriate action. After muchdebate  many of these proposals were approved and arenow in various stages of implementation. It is hoped thatwith the implementation of the reform package theOrganization will become more action-oriented and morefocused on and responsive to the needs of Member States.Certainly  greater rationalization of the plans and actionsand more effective management will lead to increasedefficiency in programme implementation as well as tobetter and more effective and efficient utilization ofhuman resources.Let us continue to give our strong support to theSecretary-General in his continuing efforts to fully andeffectively implement his reform proposals. Let us alsoextend our support to his efforts to strengthen theOrganization in ways that will benefit all Member States.Certainly  a positive contribution in this regard is toensure our continued financial support to theOrganization  thereby easing its burdens at a time ofincreasing demands being made upon it. Theestablishment of the proposed Revolving Credit Fundmight help ease the financial crisis of the United Nationstemporarily. In the long term  however  the only effectiveway of resolving the problem is through the timelypayment by Member States of their dues.What is most disappointing  however  is the lack ofany progress in an important aspect of the reform of ourOrganization. I refer to the discussions on the reform andrestructuring of the Security Council in the high-levelWorking Group of the General Assembly. IndividualMember States  as well as groups of States  have mademany important proposals on various aspects of thereform and restructuring of the Council  from itsenlargement and composition to its working methods including the use of the veto. Regrettably  all theseproposals aimed at making the Council morerepresentative  democratic  transparent and accountable have not received the desired consensus.Clearly what is lacking is not ideas and proposalsbut the necessary political will on the part of MemberStates  particularly those with strong views on specificaspects of reform of the Council. If the reform andrestructuring of the Council continue to elude us in itssixth year of discussion in the Working Group  we haveonly ourselves to blame for our inability to demonstrateour reasonableness  our goodwill and the necessarycompromises required from all of us to break the currentimpasse. Additional years of continuing with the steriledebate in the Working Group will only increase thecreeping sense of cynicism and pessimism amongMember States  which would be seriously detrimental tothe reform process.As its contribution to the reform debate  Malaysiareiterates its call for a comprehensive reform and5restructuring of the Security Council. We continue toadvocate enlargement of the Council in both categories ofits membership  permanent and non-permanent circumscribing  if not totally abolishing  the use of the vetoand improving the working methods of the Council  whichshould include increased transparency  accountability andparticipation by the larger membership of the Organizationthrough more open debates on issues of importance to theinternational community.As the discussions in the Working Group enter theirsixth year  it is the earnest hope of my delegation that therewill be increased focus  seriousness and urgency on the partof Member States in arriving at a consensus. Otherwise  wewill lose forever the remaining window of opportunity toreform the Council. We should remind ourselves that we donot have the luxury of time and that this opportunity for acomprehensive reform of the Council  if not realized  maynot present itself again for many years to come.In conclusion  let me reiterate Malaysia’s belief in theimportance of these annual debates in the GeneralAssembly and their relevance to our continuing efforts toenhance international cooperation and collaboration at themultilateral level. The statements by Member States in thisAssembly serve to inform us and challenge us to furtheraction in pursuit of our common goals. In the final analysis the future viability of the United Nations will depend on theperception by Member States of the continued relevance ofthe United Nations to them and on their continuing supportfor the Organization."
"120",5016,"NAM",53,1998,"Before I deliver mystatement  let me express on behalf of my country ourheartfelt sympathy to the Governments and peoples of theCaribbean that have fallen victim to the devastatingonslaught of Hurricane Georges. I hope that we all in theinternational community will extend to them comfort andhumanitarian assistance with all deliberate speed.Let me add my voice to the other speakers infelicitating Mr. Opertti upon his unanimous election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.Namibia will readily lend him our full support andcooperation during his tenure of office. Our twocountries â€” Uruguay and Namibia â€” have worked veryclosely together and with other friendly countries inbringing about the African-Latin American initiative  anecessary and timely innovation aimed at concretizing amutually felt need for greater interaction between our twoneighbouring continents. I wish him all the luck.Let me also take this opportunity to congratulate hispredecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  former ForeignMinister of Ukraine  who so ably presided over the work ofthe General Assembly during a period in which theOrganization took bold steps towards institutionaltransformation and in various social and technical fields.Not only did he prove his leadership qualities anddiplomatic skills  but he also  and more importantly  soughtto promote the important role of the General Assemblyitself in the larger context of the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  and particularly thepreservation of human security. For small and developingcountries like Namibia  the Assembly is where democracycomes alive as the worldâs biggest parliament.To the Secretary-General of our Organization Mr. Kofi Annan  my delegation pledges its fullest supportfor his tireless efforts to provide effective leadership andpractical ideas as we try to find workable solutions to thenew challenges facing the global community. His annualreport and the important statement he delivered yesterdayprovided inspiration and reassurance. I congratulate himfor his vision and initiatives.Let me say a word or two about the United Nationsreform process. We are two years away from the newmillennium and  for some time now  we have all beingaddressing some of those challenges that lie ahead andhow the United Nations can transform itself to moreeffectively respond to the needs and aspirations of itsMembers in the twenty-first century. The initial work ofrevitalization of the United Nations in the economic social and development fields has been partiallycompleted. Reform of the United Nations is an ongoingprocess and Namibia believes that an important lesson canbe learnt from what has been achieved so far: no quickfixes  but also no indefinite negotiations. The managementof the global economy is a top priority. Economicdisparities and social backlogs in our societies must bemitigated.Africaâs position on the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil is on the table. It includes two permanent seatson the Council and additional non-permanent seats.Namibia also calls for the abolition of the veto power.We have done so before and I am repeating that call onceagain  for the veto negates the very idea of UnitedNations reform and democratization.Let me also say here that  while we take intoaccount the purposes of the United Nations as stated inArticle 1 of the Charter  it is also important that we takeeffective and collective measures to finance the UnitedNations. In this regard  Namibia urges all Member Statesto pay their contributions in full and on time and to cleartheir arrears in order to enable the Secretary-General tofully carry out the resolutions of the General Assemblyand  indeed  also those of the Security Council.I wish to say a word or two about peace anddevelopment. In 1995  all the world leaders whoconverged on New York for the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations reiterated  in theirdifferent languages yet in unison  their commoncommitment to the highest virtues of human dignity peace and security  sustainable development andprosperity for all. Three years later  it looks everywhereas if it is a question of business as usual. Much moreneeds to be done in the areas of poverty eradication human resource development and gender equality  as wellas transfer of technology and resources for developmentfrom the rich to the poor.27Wherever in this  our one world  economic disparity social injustice  armed conflicts  political instability andindeed environmental degradation prevail  there can be norewarding human existence  meaningful productivity tosustain life and civilization  nor lasting scientific andtechnological breakthroughs in the service of this and futuregenerations.Todayâs very topical questions of democracy  humanrights  good governance and globalization now seem to endup on the back burner of the global agenda. Other prioritiesalways seem to enjoy more attention. Much neededresources are being driven more and more away towardsgreater benefits for the military-industrial enterprises of therich and the powerful nations. The result is furtherimpoverishment of the nations and peoples of the thirdworld.Happily  we have been joined by two illustriouschampions in a worthy human cause: Danny Glover African-American actor activist  and Nadine Gordimer South African Nobel laureate  who will  jointly andindividually  articulate worldwide the plight of the forgottenmasses in the third world  as the United NationsDevelopment Programmeâs Goodwill Ambassadors. Both ofthem are my personal friends  and I congratulate them andheartily welcome them aboard.It has been said by a third world leader that:â€œWe live in an international jungle. There is no lawand order in international relations. There is very littlejustice. The high and the mighty rule everywhere. Theweak and the poor just have to lump it.â€It is hardly possible to dispute this.With regard to issues of multilateral trade that are ofconcern to the developing countries  there is an imperativeneed for us to articulate a specific and constructive Southagenda. The developing countries must develop a commonposition on  for example  whether there should be a newround of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations orwhether a sectoral approach is preferable. These are ourcommon concerns that the Group of 77 should bespearheading in WTO negotiations  as well as in the South-North dialogue.Globalization is here to stay. We welcome it. But it isnot in itself a panacea for ensuring the peopleâs economicrights at home or a just world order  based on cooperationand equity. Globalization must be our thing collectively asmembers of the human family. When one section of thefamily prospers  the rest should be allowed to share inthat bonanza. To condemn a section of the family to aperpetual state of marginalization would be inhuman andunkind.The heavy burden of external debt is denuding theresources and capacity of poor nations  mainly those inAfrica. External debt cannot merely be reorganized. Debtwrite-off is the best and the most humane thing to do under the present circumstances. Some major Westerncreditors have written off debt  others should follow.Bretton Woods institutions should rethink their insistenceon bleeding conditionalities in terms of official capitalflows and debt relief in favour of providing assistancetowards stimulating economic growth and productivitythat will help poverty eradication in the developingcountries. In this connection  it is to be hoped that therecent meeting held in New York with the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be aharbinger of new and better things to come.The Group of 77  which is the task force for themember States of the Non-Aligned Movement  togetherwith our many friends  must continue to work hard inorder to hasten implementation of the Agenda 21Programme of Action in its entirety. For globalization andliberalization to be carried out successfully in pursuit ofour shared ideals of democratization  economic justiceand human security  South-North dialogue should be openand constructive in the spirit of â€œsmartâ€ partnership devoid of confrontation and blackmail.At the 1998 Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) Summit of Heads of State orGovernment  held at Grand Bay  Mauritius  on 13 and 14September  the regional African leaders endorsed policyguidelines that will facilitate the speedy completion ofSADCâs transformation into a dynamic developmentcommunity. This exercise will be carried out on the basisof the review and rationalization of the SADC Programmeof Action. The Summit reaffirmed the ongoing work onsectoral coordination by member States to ensurestreamlining of sectors and increase regional integrationand productivity. The member States were urged toexpedite ratification of the trade protocol as a matter ofthe utmost priority. This will open up greateropportunities for regional economic cooperation and tradebetween them.Added to these actions that have already been takenor are being envisaged was the strong reiteration that all28SADC regional policies and activities must be carried outpursuant to the objectives and goals of the AfricanEconomic Community. The first significant step taken inthis direction was the signing on 25 February 1998  inAddis Ababa  of the Protocol on The Relationship betweenthe African Economic Community and the RegionalEconomic Communities. For 1999  the Summit set a themefor SADC:â€œSADC in the next Millennium: The Challenges andOpportunities of Information Technology.â€That is the vision that seeks to promote the socio-economicempowerment of the people. Political and economic reformsthat have started in Africa must stay on course and producethe results that our people want.Regarding regional conflicts  as other speakers havenoted  the maintenance of international peace and securityis constantly being threatened by ongoing as well as newregional conflicts. Lately  dastardly acts of terrorism andindiscriminate counter-attacks have become frequenthappenings. In Europe  bloody confrontation and humansuffering persist in Bosnia  Albania and Kosovo. In Westand South Asia  a very explosive political  military andnuclear situation is fast developing into an undeclared stateof war and a likely destabilization of that strategic region.We welcome the high-level and face-to-face meetings nowtaking place between some of the leaders from that region.Sadly  there is a serious situation of stalemate reversals and prevarication in the Middle East  and thepeace process has by now  to all intents and purposes reached a precipitous dead end. Israel cannot hope to livein security if the universally accepted principle of land forpeace is not scrupulously adhered to and implementedwithout delay. The legitimate rights of the Palestinianpeople  including the right to self-determination and theestablishment of an independent State of their own  cannotbe sacrificed because of a single-minded insistence onsecurity. An early agreement on a just  comprehensive anddurable peace for the whole of the Middle East is the onlyviable guarantee for peace  stability  security andcooperation in the best interests of one and all. Namibiasupports that approach and not the politics of confrontationand nullification.In our own SADC subregion  some of the old conflictshave gone from bad to worse and new ones have beenignited. In Angola  renewed military attacks and defiance ofthe demands of the United Nations and the rest of theinternational community by Mr. Savimbi and UNITA havederailed the peace process and delayed the finalization ofthe implementation of the remaining aspects of the 1994Lusaka Protocol. The Security Council has reactedforcefully to UNITAâs non-compliance by imposingstringent sanctions on it and  once again  has demandedspeedy and full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol.Furthermore  the last summit of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU)  held in Ouagadougou  was equallyunsparing in its condemnation of Mr. Savimbi andUNITA for unceasing delaying tactics and politicalviolence against innocent Angolans and the unsuspectingcitizens of neighbouring States  including my owncountry  Namibia. The recently concluded SADC Summitresolved  among other things  that measures must be takento ensure compliance by Mr. Savimbi and UNITA withthe decisions that member States have made throughSADC  the OAU and United Nations resolutions.The Summit further called on the internationalcommunity  particularly countries and leaders who havean influence on Mr. Savimbi  to persuade the rebelmovement to rededicate itself to the path of peace andreconstruction in Angola  as a matter of urgency.On another front  the Kingdom of Lesotho is onceagain teetering on the brink of serious destabilization andsocial disorder just because some politicians  who weredefeated in the last general elections  have taken the lawinto their own hands. It has become an acute situation which our regional leaders are urgently and jointly tryingto resolve peacefully.Moreover  other misguided men  driven by a blindambition and appetite for needless confrontation  haveplunged the Democratic Republic of the Congo into adevastating war  which has resulted in inter-Africanfighting on the battlefield of that sister country. Namibiahas joined the other SADC member States  at the expressinvitation of President Laurent Kabila and his legitimateGovernment  for the sole purpose of preventing thecollapse of the State machinery and the violation of thesovereignty and territorial integrity of a fellow SADCmember State by the invading armies and theircollaborators. Namibiaâs involvement is for peace democracy  human rights and regional cooperation.The recent SADC Summit expressed itself on thesituation  and it is important that I quote a few passageswhat it said  as follows:29â€œThe Summit expressed deep regret at the outbreak ofwar in DRC  as a result of attempts by rebels andtheir allies to forcefully remove the Government ofPresident Kabila from power.â€œThe Summit welcomed the initiatives by SADC andits member States intended to assist in the restorationof peace  security and stability in the DRC  inparticular the Victoria Falls and Pretoria initiatives. Inthat regard  the Summit reaffirmed its call for animmediate cessation of hostilities and commended theGovernments of Angola  Namibia and Zimbabwe fortimeously providing troops to assist the Governmentand people of the DRC to defeat the illegal attempt byrebels and their allies to capture the capital city Kinshasa  and other strategic areas. The Summitemphasized the need for all political actor in the DRCto commit themselves to orderly and peacefultransition to multi-party democracy  primarily throughconstructive consultations and negotiations involvingall stakeholders.â€As freedom fighters  we never relied on ethnicity towin victory against the oppressor nor can we ever accepttoday any idea of regional hegemony based on ethnicity andHerrenvolk tendencies from any quarter. African unity andcooperation must be based on a genuine spirit of solidarityand sharing  and not on subversion and disunity.There are some outstanding questions that I would liketo deal with now briefly.Our agenda still has on it the unfinished business of for example  decolonization  conflict resolution andpeacekeeping.The legitimate cause of the Palestinian people  led bythe Palestine Liberation Organization  and their fullenjoyment of the right to self-determination  independenceand sovereignty  cannot end with the creation of anAuthority which is only an interim mechanism. The goalwhich the United Nations  the Non-Aligned Movement andcertainly we in Namibia support  is that of unfetteredstatehood as envisaged in the Charter of the United Nationsand international law. I say this simply to restate our well-known position on the question of Palestine.Cyprus  a fellow Member State of the United Nationsand of the Commonwealth  is being bullied by a bigger andpowerful neighbour which is perpetuating by means of fiatthe unlawful division of that peaceful island State. Namibiais aware of the repeated initiatives of the Secretary-Generalto end the deadlock; so far his efforts have beenunsuccessful. The United Nations and the worldcommunity must not forget the nation of Cyprus and itsheroic people.At last  there is a light at the end of the tunnelconcerning the resolution of the question of WesternSahara. Following the Houston accords brokered byMr. James Baker  former United States Secretary of State there is now an agreement between the parties concernedfor a free and fair referendum to be held in Decemberthis year. With this in mind  Namibia urges theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the UnitedNations to ensure that the deadline is kept and that thepeople themselves are given a genuine choice regardingtheir future. In this way  Africaâs last colonial questionwill be finally resolved and the Kingdom of Morocco willreturn to the fold of the OAU  of which it is a proudfounding member. It will be a happy day for all Africans.Now that the question of East Timor has been putback on the front burner  Namibia lends its full support tothe latest steps that the Secretary-General has taken tofind an amicable and lasting solution  in cooperation withIndonesia  Portugal and the inhabitants of East Timor.We apparently welcomed too hastily what wethought was good news concerning a peaceful settlementof the Lockerbie affair by the application of law. Thegood news has all of a sudden been eclipsed by bad newsor misunderstandings that need to be carefully sorted outin the spirit of give and take among the principal parties.There are clearly serious legal and technical matters thatrequire further consultations and clarifications betweenLibya  on the one hand  and the United Kingdom and theUnited States  on the other. Africaâs well-reasoned andconstructive position on this issue was reinforced at thelast OAU summit  held in Ouagadougou  Burkina Faso.In this connection  the decisions taken there are beingimplemented by African leaders. Among them is arenewed call for the Security Council to lift the punitiveand outdated sanctions imposed on Libya several yearsago. The suffering of innocent people should quickly bebrought to an end.In conclusion  allow me to share a few personalthoughts. In his valedictory address to the GeneralAssembly  President Mandela of South Africa referred tothe connections between the United Nations and SouthAfrica and invoked some memories of the past  beginningin 1946. Those memories and connections also includedmy own country  Namibia  a former colony of apartheid30South Africa and a territory for which the United Nationsassumed direct legal responsibility for 24 years  from 1966until 1990. That special linkage ended on 21 March 1990 the glorious day of our independence. But the long-established relationship between the United Nations familyand the Namibian people continues unabated.During the past more than 26 years of my activeinvolvement in politics and diplomacy  I have known theUnited Nations system as my home. In various incarnations I have walked the heights  the depths and the corridors ofthis magnificent edifice of human brotherhood  liberation equality and justice. Many mentors and friends from acrossthe globe have held my hand in support  encouragementand solidarity. They have contributed enormously to myformation and maturity.I did my undergraduate and postgraduate studies inthis country under a United Nations fellowship. On 25September â€” that is  next Friday â€” I am going to receivean award from the World Association of Former UnitedNations Interns and Fellows for  they tell me  anâ€œoutstanding contribution to the promotion of humanrights  peace and development  especially within thecontext of promoting Namibiaâs nation-building andthe role that United Nations training and othereconomic and technical cooperation activities can stillplayâ€.I am deeply touched by this generous gesture  and Iam immensely grateful. This is the result of my partnershipwith the United Nations and its varied agencies as well aswith friends the world over.I  actively supported by my Government  haveannounced my candidature for the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fourth regular session  in1999. In this connection  I am most delighted to announcefrom this mighty rostrum that in June this year  inOuagadougou  Burkina Faso  the OAU Assembly of Headsof State and Government endorsed me as the sole Africancandidate for the position. I trust that I can count on all theMember States from other regions to cast their votes insupport of my candidature when the time comes. By doingso  you will have made me extremely happy. But  morethan that  you will have endorsed unanimously thecollective wish of the African continent.Lastly  and in this context  I endorse the sentimentsexpressed by our Secretary-General in respect of makingthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly  which fallsin the year 2000  the Millennium Assembly. But I believethe preparations must be made during the fifty-fourthsession  and Africa is ready to lead the way into thetwenty-first century."
"121",5061,"NER",53,1998,"His illustrious election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session gives me thepleasant opportunity to express to Mr. Opertti  on behalf ofthe people and Government of the Niger  our warmestcongratulations. His unanimous election is assuredly alegitimate confirmation both of his personal merits and ofthe firm commitment of his country  Uruguay  to thetriumph of our Organization?s noble ideals.These congratulations I extend to the other membersof the Bureau who help the President in his task  in theachievement of whose success I can guarantee the fullcooperation of the delegation of Niger.I would also like to express my sincere complimentsto the President?s predecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his invaluable work as President.To Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of ourOrganization  I am happy to repeat here the full supportof the Government of Niger for his remarkable activitiesin the service of world peace and the courageous reformwork he is doing in order to allow the United Nations tobetter respond to the challenges of the coming newmillennium. I cannot fail to pay tribute to his outstandingsuccess in finding  through determination and courage  adiplomatic way out of the Iraq crisis at the beginning ofthis year  thus greatly contributing to the safeguarding ofpeace and security in the region and thus to enhancing thecredibility and the prestige of our Organization  as well asto the strengthening of his personal commitment and hisauthority.For more than a half century the United Nations hascarried out one of its main missions by saving us from athird world conflict  which certainly would have beenfatal to humankind. The end of the cold war brought hopeof the emergence of a new international order based ontotal respect for the principles laid down in the UnitedNations Charter and international law  even if that hopeneeds further strengthening  in particular because of thepersistence of violent and murderous conflicts  theincrease of tensions of all kinds and the accumulation ofincreasingly destructive weapons by a growing number ofnations.Africa remains the region of the globe most affectedby conflicts — repeated  disturbing conflicts  genuinesources of instability  of intolerable suffering and ofapocalyptic movements of populations andimpoverishment. That is why the Government of Nigerwelcomed the Security Council initiative to invite theSecretary-General to submit a report to it on the causes ofconflict in Africa and their possible remedies. I wouldlike once again to congratulate the Secretary-General onthe important report (S/1998/318) he submitted  a reportremarkable for its frankness and its realisticrecommendations for assuring durable peace andsustainable development in Africa. It is our earnest hopethat this report will contribute to awakening the humanconscience and bringing the international community to apoint where it will further help the efforts of the Africancountries in their unremitting search for peace andprosperity.6Within the framework of the efforts made in Africa toredress the situation  the people and Government of Nigerwelcome the success this year in defusing numerousconflicts  particularly those in the Central African Republicand Sierra Leone. By personally participating in thefestivities which marked the return to power of Mr. AhmadTejan Kabbah  the democratically elected President ofSierra Leone  I was able to show my Government andpeople?s deep commitment to democratic processes and theestablishment of the rule of law in Africa.This is a good opportunity to pay tribute to thedecisive  beneficial role played by the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) MonitoringGroup (ECOMOG) in the restoration of constitutionallegality and the return of calm to Sierra Leone  therebyimplementing the political will and determination of theECOWAS heads of State. The exemplary intervention ofECOWAS to resolve conflicts in the West Africa subregiontestifies to the opportuneness of giving more responsibilityto subregional and regional organizations in the preventionand management of conflicts. Their unparalleled localknowledge could  when necessary  be given the logisticsupport and expertise of the United Nations to deal withlocal conflicts  in keeping with the prescriptions of theAgenda for Peace of the Secretary-General and with theprovisions of the Charter.Despite major progress achieved in this respect  thehostilities which are troubling several subregions show thatthe goal of peace is far from being achieved on thecontinent.Somalia remains deep in torment  despite laudableefforts by neighbouring countries and the internationalcommunity to promote national reconciliation and therestoration of a normal political and social life.Confrontations and strife are continuing in the GreatLakes region  where instability and insecurity  as well asthe poverty which accompanies massive movements ofpopulations  daily trouble our consciences.Faced with the unremitting recurrence of differencesand disputes which degenerate here and there into armedconflicts  we urge the countries concerned to show restraintand to accede  with the help of the international community to offers of mediation to resolve their differences  inkeeping with the provisions of the Charter of the UnitedNations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  towhich they have freely subscribed.Certain claims relating to identity  as well as theexacerbation of social  cultural or political characteristics often generate violent upheavals  which may rapidly takethe form of terrorism  at times blind and bloody. Facedwith these phenomena  the international community mustunite in efforts to pursue and deepen its thinking and thecollective action initiated a few years ago at the Sharm el-Sheikh summit in Egypt  in order to deal appropriatelywith these problems.In this regard  Niger would like  through me  fromthis lofty rostrum  to reaffirm once again its firmcondemnation of terrorism and any use of violence inrelations between nations  peoples and States. Just as weexplicitly and firmly condemned the cowardly attackscarried out last August against American diplomaticrepresentatives in Dar-es-Salaam  Tanzania  and inNairobi  Kenya  so do we disapprove of the unilateralresort to military force against sovereign States.In this regard  the Government of Niger deplores theattack against the Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory inKhartoum  an attack which took the lives of manyinnocent people and undermined the provision ofpharmaceutical products in several countries of the region.Therefore  it seems necessary to us to consider quicklysending to Khartoum an international mission of inquiry as requested by the Sudanese authorities. We in Nigerbelieve the request to be sincere  having had the privilegeof visiting on 6 May the sites and the pharmaceuticalfactory in question.The Middle East peace process has been at astalemate for more than a year now despite the invaluableefforts of its sponsors to revive it. Therefore it isnecessary to deploy every effort to bring the Governmentof Prime Minister Netanyahu to a point where it willrespect the commitments Israel has solemnly made.The Government and people of Niger would like toreiterate their unswerving support for the cause of thePalestinian people and to reaffirm once again theirconviction that no peace in the Middle East can be justand lasting until the Palestinian people regain theirinalienable rights  including their right to establish anindependent state on their national territory.Of course  peace in the region also means thewithdrawal by Israel from the Syrian Golan and fromsouthern Lebanon. That is why my Government welcomesthe recent General Assembly resolution giving moreprerogatives to the Palestinian representation within the7Assembly. It is our wish that this significant progress leadto the recognition of Palestine as a fully fledged member ofthe community of States.Turning to the question of Jammu and Kashmir  Niger which supports the just struggle of the people of Kashmirto exercise their inalienable right to self-determination deeply wishes that the international community continue togive full attention to this issue.The arms race and the escalation that we have seen inthat area recently strengthens our conviction that we shouldurgently convene a new and fourth special session of theGeneral Assembly on disarmament. Additional progressappears indispensable in the area of the control of weaponsof mass destruction and the establishment of more effectivestandards concerning conventional weapons.The success achieved in banning anti-personnel minesshould encourage us to go farther in order to bring about abetter regulation of small arms and small-calibre weapons.In this case my country welcomes the measures taken tostrengthen the Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmamentin Lomé.For several decades our Organization has been seekingto adopt a coherent approach to effectively meet the majorchallenges of poverty and development  in particular byworking to establish a strengthened world partnership tofinance development. It is time  therefore  to reverse thetrend of reduced official development assistance and to joinour efforts together to increase the scope of that assistanceby revising its modalities. In this respect my countryexpects a great deal from the second Tokyo InternationalConference on African Development  set for October 1998.We expect that Conference to explore new strategies formobilizing official development assistance and to reaffirmthe international community?s commitment to make thedevelopment of Africa one of its priorities.It is indispensable  moreover  resolutely to implementbold policies to relieve and even to forgive the externaldebt of the poorer countries as part of a general agreementto resolve this problem  whose solution is overdue. Thatexternal debt represents an insuperable hindrance to anyeffort to bring about economic growth and humandevelopment in a large number of developing countries  andin particular in the most deprived among them.The marginalization of the African continent iscontinuing  which  in this era of globalization  calls for theestablishment of an international mechanism that is capableof ensuring a more extensive integration of the developingcountries into the world economy.As is well known  my country  Niger  is facingvarious factors that limit its efforts at development:increasingly harsh climatic conditions; food shortages;strong demographic pressure; being landlocked; a drop inthe price of its main export product  uranium; too heavyan external debt; and low investment. All of these thingshave contributed to making us for some time now acountry at the bottom of the ladder in terms of the humandevelopment index.But we have never given up  and my Governmenthas drafted a national programme framework to combatpoverty  proposing as a participatory measure a packageof strategies in the medium term intended to control thisscourge and to stimulate economic growth. Thisprogramme  moreover  is an essential component of ourEconomic Recovery Programme  which was adopted byour National Assembly in July 1997 and which lastMarch in Geneva was the subject of a particularlysuccessful round table.I take this opportunity  since these organizations arepart of the United Nations system  to say here how deeplywe thank not only the Bretton Woods institutions — theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund — butalso the United Nations Development Programme  theUnited Nations Children?s Fund and the United NationsPopulation Fund. These agencies  which often have beenamong the first to perceive the key role that the rightpolitical and social environment plays in creative reformat the national level  have given us the benefit of theirexpertise and their advice and thus contributed to thesuccess of that round table. We are certain that thepromises of contributions they made at that meeting willvery rapidly materialize.At this stage I wish to reaffirm solemnly here in theAssembly and before the entire international communitythat the democratic process is making headway in Nigerand will remain irreversible under my guidance. Thevitality of our democracy is reflected in  inter alia  amulti-party system  with an unhindered opposition  that istirelessly attempting to establish a culture of dialogue andpeace on a permanent basis. But our democracy is alsoreflected in the existence of a totally free private press  acivil society that plays a front-ranking role and anindependent judicial system that is determined to protectthe rights and freedoms that the Constitution guaranteesto citizens.8As part of strengthening the democratic process andconsolidating peace  particular attention is being given tostrengthen intermediate bodies  which are important partnersof civil society — the non-governmental organizations associations and labour unions — so as to allow themeffectively to contribute to the process of creating a moredynamic and conscious political life. My Government isresolutely committed to consolidating these democraticachievements  as evidenced by the holding on 22 Novemberof this year of local elections that will establish a policy ofdecentralization which we have chosen to promote theparticipation of the people in development and also to bringabout good governance in Niger.Similarly  on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  I wish to reaffirmsolemnly that my Government will work tirelessly to doeverything in its power to bring about respect for  and torespect  human rights  based on its conviction that thisrespect is a precondition for the progress of human society.In conclusion  I should like to express the fullconfidence that we have in the United Nations. In our view this irreplaceable institution remains the only forum that canensure the advent of a new world order based on justice fairness  liberty and peace."
"122",5107,"NGA",53,1998,"I bring greetings  Sir  from theGovernment and the people of Nigeria  on whose behalf Iam honoured and privileged to address this fifty-thirdsession of the General Assembly  which is taking placeunder your presidency. Your election to the presidency isan expression of the confidence which Member Statesrepose in you and a measure of our faith in your capacityto bring to bear on the work of the Assembly your wisdom competence and diplomatic skills. I congratulate you mostwarmly on your election and also wish you a verysuccessful tenure.My delegation would also like to pay tribute to yourpredecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine  for theexcellent manner in which he conducted the affairs of thefifty-second session.We also take this opportunity to express ourimmense satisfaction with the way Secretary-General KofiAnnan has steered the affairs of our Organization. Wewish to assure him of our fullest support and cooperationas he leads our Organization into the twenty-first century.The United Nations represents the will of allmankind to collectively seek solutions to the commonproblems facing our world. It demonstrates the ingenuityof the human spirit to assemble the diverse peoples of theworld in a collaborative effort to attain the goals ofinternational peace and security  promotion of socio-economic development  respect for human rights  goodgovernance and rule of law. Our active participation inthe affairs of this Organization since independence in1960 is indicative of our belief in its continued relevanceas a unique institution where all nations — big and small rich and poor  developed and developing — meet on thebasis of equality and mutual respect to harmonize theirinterests and policies for the common good.It is for this reason that we have continued todemonstrate our commitment to work in collaborationwith Member States for the strengthening andrevitalization of the United Nations and its agencies. Wetherefore believe strongly that the issue of reform anddemocratization of the United Nations must be brought tothe front burner. Reform is a continuing process and isconsistent with the rapid changes taking place in ourworld. Our Organization will become irrelevant if it failsto adapt its structures and management style to present-day realities. In this regard  my delegation wishes tocommend Mr. Kofi Annan  our Secretary-General  for hisdedication and steadfast commitment to the cause ofreform  and the generally positive attitude of MemberStates to the critical issues of reform and democratizationof the United Nations.However  we must admit that substantive progresshas been very slow because of the narrow positions whichsome delegations and regional groupings have continuedto take on the fundamental issues of reform anddemocratization of the United Nations. We therefore urgeall Member States to demonstrate urgent political will inthis task of renewing the Organization for the nextmillennium by working out mutually acceptablecompromises that will move the reform process forward.In doing this  we shall be able to build an Organizationwith the capacity and the potential to make our worldsafer and more prosperous.7With regard to the particular issue of the reform anddemocratization of the Security Council — a subject towhich my country  being one of the original sponsors of therelevant resolution  attaches great importance — I amdisheartened to note that no tangible substantive progresshas been made five years after the creation of the Open-ended Working Group on the subject. We note here againthat mistrust and suspicion among States thwarted anyvisible movement towards a successful outcome. Yet thestatus quo is not in the best interest of the generalmembership of the United Nations. Surely  the Councilneeds to be restructured  its membership expanded in boththe permanent and non-permanent categories and itsworking methods  decision-making methods and decision-making processes improved. This is the path towards thedemocratization of the Council  which will thereby enhancethe legitimacy and effectiveness of its decisions on criticalissues of global peace and security.My delegation is also of the strong view that thereform of the Security Council must also touch on theproper relationship between the Council and the GeneralAssembly. The Charter of the United Nations assigns to theSecurity Council primary  but not exclusive  responsibilityfor the maintenance of international peace and security;hence  there is also a role here for the General Assembly.Unfortunately  however  the voice of the General Assembly which is the most democratic organ of the United Nations is often drowned out by that of the Security Council onissues of global peace and security.On the specific issues of the composition and size ofthe Council  my delegation continues to assert that thecurrent anomaly of African non-representation in thepermanent membership category must be corrected as amatter of urgency  as our continent  with its 53 MemberStates  collectively constitutes almost one third of the entiremembership of the United Nations. In this context  thedecision of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) toseek two permanent seats for Africa in a reformed andexpanded Council can simply not be ignored. The demandis legitimate  credible and made with a full sense ofresponsibility and relevance in the international system. Itdeserves the full support of all Member States.It is our deep conviction that a world without theUnited Nations would be inconceivable  especially in thewake of renewed conflicts in several parts of the globe. Inthis regard  it is a matter of concern that Africa accountsfor a disproportionate share of global conflicts  with theirimplications for human suffering and deprivation. The scaleof human tragedies arising from conflicts within and amongAfrican States is alarming. We are pleased to note thatthe Security Council is currently giving specialconsideration to the causes of conflict in our continent with a view to identifying how the internationalcommunity could work in partnership with us to resolvethem. This initiative to focus attention on the need for arenewed and concerted international effort to promotepeace and stability in our continent is clearlyunprecedented and deserves our commendation.Nigeria?s role in the furtherance of the objectives ofthe United Nations  especially in the field of peacekeepingand peace-building  is well known. We have made greatefforts in the promotion of peaceful resolution of conflictsin parts of Africa where innocent lives and property havebeen dangerously at risk. Nigeria has joined hands withlike-minded States to restore law and order. This was thecase in Liberia and  most recently  in Sierra Leone  wherePresident Tejan Kabbah was restored to his position asthe democratically elected President in March this year.This was the first time in the recent history of Africathat a democratically elected regime overthrown by amilitary coup was restored as a result of a collectiveaction in a subregion. As the current Chairman of theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  Nigeria is proud to have provided theleadership within the ECOWAS Monitoring Group(ECOMOG) for the collective subregional efforts whichresulted in that epoch-making event.I should like to take this opportunity to express ourdeep gratitude to the international community for itsoverwhelming support during the crisis  which helped  inno small measure  to demoralize the rebel forces andspeed up the restoration of democracy and the rule of lawin Sierra Leone. The war in Sierra Leone is over; thesame can be said of Liberia  but the threat remains. Wetherefore urge the international community andinternational humanitarian organizations to take an activeinterest in rehabilitation efforts in the two countries. A lotremains to be done there.Currently our subregional grouping  through itsCommittee of Seven  is actively involved in restoringpeace in Guinea-Bissau  where a rebel group took uparms against the elected Government. It joined effortswith like-minded groups and a result a ceasefire wasagreed upon a few weeks ago. We are optimistic that thisagreement will hold.8We have also helped to create within the Organizationof African Unity a continent-wide Mechanism for ConflictPrevention  Management and Resolution. This facilityenjoys wide support. However  it has been unable to live upto the lofty ideals for which it was set up  owing largely toinadequate resources in terms of military hardware andfunding. We invite the international community and otherinterested bodies to support the cause of peace and securityin Africa through the OAU regional and subregionalinstruments for conflict prevention  management andresolution.Nigeria is disturbed by the escalation of terroristactivities in many parts of the world. The recent tragicbombings in Kenya and Tanzania  where some 260innocent lives were lost  have brought home graphically tous all the fact that no country or society is immune fromthe activities of terrorists. We condemn these bombings.Terrorism is one of the most heinous crimes againsthumanity. It constitutes a serious threat to internationalpeace and security. We must enhance internationalcooperation to combat and eliminate it in all itsmanifestations. We must reflect our common concern forthis problem through support for an international conventionon terrorism.My Administration came to the helm in Nigeria lastJune and began its short tenure with a few clear-cutobjectives and policy thrusts. The most important is thedesign and implementation of a transparent  free and all-inclusive programme of transition to civil rule within theshortest time-frame. This decision was welcomed by thepolitical class.Our goal is to return our country to a democraticallyelected civilian government on 29 May 1999. To this end we inaugurated the Independent National ElectoralCommission (INEC) on 11 August 1998  with full powersto organize and manage the various stages of the electoralprocess without pressure or interference from any externalbody or authority. There are no restrictions to the formationof political parties  and several political parties are alreadyseeking registration. The party registration guidelines justissued by INEC emphasize the role of the electorate as theultimate determinant of the existence and success ofpolitical parties. This is democracy par excellence andconfirms the confidence of Nigerians in INEC.Furthermore  the Independent National ElectoralCommission has published the timetable for the variouselections in the Transition Programme  beginning with thelocal government elections in December 1998 andculminating in the presidential elections scheduled for 27February 1999. We are committed to sustaining theindependence  integrity and transparency of INEC. Everystage of the elections may be freely observed byinternational monitors from the United Nations  theCommonwealth and other interested bodies. Thesemeasures will ensure the credibility and integrity of thewhole electoral process. In this regard  we note withsatisfaction that both the United Nations and theCommonwealth have already dispatched assessment teamsto Nigeria to meet with INEC officials with a view toreaching agreement on the modalities and the substanceof cooperation between the Commission and the twoorganizations.The draft constitution presented by the NationalConstitutional Conference in 1995 has now beenpublished and will be ready for wide circulation in duecourse. All comments and views arising from the publicwill be duly presented for consideration prior topromulgation.I am aware that on the question of human rightsobservance  Nigeria has recently been the subject ofinternational attention. It is the objective of myadministration  with the support and understanding of theinternational community  to move Nigeria in the directionof fullest respect for fundamental human rights  goodgovernance  accountability and rule of law. Thiscommitment to human rights has been amplydemonstrated by the release of political detainees  thegranting of pardons to some convicted persons and thewithdrawal of charges against others. The general level ofindividual freedom  in particular freedom of expressionand association  has greatly improved. The cases ofpeople who are being detained and have not beenarraigned before the courts and of a certain class ofpersons already convicted for offences are beingexamined  and appropriate decisions will be taken.Already  the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice ofthe Federation  in conjunction with the Minister ofInternal Affairs and the National Commission on HumanRights of Nigeria  have zoned the country for the purposeof accelerating the decongestion of prisons.We wish to reiterate our call on those Nigerians whoare currently in self-imposed exile to return andparticipate in the political and economic development ofour country. With our quest to improve our socio-economic infrastructure and climate for governance  wewill conduct a census of Nigerian professionals and those9with special talents currently excelling worldwide with aview to harnessing all of the country?s human resources.I have also visited all our military formations toreconfirm the commitment of the armed forces and policeto the democratization programme. The officers and men ofthe Nigerian armed forces and police  like the majority ofour people  yearn for democracy in a united and peacefulcountry. They are overwhelmingly in support of ourdemocratization programme.I stand before this body as the leader of a countrywhich is now fully engaged in a genuine and irreversibleprocess of transition to democracy. Therefore  havinghonoured our commitment to the restoration of thefundamental human rights and freedoms of our people andadvanced the prospects of democratization in Nigeria  wenow call on the Western countries to lift the sanctionswhich some of them have imposed on our country. Today perhaps more than ever before  we require the support andunderstanding of all the friends of Nigeria and theinternational community as a whole to help us in theimplementation of our programmes and policies aimed atuplifting the living standards of our people.In conclusion  a silent but peaceful revolution is takingplace in Nigeria. Our people are determined to ensure thatsustainable democratic governance is established in thecountry. Nigeria is clearly at the threshold of a newbeginning in its domestic political and socio-economicstructure and its foreign relations agenda. This is the time therefore  for the international community to give thenecessary encouragement and support for our endeavours."
"123",5152,"NIC",53,1998,"I would like  beforebeginning my statement  to express my solidarity with thepeoples of the Caribbean nations who during the past fewdays have been victims of hurricane Georges.As well as warmly greeting all representatives  Iwould like to express my very cordial congratulations toMr. Opertti on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly for its fifty-third session. This eminent positionnot only represents well-deserved recognition of hiscapability and experience  but is also a significantdistinction for Latin America.Allow me also to express my appreciation to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his vision andefforts to promote deep reforms of the United Nationssystem. Nicaragua gives its total support to theseimportant initiatives  which are aimed at strengtheningand promoting the Organization?s role in internationalcooperation for sustainable development.With regard to the Security Council  there aregrounds for concern over the postponements and absenceof concrete proposals from the Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation onand Increase in the Membership of the Security Counciland Other Matters Related to the Security Council. Mycountry shares the opinion that resolutions involvingamendments to the Charter must be approved by twothirds of the members of the General Assembly.The globalization of all spheres of life andliberalization of the economy constitute a new challenge.In this connection  we share the view of the Secretary-General  expressed in his annual report  about the need toreorient actions and efforts with a new vision that willhelp countries carry out a satisfactory transition to theglobalized economy  which involves complex andsensitive processes.At the end of the twentieth century  the world isfacing profound changes that require innovative solutionsin order for humanity to move in such a direction thatscience and technology can have a positive effect on thedevelopment of countries. The historic transformation weare living through has frequently increased the inequalitiesbetween countries; we must therefore plan how to reducethese negative effects.In commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  we reaffirm our9commitment to continue to work with all the means at ourdisposal to promote and protect human rights. In Nicaraguawe are moving ahead with the consolidation of peace anddemocracy based on full respect for human rights establishment of the rule of law  respect for the separationof powers and the guarantee of individual liberties. At thesame time  we have taken important steps in order to reachhigher levels of economic development with social equity.My Government is convinced that in order to reapfruits we must plant seeds  human capital being one of thebest investments for integrated and sustainabledevelopment. We have therefore made it a priority to raiselevels of education and extend its reach to all sectors.Likewise  we are redirecting our efforts and resources tomaintain and improve social programmes for the protectionof individuals and families in great poverty. This  togetherwith dealing with unemployment  is our priority.The Government?s social policies require healthy andeffective economic policies that ensure continuity alongwith the necessary impetus for development. In thisconnection  the Government?s general objective is to makeit possible for the private sector to create products and jobswithin a climate of stability  promoted by establishing clear reliable and transparent rules that apply equally toeveryone  as well as through dialogue and agreement  whichare the cornerstones of governability and harmony. In thiscontext  strengthening the integrated system for procuringand administering justice is essential. This includes thesensitive area of security for individuals and their property.The macroeconomic transformations that we haveundertaken include significant reforms in the taxation andfinancial system  as well as important measures to protectthe environment  creating an awareness of the need toutilize rationally our natural wealth. These initiatives havebeen supported by the international community  and in thisconnection it is appropriate to recognize the assistancereceived from the United Nations Development Programmefor many endeavours — especially its support  incoordination with civil society and non-governmentalorganizations  for the National Commission for SustainableDevelopment.Nicaragua hopes that at the next Conference of theParties to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change  to be held in Buenos Aires in Novemberthis year  there will be recognition of the environmentalprotection work done by the developing countries indesignating important expanses of their territories asprotected areas. Likewise  we hope that mechanisms forclean development to facilitate the reduction ofgreenhouse gases will be adopted.At the end of this millennium the battle against theproduction  trafficking in and use of drugs continues to beone of the greatest challenges to humanity. My countryexpresses its satisfaction at the results achieved during thespecial session of the General Assembly devoted to thisimportant subject. Similarly  we are participating activelyin the negotiation and signing of the Inter-AmericanConvention against the Illicit Manufacturing of andTrafficking in Firearms  Ammunition  Explosives  andOther Related Materials  approved on 13 November 1997by the Organization of American States.We consider international terrorism and other formsof organized crime to be terrible scourges of our societies.We condemn all terrorist acts and reassert our convictionthat they require firm and severe responses. We are insolidarity with the victims of these actions and supportevery initiative to increase international cooperation inconfronting these inhuman  cruel and unlawful activitiesthat affect the security of our States.We repeat that the role of my Government is that offacilitator and promoter. We are firm believers in the freemarket economy  with a humanistic sensibility and socialjustice. We believe with the same pragmatic conviction inglobalization and in the broadest and most activeinternational relations  without exception.Globalization is not a panacea per se  although it isan exceptional opportunity if prudent and realisticmeasures are envisaged and taken. These must also beimaginative and audacious  without neglecting thepalliatives that mitigate and cushion the rigours of thefirst phases of adjustment and opening up.There is no doubt that globalization will promoteunity at the international level. Nevertheless  we shouldnot underestimate the whirlwind forces that could causeirreparable internal ruptures should the less-favouredmajority sectors — which are precisely those that demandour priority attention to their urgent vital needs — besacrificed to gain time and avoid difficulties. Moreover the vulnerability to which smaller economies are exposedin the face of crisis — such as that of the financialmarkets currently casting a shadow over the worldeconomy — cannot be avoided.In the first 18 months of my Administration  we havehad the highest rate of economic growth in CentralAmerica: 5 per cent in 1997 and an estimated rate ofslightly over 6 per cent for the current year. Within theseindicators  the increase in the agricultural sector is 60 percent. At the same time  we have created 170 000 newproductive jobs  with a goal of 500 000 contemplated forthe five-year term of 1997-2001 for which I was electedPresident. In 1997  we brought inflation down to an annuallevel of 7 per cent.Our economic policy has received the backing of theinternational community  represented by over 40 countriesand multilateral organizations. After Nicaragua reached anagreement with the International Monetary Fund  inGeneva  Switzerland  in April of this year  on a newprogramme for an enhanced structural adjustment facility(ESAF)  these supporters won us $1.8 billion over the nextthree years. Furthermore  upon the completion of the ESAFprogramme  we would be forgiven up to 80 per cent of thelarge external debt inherited from the past  within theconcessionary programme of the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt Initiative. These signs appear to indicatethat  given the steps we are taking and the enormoussacrifices we are making  the time-frame for our becomingcreditors to these facilities could be shortened.We have turned to the international community calling on it from its highest forum to continue to supportus in our daily and difficult battle to get ahead  leavingbehind a dark past of destruction and violence which wehave been slowly overcoming with the combined efforts ofall  guided by a sincere spirit of reconciliation based onforgiveness and forgetting. The exhausting legacy of thatpast is the burden of a gigantic foreign debt ofapproximately $12.5 billion and a devastated economy which  within the space of a few years  was set backdramatically by more than 50 years. We seek understandingand help to achieve forgiveness of our stifling external debtas soon as possible.We must bear in mind that the United Nations  as asupranational body that coordinates and harmonizes theworld?s efforts in many areas  is the most important andpluralistic forum in which the opinions of all States arefreely expressed and the most important decisions takenwithin the framework of world politics. Nevertheless  wenote once again  with great sadness  the absence of thesister Republic of China  which  as we all know  was afounding Member of the United Nations in 1945.The international community is aware that theRepublic of China respects the principles that govern theUnited Nations Charter  particularly its mission of peaceand broad and generous international cooperation. Thedenial of the right of a people to be recognized andaccorded full and effective participation misrepresents andcontradicts the noble spirit of the universal mission of thisOrganization and constitutes a painful collective violationof the human rights of more than 21 million people.We therefore call once again on the nations of theworld to reconsider resolution 2758 (XXVI)  which sounjustly excludes the Republic of China  with a view torestoring its right to participate in all the activities of theUnited Nations.We are certain  Sir  that under your enlightenedguidance  we will achieve concrete results on the delicatepoints on our agenda that will undoubtedly help ourpeoples and Governments in a very positive and tangibleway to achieve the widest and most satisfactory sharedbenefits."
"124",5199,"NLD",53,1998,"I speak to this Assembly with a sense of deferenceand humility. Deference  because I realize that I amspeaking to the greatest multilateral organization of all timeand from a rostrum where have stood almost all the greatstatesmen since the Second World War.Humility because I was appointed just two months agoto the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs  and so I am anewcomer for most of the delegates. However  this is noway detracts from the pride that I feel regarding mycountry?s long commitment to the United Nations systemand the support that this Organization has enjoyed in theKingdom of the Netherlands.I would also like to add that I feel reassured to realizethat most of what I was going to say to the Assembly hasalready been said in the statement made by the AustrianMinister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the EuropeanUnion.(spoke in English)Article 23 of the United Nations Charter says that theGeneral Assembly shall elect 10 non-permanent membersof the Security Council. More to the point  the Article goeson to say that the Assembly  in doing so  must pay dueregard“in the first instance to the contribution of Membersof the United Nations to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and to the otherpurposes of the Organization”.Well  my country at present is up for election to theSecurity Council. In fact  elections are due to be held inthis very Hall in a few weeks time. And so it seems onlyfair for the Kingdom of the Netherlands  as a candidatefor the Council  to explain where it stands: where itstands on some of the core issues now faced by theUnited Nations family  where its stands on the state ofaffairs in the Organization and where it stands on theOrganization?s future. In other words  what is theelectorate looking at?What the electorate is looking at is what I woulddescribe as a nation responding. Throughout the Kingdompeople hear the wants of the world  the needs of ourneighbours and of people in peril. It is in keeping withthe Dutch character to be penny-pinching but generous tothose in distress  to be demanding but tough on ourselvesas well  to hold strong views but carry a big heart —easily critical  prone to compassion.In much the same manner we look at thisOrganization. We look at the Charter as a true monumentof modern times. We feel a strong commitment tomultilateralism  for reasons of principle and for reasons ofnecessity. We seek to promote the institutions ofworldwide cooperation  with the United Nations at thecore. Together  they span the entire range of humanactivity. We shall go on to give it the best we can offerin the form of ideas and in the form of resources.I would like to demonstrate how seriously we takeour Charter obligations by showing how  over the years we have pursued the purposes of the United Nations  asspelled out by the Charter in Article 1. First  peace andsecurity. It is perhaps the most thankless responsibility theUnited Nations carries. Indeed  the odds areoverwhelming. Since 1945  the number of violentconflicts outstanding has risen from 4 to about 40. Theiraverage length has grown from about two months to anaverage of 14.5 months in 1995. Peace and security iswhere we have learned our lessons the hard way  andmore mistakes are bound to be made. We  the MemberStates  need to shape up.Meanwhile  the Dutch commitment to UnitedNations peacekeeping is borne out by our record. TheNetherlands has taken part in 20 peacekeeping operationsso far  is currently engaged in three of them and is gettingready to join a fourth one. Most recently  some 100 Dutchtroops were stationed in Cyprus  where they arecommitted to keeping the two Cypriot communities atpeace. All in all  some 1 650 Dutch troops are engaged inpeacekeeping and multinational supervision. In fact peacekeeping operations continue to form one of the25principal tasks of our armed forces  and we remain ready toparticipate in up to four different peacekeeping effortssimultaneously at the level of a battalion.Peacekeeping does not stand by itself. There should bea comprehensive response to the need for conflictmanagement. We believe in a continuum betweenprevention  on the one hand  and reconstruction anddevelopment on the other hand. After all  many of theconflicts raging today take place in the developing world.Affluent societies cannot in good conscience walk awayfrom a conflict once the smoke has cleared. Donorcountries cannot turn their backs to the ravages of war andconcentrate on the next CNN headlines. We believe thatemergency aid and political initiatives should be teamedwith longer-term development planning  reconstruction andreconciliation. We believe in building a bridge betweenconflict and development.Another pillar of Dutch foreign policy is our strongdesire to ban weapons of mass destruction. Our objectiveremains strengthening the non-proliferation regime supporting real progress in negotiations on the reduction ofnuclear weapons  and making existing conventions on othermega-weapons effective and more reliable.Still  we are not talking only about mega-weapons.The transfer of small arms is a matter of concern for us aswell. They are piling up fast  most of them illicit. In manycountries they constitute a serious threat to the populationand to national and regional security and even contribute tothe destabilization of States.Landmines are the plague of modern warfare  leavinga disgraceful legacy of the present century to the next one.Once in the ground  they keep. To this day people aremaimed or killed in Ypres  Belgium  by landmines put inplace during the first strategic use of them  over 80 yearsago. Mine clearance and banning anti-personnel landmineshave been pursued with renewed vigour in recent years  andwith due reason.I now turn to the second of the purposes of the UnitedNations: developing friendly relations among nations. Letme point to the manner and measure in which theNetherlands has contributed towards this.By geographical necessity  the Netherlands has alwaysbeen a seafaring nation  a nation of traders. Besides makingus the eighth largest trading nation in the world  it hasmade us an outward-looking people  internationallyoriented. Also  it has made us a multicultural society. Over20 per cent of our population have their origins abroad —in Africa  in Asia  in the Arab world and in the Americas.Over time  we have built up strong relations withcountries of all regions. Two constituent parts of ourKingdom  that is to say the Netherlands Antilles andAruba  are located in the Americas. Our CaribbeanKingdom partners have important political and economicrelations with their regional friends. They are engaged inthe Economic Commission for Latin America and theCaribbean (ECLAC)  in the Organization of AmericanStates (OAS) and in the Caribbean Community(CARICOM).Rightfully  Africa is high on the Netherlands?political and development agendas. We encourage andsupport African countries in establishing peace  stabilityand democracy. We assist African nations in building uptheir mechanism for conflict prevention  management andresolution. We help Africa in strengthening its place inthe world economy — for instance  through the WorldTrade Organization. Dutch aid flows to all countries ofAfrica — last year over $600 million worth.Turning now to Asia  the relations between theNetherlands and a large number of Asian countries goback to the sixteenth century. We are an original memberof the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and thePacific (ESCAP). Naturally  therefore  we have assistedAsian countries that have been hit by the financial crisisand its economic and social effects. We do so throughmultilateral channels and through joint European andAsian initiatives. Overcoming the crisis is important  too for political stability in the region.As regards Central and Eastern Europe  theNetherlands is heavily engaged in assisting countries ofthat region in their transition to market economy anddemocracy. Our involvement is a central feature in ourrelations with all candidates for accession to the EuropeanUnion. In Bosnia and Herzegovina  we are at present thethird most important donor  and we contribute to theStabilization Force and to various organizations engagedin the region.The Netherlands and the Arab world have long-standing economic and cultural ties. The University ofLeyden has traditionally been a leading centre for thestudy of Islam and Arab culture. We have a growingArab community in the Netherlands. We continue to givesubstantial support to the Palestinian people and are a26major donor to the United Nations Relief and WorksAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.The third purpose of the United Nations  as spelt outin Article 1 of the Charter  is by far the most complex. Itsbinding element is the promotion of internationalcooperation  but cooperation in fields that  taken together cover a wide range of human interaction. I would like tohighlight some of them  without  of course  meaning todiminish any of the others. Notably  I will touch ondevelopment cooperation  human rights  and internationallaw.Poverty eradication has been the primary focus ofDutch development aid policy for over a quarter of acentury. The Netherlands  whose aid programme last yearran close to $3 billion  has actively tried to strike a balancein its aid policy between the economy  the environment andthe people. We are pursuing development that issustainable — sustainable not purely in terms of ecologybut in a wider sense: development that addresses basichuman needs  that respects human rights  that builds humancapacities  that is socially responsible and that does notmortgage the choices of future generations.For many years  my country has been more thanfaithful to the international target of 0.7 per cent of grossnational product for development. The Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development average hoversaround 0.25 per cent. The Netherlands stands at a self-imposed 0.8 per cent. In percentage terms  it takes thirdplace among the major donors. In absolute terms  in moneyspent  it has made us the sixth largest donor countryworldwide for 1997.All in all  $750 million from Dutch resources flowedto the United Nations system and to the Bretton Woodsinstitutions in 1997. The new Netherlands Government is astrong believer in multilateral development cooperation. Inits first major policy statement  it pledged that multilateralaid flows  including those to the United Nations system  aregoing to be expanded over the next several years.As the Charter says explicitly  internationalcooperation applies also to promoting and encouragingrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Wehave made no secret of our attachment to the cause ofhuman rights in the past; nor do we intend to hide it in theyears to come. The Netherlands has been an active playerin the Commission on Human Rights since at least 1980 has seen several of its countrymen serve in prominenthuman rights positions  has either drafted or supportedcountless resolutions and has strongly advocated standard-setting and monitoring. It is a topic that enjoys solidsupport in Dutch society and has constituted a clearpolitical imperative for a quarter of a century. MemberStates can count on our toeing the line in the future.Promoting respect for the rule of law at theinternational level has been recognized as part of ourheritage ever since Hugo Grotius  in the early 1600s. Inmodern times  the Netherlands has sought to contribute tothe advancement of international law. Areas where wehave made contributions include human rights  legalcooperation  crime prevention  criminal justice and soforth. Much of the groundwork for the InternationalCriminal Court was done under Dutch chairmanship.If indeed we are to serve on the Security Council what will be our aims in the next two years? Our aim isthe primacy of international law. Our aim is buildingbridges. Our aim is addressing all issues before theCouncil. Our aim is more contact between non-membersand the Council. And our aim is openness andtransparency. In a nutshell  we will be driven by idealism but guided by realism. It is in that spirit that we approachour membership in the Council and  indeed  the future ofthis Organization."
"125",5244,"NOR",53,1998,"This year we arecelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. In our global community the issue of human rights is the concern of us all. For thisreason the Government of Norway welcomes the fact thathuman rights are now being given increased priority inthe work of the United Nations. Adoption by the GeneralAssembly of a declaration on human rights defenders onthe International Human Rights Day  on 10 December would represent proof of our strong commitment in thisfield.Human rights is basically about human dignity â€”about protecting the individual against oppression andexploitation  poverty and injustice  marginalization anddegradation. The struggle for civil and political rights andfor social  economic and cultural rights must be one andthe same struggle. When we address breaches of civil andpolitical rights  we must also address the issues ofdevelopment and poverty.As a new millennium is upon us  one of our mostfundamental challenges is the realization of a humaneworld. This must be more than a vision. It is a moralimperative. All Governments endeavouring to implementand promote respect for human rights in their societiesdeserve our wholehearted support. Democracy transparency and good governance are essential foreconomic growth  sustainable development and politicalstability. Governments that continue to disregard basic30human rights norms deprive their populations not only ofpolitical freedom  but also of improved economicconditions.The pursuit of a humane world requires newapproaches. And new tools. A good example of thisapproach is the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition ofthe Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction  which wasnegotiated in Oslo. With the ratification by Burkina Faso presently chairing the Organization of African Unity(OAU)  as the fortieth country  the Ottawa process has inless than two years produced a binding international legalinstrument which will enter into force early next year. Thishas been made possible by a new diplomacy reachingbeyond relations between States to engage individuals andnon-governmental organizations.Our efforts to rid the world of the scourge of anti-personnel mines must be intensified so that we can reachthe objectives set out in the Ottawa process. Norway hasalready made a commitment of $120 million over a five-year period to mine action programmes  includingassistance to mine victims. We call on other Governmentsto join in this endeavour. The United Nations has a centralrole to play in these efforts.The partnership between Governments  internationalorganizations and civil society demonstrated throughout theOttawa process should be pursued in our new drive torestrict proliferation of small arms and light weapons. Inrecent years it has become evident that small arms are aformidable barrier to ending violent conflicts andconsolidating peace  political stability and reconstruction ofwar-torn societies. We need to intensify and harmonize ourefforts to combat the illegal trade in and proliferation ofsuch arms  which account for most casualties in todayâsconflicts.Norway has committed considerable resources toimmediate action to assist populations in war-torn societies.We support demobilization and arms collection programmesin a number of countries  and we have raised the questionof what role United Nations peacekeeping operations couldplay in these areas. To further strengthen these efforts Norway proposes the establishment of a trust fund tocombat the widespread proliferation and illegal use of smallarms  in particular through the collection and destruction ofsuch weapons at the end of armed conflicts. Norway willpledge 15 million Norwegian kroner (NKr) â€” about $2million â€” to the establishment of such a trust fund andcalls on other countries to follow suit. We propose that theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) becharged with the management of the fund.Norway is gravely concerned by the recentunderground nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. I wouldlike to emphasize the crucial importance of both theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT) for international efforts to prevent theproliferation of nuclear weapons and achieve nucleardisarmament. Therefore  Norway urges all countries tojoin the NPT and the CTBT. We believe the UnitedNations should serve as an important forum forstrengthened dialogue and exchange of information onnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament and that itshould contribute to more transparency and confidence inthese crucial matters.The current world economic crisis clearly illustratesthat we are all part of a single global economy. It alsoillustrates that we are far from fully understanding thepowerful forces of globalization  and even further frombeing able to adequately manage them. The internationalfinancial crisis has led to soaring unemployment plummeting living standards and shattered expectations ofa better life for millions of people.We clearly need a better understanding and bettermanagement of the global economy. My Governmentshares the serious concern expressed by the recent summitmeeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban. Whilethe process of globalization has led to greater economicopportunities for many  a large number of developingcountries are being left even further behind in the wakeof the increasing integration of the world economy.As was pointed out during last weekâs high-level meetingon globalization and development here at the UnitedNations  there is no alternative to multilateral cooperationefforts if we are to maximize the positive effects ofglobalization  while minimizing its negative aspects.While our planet is shrinking  the income gapcontinues to grow â€” between as well as within nations.At the same time  we are experiencing a steep reductionin official development aid from North to South. It is aregrettable fact that the industrialized countries areincreasingly distancing themselves from the agreed UnitedNations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national productfor development purposes.31Developed and developing countries alike are accusingeach other of broken promises and failure to live up to theircommitments. What we need is a new partnership based onresult-oriented policies in developing countries and acommitment on the part of the developed countries to reachthe 0.7 per cent target within an agreed time-frame.Norway  which has been well above this target for decades is actively seeking to counter the growing donor fatigue andintends to further increase its official developmentassistance in the years ahead.Many of our most pressing problems are internationalin nature and global in scope. International crime andterrorism  environmental degradation and the spread ofdisease do not need passports to cross borders. They areglobal problems  requiring global solutions.As the world changes  so must the United Nations. Wehave previously commended the Secretary-General for hisreform agenda. Much has already been done. It is now upto us  the Member States  to promote the reform processthroughout the whole United Nations system.We cannot ask the United Nations to do more andperform better  while at the same time cutting back on itsresources. As a very minimum  all Member States musthonour their legal commitments and pay their dues in full on time and without conditions.For the poorest and most heavily indebted developingcountries  the debt problem represents one of the mainobstacles to development. Urgent action is needed to endthe unsustainable debt burden of these countries. Norwayfor its part will launch a comprehensive national debt reliefstrategy. The strategy will form the basis for our policy forsupporting and strengthening the international debt reliefschemes. It will also contain additional debt reductionmeasures on a bilateral basis which will be applied on topof the reductions made under multilateral operations.No investments yield a higher return than investmentsin basic social services â€” in primary health and education.Since the World Social Summit  Norway has activelyadvocated the 20/20 principle. This calls for a mutualcommitment between developed and developing countriesto allocate 20 per cent of official development assistanceand 20 per cent of national budgets  respectively  to basicsocial programmes. We encourage all countries to adhere tothis target.Economic growth and social development underpinpolitical stability. But political stability and goodgovernance are also prerequisites for sustained economicdevelopment. While the United Nations should retain itsvital role in economic  environmental and social affairs the Organization must also involve itself more extensivelyin conflict prevention  crisis management and peace-building efforts. In two weeksâ time we will becommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of United Nationspeacekeeping operations. The United Nations has provedindispensable for maintaining stability  peace and securityfor millions of people  for which it was awarded theNobel Peace Prize 10 years ago. At this juncture  wepledge our continued support for the United Nationspeacekeeping endeavours. The Organizationâs capacitymust be further enhanced  not least with regard to rapidresponse to armed conflicts.In particular  we wish to honour those who havegiven their lives under the United Nations flag. Theincreasing number of casualties among United Nationspersonnel on missions abroad has made us more aware ofthe security situation for United Nations staff. Today  theGeneva Conventions go a long way in protectinguniformed personnel in combat situations. United Nationspersonnel working to promote and alleviate the sufferingcreated by war are not protected in the same way underinternational law. It is therefore important to improve thesecurity situation of United Nations staff  and we urgemore countries to sign and ratify the Convention on theSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.To further facilitate the United Nations role inpreventing conflicts  Norway took the initiative two yearsago to establish a Trust Fund for Preventive Action. Thisfund has made it possible for the United Nations toundertake preventive missions and diplomatic initiativesit otherwise would not have the resources to carry out.Some countries have made contributions to the fund. Weencourage others to do the same.To enable the Security Council to better fulfil itsprime task of preventing conflict and securinginternational peace  it is important to enhance itslegitimacy while not compromising its efficiency. Weneed to find broad-based solutions which better reflect thepolitical realities of today.Conflict prevention  crisis management and peacebuilding clearly require a coordinated approach. We mustsecure a better unity of purpose and integrate UnitedNations peace-building efforts with those of otherstakeholders. Norway will be taking over thechairmanship of the Organization for Security and32Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 1999  and we aredetermined to further refine the already well establishedworking relationship between the United Nations and theOSCE.Most armed conflicts of today are taking place withinStates. Civilians are increasingly affected  and indeedsingled out as military targets. In this context  the adoptionin Rome a few months ago of the statute establishing anInternational Criminal Court is truly a historic achievement.The existence of a permanent  global institution of this kindwill allow us to address the serious problem of impunityand will significantly enhance deterrence of the mostheinous international crimes. The statute also provides forcredible protection against biased  arbitrary and otherwiseunwarranted prosecutions.We need more  not less  involvement of the UnitedNations and regional organizations to prevent underlyingconflicts from bursting into flames. In Kosovo  we have inthe last few months witnessed an alarming deterioration where the parties seem determined to resolve the conflictby military means. There is an urgent need for a ceasefire access for international humanitarian organizations to allparts of Kosovo and stronger involvement by theinternational community  in order to facilitate a negotiatedpolitical solution.Five years ago the Oslo Accord was signed inWashington  and gave hope for a peaceful future for thepeople of the Middle East. Although progress has beenmade  the peace process is today in serious difficulties.There is  however  no alternative to a negotiated settlement.The responsibility for advancing the peace process lies firstand foremost with the parties themselves. We therefore urgethe parties to do their utmost to build confidence andcooperation and to refrain from all unilateral measures andactions designed to pre-empt the outcome of the final statusnegotiations.Although developments in Latin America in generalhave been positive over the past few years  there are stillsituations that give cause for concern. Every support shouldbe given to the new Government in Colombia in its effortsto end the armed conflict. The international communityshould also give continued support to the implementation ofthe peace accords in Guatemala. Consolidating the peace isas important as ending the war.Norway commends the Secretary-General for hisreport on security and development in Africa. Recentdevelopments are indeed worrying and may threaten thestability and future prospects of large parts of thecontinent. The African nations themselves have the primeresponsibility for ensuring a political climate that isconducive to stability and economic growth.However  the international community must providepolitical support and assist in mediation  peacekeeping humanitarian aid  human rights enhancement demobilization efforts and institution-building. It is vitalthat these activities be coordinated and mutuallysupportive. Here the United Nations must play a leadingrole  in close cooperation with the Organization ofAfrican Unity and the subregional organizations. Wefollow with great interest the ongoing work by theSecurity Council in this respect  and we look forward tothe discussions on the General Assemblyâs follow-up ofthe Secretary-Generalâs report during this session.If we are to meet effectively the many globalproblems facing us  there is no alternative to concertedmultilateral action. We must build a future based oninternational law  where solidarity and socialresponsibility are not confined within national boundaries but stretch across borders and continents. We  asGovernments  must do this in close cooperation with civilsociety  with non-governmental organizations. In all this the United Nations must be at the very centre of ourmultilateral efforts."
"126",5290,"NPL",53,1998,"I wish to recall the late B.P.Koirala  the legendary leader who became the symbol ofdemocracy in Nepal because of his long years ofimprisonment  self-sacrifice and struggle. As the firstelected Prime Minister of Nepal  he stood at this podium38 years ago to this very day and declared that theforeign policy of Nepal would be inspired by the purposesand principles of the United Nations. He said that Nepallooked upon the United Nations as an instrument forpromoting peace and justice among nations. Thosesentiments have always guided Nepal?s internationalrelations.It is my pleasure to extend to you  Sir  the warmcongratulations of my delegation on your election asPresident of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to yourgreat country?s contribution to the work of the UnitedNations and a recognition of your own personalqualifications. Please be assured of the cooperation of mydelegation in your work. I would also like to place onrecord our appreciation to your predecessor Mr. Udovenko  for the wisdom and deftness of touch withwhich he guided the previous session.I would also like to express  on behalf of theGovernment and the people of Nepal  our deep sympathyand condolences to the Governments and the peoples ofBangladesh and China on the massive loss of life andproperty due to the recent devastating floods in those twofriendly neighbouring countries. We also sympathize withthe victims of hurricane Georges.It is heartening to note that this year we arecelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. While we are guided bylofty human rights goals in the international field  we areno less committed to attaining them at the national level.Our commitment to democracy  human rights anduplifting the quality of life of the people is unflinching despite a low level of economic development and theinnumerable constraints  including the problem ofrefugees. It is our firm belief that democracy and4development should reinforce each other. Society can enjoyuninterrupted peace and progress only when the rule of lawand the participation of an entire people in governance anddevelopment are ensured.We are a small nation with a great heritage. Ourtradition has been one of peace  compassion andbrotherhood. We have always striven to promoteunderstanding and goodwill among different nations especially with our neighbours. While retaining our age-oldcultural values  our people have struggled for years andhave made great sacrifices to establish democraticinstitutions and to uphold the principles of human rightsand dignity. In this endeavour we are conscious of thechallenges that we have to face. But we are determined tomake all possible efforts to fulfil the aspirations of ourpeople and  in our limited way  to contribute to theachievement of the noble ideals of this great Organization which provides us with a forum to express our views on theconcerns of mankind.I consider it a privilege and an opportunity to make anappeal to the developed nations to extend support andcooperation in our endeavour to preserve the dignity andhonour of our people and the sovereignty of our nation. Weare determined to face every eventuality to defend thoseideals.Centralized planning has failed to produce desiredresults even after many years. We believe that unlesspeople are mobilized  from the grass roots to the policylevel  the reality on the ground is unlikely to change. Torealize this  institutional and legal changes are necessary.Administrative  financial and political systems have all tobe decentralized. Real power has to be transferred to thepeople. We have taken certain steps in that direction.However  I admit that this is not enough.We are committed to the empowerment of women.But changing gender hierarchies without changing socialand economic hierarchies is not possible  as genderrelations do not operate in a vacuum. It is a fact that genderrelations are related to and influenced by social  economicand political systems. Nevertheless  as a prelude to thepolitical empowerment of Nepali women  20 per cent of theseats in local bodies have been reserved. As a result  36 000women are now in the political hierarchy at the grass-rootslevel. In my opinion  this is a significant breakthrough.The list of problems facing us is endless. We livetoday in an unequal world  where global disparities inwealth and income are rising rapidly  widening the gapbetween the rich and the poor  increasingly dividinghuman societies into one of plenty  luxury and power  onthe one hand  and one of poverty and hardship  on theother. The low level of economic development due to thelack of capital and technology  among other things  ishampering the progress and prosperity of developingcountries. Similarly  the falling prices of primarycommodities  the lack of access to international marketsand the low level of resource flows and the unfavourableinternational economic environment have compounded thedifficulties of the developing countries. The worldwidewave of liberalism in trade and services in the aftermathof World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements hasmoved the international economy to greatercompetitiveness. However  the capacity of the developingcountries to trade needs to be sufficiently enhanced toensure a level playing field.The current financial and economic crisis facingmany countries is affecting even the advanced economiesof the world  not to mention the vulnerable and weakerones. This calls for much-needed reforms in the globalfinancial system.The developing world consists of 85 per cent ofhumanity  more than one third of them in the leastdeveloped countries. One third of the countries in thismost vulnerable category are landlocked  and thisstructural deficiency is the greatest handicap to faircompetition and development. All these countries have avital stake in peace and development. In the shaping of anew global dispensation  each category of nations shouldhave a voice and should receive fair and equal treatment.Sustainable development is not only an economic orecological phenomenon; it also involves participatorygovernance  empowerment of women and promotion ofequity and justice. In a developing country such as Nepal the role and participation of women in the developmentprocess are of great significance because of the multipleresponsibilities of women. In this context  the role of theUnited Nations system in enhancing the participation ofwomen in national development and in creating awarenessof the issues relating to women is laudable.On our march towards a democratic and just society we face many challenges  such as pervasive poverty  massilliteracy  environmental degradation  population explosionand  above all  gender inequality. We believe that manyproblems related to economic development can be moreeffectively tackled through regional and subregionalcooperation among nations. Tremendous opportunities are5available for subregional cooperation in our part of theworld among the countries in the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin. These opportunities include water resourcesdevelopment  flood control  energy supply  forestrymanagement and environmental protection  among otherthings. Development efforts in water resources  forexample  would help irrigate the fertile fields in the plainsof India  improve the waterways so vital for thetransportation sector of Bangladesh and generatehydropower in Nepal to meet the energy needs of theregion as a whole. Such a development strategy may be thekey to the future prosperity of the region.Nearly a quarter of the world?s population continuesto live in extreme poverty. This is largely because ourapproach to development  in which the State plays anoverwhelming role  has given rise to inefficiency andcorruption  and our reliance on unregulated market forceshas led to an increase in inequality across the world. Webelieve there is a need for a third alternative in which thehuman being is at the centre  not the State or market forces;the human being with faith  values  emotions; the humanbeing with dreams and aspirations as a citizen  as a memberof family and as an economic being. This approach takesinto account all the dimensions of the human being andsociety. Changing economic relationships and structurealone is not enough. The individual also has to change. Webelieve that this is what we should be pursuing in thetwenty-first century.I bring the greetings and good wishes of theGovernment and the people of Nepal to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. In a comparatively short periodof time  he has proved his dedication to the task ofmodernizing our Organization and his great diplomatictalent and statesmanship in defusing situations posing a realthreat to international peace and security. In the process ofreform which he has started with his far-reaching packageof proposals  he can count on Nepal?s support.Reform by its very nature is a continuing process. TheUnited Nations and its principal organs  such as theSecurity Council  must adapt to the dynamics of change.However  we  the Member States  have so far failed toarrive at a general agreement to improve the compositionand functioning of the Security Council to better reflect thereality of a vastly expanded membership of theOrganization. The recently concluded summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in South Africa reaffirmed thecollective position of non-aligned countries in this regard.No scheme of reform  however  should underminethe power and authority of the General Assembly  whichis the nearest thing to a world parliament. All the leadersof Nepal who have addressed the Assembly haveunderscored the role and authority of this most democraticand representative organ where each of us has a voice andvote equal to that of a great Power  on any questions orany matters within the scope of the Charter of theOrganization.Sound and secure financing is the basis for goodmanagement of the Organization. We believe that allMember States must fulfil their obligations to make fulland timely payment of their dues.In its primary role in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  peacekeeping has beenand will remain one of the indispensable tools of theUnited Nations. As a troop-contributing country  we arehappy to commemorate 50 years of United Nationspeacekeeping. Over these years  Nepal has contributedmore than 32 000 troops and military and civilian policemonitors to various peacekeeping missions of the UnitedNations around the globe. Many of them have lost livesor limbs in the cause of peace. Nepal has signed a stand-by system agreement with the United Nations. We arecommitted to deploying up to 2 000 troops  includingmedical and engineering units  military observers andheadquarters staff  and 200 police monitors available tobe called at any time by the United Nations  even onshort notice.The recent nuclear tests in South Asia  which cameas a disturbing development  have nevertheless reinforcedour commitment to speeding up the time-bound nucleardisarmament process. We welcome the declarations madeby the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in this Halllast week to facilitate the entry into force of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.My delegation is happy to note that the Secretary-General has recognized that the United Nations RegionalCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and thePacific  known as the Kathmandu Centre  has provided avaluable forum for meetings on regional confidence andsecurity-building measures. As host to the Centre  Nepalwould urge Member States of the Asia-Pacific region toincreasingly avail themselves of the services of theCentre.Problems related to drug abuse and terrorism defyterritorial barriers. As the Prime Minister of Nepal 6Mr. Girija Prasad Koirala  stated at the Durban summit atthe beginning of this month  they add to the intricacies ofcomplex regional and global relations. The terroristbombings in Kenya and Tanzania deserve universalcondemnation. These bombings and the subsequent missilestrikes came as a shock  reinforcing our belief thatconcerted international efforts are essential in this regard.Let me conclude by briefly mentioning the SouthAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) consisting of seven countries of the region representing onefifth of humanity. We are united in a common effort toimprove the quality of life of all our peoples. The recentColombo summit agreed to draw up a SAARC socialcharter to give further dimension to regional cooperation.The seven SAARC countries also finalized a text of aregional convention on combatting the crime of traffickingin women and children for prostitution. The convention willbe signed in Kathmandu at the next SAARC summit. Thiswill be another landmark in regional cooperation in SouthAsia."
"127",5354,"NZL",53,1998,"May I start  Sir  bycongratulating Mr. Opertti on his election as President ofthis great Assembly  and wishing him well as he guidesits deliberations. I was privileged to visit his country Uruguay  earlier this year  and appreciated the warmthand hospitality on that occasion.I would also like to express our thanks to hispredecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  who  withconsiderable commitment  presided over the introductionof many important reform measures during the pastsession.Each year this debate provides an opportunity to takea longer perspective on the United Nations — to lookback and  of course  to look ahead. We haveachievements to acknowledge and challenges for thefuture to consider. In doing so  our view is informed bypresent-day conditions. We are living in very difficulttimes. The economic events that have unfolded over thelast year  initially in Asia  now show signs of having aglobal impact. They will affect developed and developingcountries alike across most regions of the world. Theproblems that face us demand a calm and steady responseif financial troubles are not to spill over into widerinstability. This presents a direct challenge to us all  anda test of the component parts of the multilateral system.This year we mark 50-year milestones in two majorareas of United Nations work  two areas that distinguishthis half-century from earlier times: internationalpeacekeeping and the development of international humanrights law. Both have a part to play in responding to thechallenges of the present day. Both typify the uniquecontribution of the United Nations system. It is in thisglobal setting that universal international norms can beestablished. The international rule of law gives us aframework with which to deal confidently with the7problems that confront us. And it is through collectivesecurity that the countries of the world can work togetherto promote and reinforce peace and stability.New Zealand  as a small country  has from the outsetvalued the opportunities for global debate and collectiveaction provided by the United Nations. We are committedto the strengthening of that system. We believe its effectiveoperation is essential to the well-being of our world.We are  of course  as many are  conscious of thecriticisms that have been levelled at the United Nations inrecent years. Ten years ago the United Nations stock wasvery high. The end of the cold war was seen as heraldinga new age. In 1988 the United Nations peacekeeping forceswere awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At the turn of thedecade there was talk of a new world order.But the world community?s expectations of what couldbe achieved sometimes exceeded Member States? ownpolitical will to deliver. And the United Nations machinery which had grown and expanded to meet world expectations proved too cumbersome — and often very costly — torespond effectively.Euphoria about the United Nations began to give wayto cynicism. One editorial writer this year referred to theUnited Nations as “a busted flush”. But when we take alonger view it is clear that neither euphoria nor cynicism isthe appropriate reaction.Since the end of the cold war the United Nationspeacekeeping machinery has been used as never before.There have been some marked successes and  regrettably some failures. Much has been learned. Future peacekeepingmandates must reflect the lessons learned.The need for the United Nations to be able to carryout its peacekeeping role remains. Its successes point towhat it can achieve. But today fewer troops are wearing theblue beret  and troop-contributing countries do not receivetimely reimbursement.The largest contributor?s arrears in peacekeeping andthe regular budget cast a long shadow over theOrganization. Dues outstanding at present have reachedalarming proportions. This affects all — large nations andsmall nations.We cannot afford to have the capacity of the UnitedNations restricted by this constant budget uncertainty.In my own area of the South Pacific we developeda regional response to a regional problem. I am referringto the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea  anisland which was ravaged by civil war for nine years buthas enjoyed peace for the last 12 months. It was theGovernments of the region that set out to help theGovernment of Papua New Guinea and representatives ofthe Bougainville people to bring this horror to an end.The contributions of Australia  Fiji  Vanuatu  the SolomonIslands and my own country have played a valuable andsignificant role  and there is now growing hope andconfidence on Bougainville — rare commodities foralmost a decade. The Lincoln Agreement  signed inChristchurch  New Zealand  in January  while formalizingthe ceasefire  paved the way also for United Nationsparticipation. We welcomed the United Nations decisionto set up a small political office on the island. Thiscommitment by the United Nations will help strengthenthe peace process there.Today the world faces uncertainty caused by thefinancial turmoil which began in Asia. It is affecting theRussian Federation  is putting many countries in LatinAmerica under pressure and is now touching just abouteverybody. The sudden plunge in investor confidence andthe reversal of developing markets? short capital flows hasdramatically changed economic and social prospects.World economic growth this year will be significantlyreduced.This most serious economic situation in many yearshas the potential to intrude upon all of our lives. We mustcooperate to turn this crisis around. And at the nationallevel we must take the actions required  not just for ourown sakes but in the interests of the broader internationalcommunity. This includes refraining from protectionistreactions  which could only exacerbate it  and pushingahead with liberalization of markets wherever possible.A serious challenge is to ensure that economicinsecurity does not threaten political and social stability.We must resist pressures to take political actions that wewould normally avoid. The best way to achieve this isthrough a collective approach to the problems thatconfront us; to strengthen our multilateral institutions inthe United Nations system and elsewhere and buildconfidence in our joint ability to work through difficulttimes.I was particularly struck by the comments of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on these matters inhis statement on Monday. His characterization of the8crisis — that it is not just financial or economic or socialor political  but all of these things at once — is exactlyright. I thoroughly endorse the Secretary-General?sconclusion that we must address the crisis on all thesefronts.As a forum for debate  and as a body capable oftaking global action  the United Nations  together with itsspecialized agencies  has an important role to play inbuilding capacity and providing social support where it isneeded. Much of what the United Nations has achievedprovides the norms and mechanisms to help us throughdifficult times of the sort we are facing right now. Thechallenge for the Organization is to act decisively to tacklethe problems that have the potential to undermine oursecurity  problems that have their greatest impact onordinary people in developing countries. Now is not thetime to go backwards.Recent tragic events in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaamhave underlined that the fight against terrorism is far fromover. The response to terrorism must be decisive andunequivocal. The international community has a duty toensure that there are no safe havens for terrorist groups.Universal commitment to the network of anti-terroristinstruments must be a fundamental objective of allMembers of this Organization.War crimes and crimes against humanity have seen aresurgence in this last part of the twentieth century. NewZealand supports the work of the ad hoc war crimesTribunals in bringing criminals to justice. But this is notenough. New Zealand has long called for an internationalcriminal court that would have jurisdiction over suchcrimes. We commend the effort of those who  throughmuch hard work  dedication and compromise  enabled theStatute for the International Criminal Court to be adopted.It is our expectation that  with the support of theinternational community  the Court will prove an effectivetool in the fight against those who carry out appallingatrocities.Nowhere is the need for multilateral action moreclearly obvious than in our efforts to halt environmentaldegradation and promote sustainable development.New Zealand is honoured to have our ownEnvironment Minister  the Honourable Simon Upton  chairthe Commission on Sustainable Development for its seventhsession. It is our strong hope that this session will see usadvance Agenda 21  and take further steps towardsachieving the goals set at the Rio Earth Summit six yearsago. It is appropriate that in the United Nations Year ofthe Ocean the session?s themes will include oceans andseas and the review of the Barbados Programme ofAction for the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States in preparation for next year?s specialsession of the General Assembly.The Kyoto Protocol to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change adopted lastDecember was a positive first step in dealing with thisquintessentially global problem. There remain someimportant implementation issues to be resolved. TheFourth Congress of the parties in Buenos Aires willprovide an opportunity to make further progress.Thanks to the commitment of the Secretary-General we now have an Organization that is efficient andeffective. There is more to be done if this greatOrganization is to meet the challenges of the present day:changes that make it possible to redirect efforts from theadministration of the Organization to its front-line workin development and confronting global problems.New Zealand looks forward to continuing thedialogue on financing for development. Through ourcurrent membership of the Economic and Social Councilwe have followed closely the evolving debate on this veryimportant issue. We very much welcome the initiativestaken by the Organization towards closer linkages withthe Bretton Woods Institutions. Those institutions arethemselves at the forefront of the effort to tackle thepresent economic crisis  probably the greatest challengethey have ever had. However  we must decide whether intheir present form they are appropriate for the twenty-firstcentury.This Organization  too  like any other  needs torespond to changing circumstances  and be flexibleenough to meet new challenges. It must reflect the worldof today  not stay fixed in the patterns of earlier times.The East-West conflict is well behind us. We now needto address anew the divide between North and South. TheUnited Nations development role is crucial. Once again Ibelieve the Secretary-General hit the nail on the headwhen he described in his statement on Monday the needto restore development to its proper place in globaleconomic strategy. Also essential are measures to free uptrade and investment flows  and promote access toinformation and technology. All of these are tools withwhich to fight the economic downturn which isconfronting us.9The United Nations clearly has the leading role to playin development. Other international institutions play acomplementary part. I am personally conscious of theparticular contribution made by the Commonwealth throughthe recent Commonwealth Small States Mission. ThatMission highlighted the special vulnerability of smallStates  which has led to the establishment of theCommonwealth/World Bank task force on the issue whichwill have relevance to the work of the Economic and SocialCouncil and the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) on the question of vulnerability.Within the United Nations we need to correct theNorth-South imbalance to which I referred through reformof the Security Council. More equitable representation onthe Council would better reflect the world as it is andtoday?s United Nations. Expansion is proving a complexissue  but there has been some good progress this year inthe equally important area of reforming the Council?sworking methods. Altogether  these are matters whichrequire careful consideration and negotiation. Settingartificial deadlines ahead of general agreement on a reformpackage would not be helpful and could in fact provedamaging to the Organization. Any reforms must enjoy thesupport of the greatest possible number of Member States.I should add that regional groups in the UnitedNations still reflect an earlier era. New Zealand is certainlyopen to new ideas on how groupings can be reorganized tocreate a more equitable distribution of electoralopportunities and to recognize modern-day political andeconomic linkages.In the field of disarmament and arms control  it istimely to consider how far we have come and what wehave achieved. The adoption of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 certainly promised the endof nuclear testing. But the global non-proliferation normwas shattered by the nuclear testing in South Asia  raisinggrave fears of a potential arms race. New Zealand has takensome encouragement from statements made in this Hall inrecent days  and hopes that 1999 will be the year in whichall countries that have not yet done so will sign upunconditionally to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty.The Conference on Disarmament has now agreed toproceed with negotiations on a fissile material cut-offtreaty. New Zealand wants to see those negotiationsconcluded as soon as possible. There must be no steppingback from the objective of complete disarmament  includingthe elimination of nuclear weapons. New Zealand?scommitment to this objective was reiterated in thedeclaration which I  together with the Foreign Ministersof seven other countries  issued on 9 June. New Zealandis now working with those countries on a draft resolutionbased on the concerns outlined in the declaration.One achievement which I personally see as a toppriority for 1999 is the conclusion of a verificationprotocol to the Convention on the Prohibition of theDevelopment  Production and Stockpiling ofBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and onTheir Destruction. Following a very successful initiativefrom Australia  I was pleased to chair a group ofministers who this week issued a statement urgingGovernments to commit themselves to completing thistask.New Zealand supports the actions of the UnitedNations to ensure the elimination of Iraq?s stockpiles ofweapons of mass destruction and the threat they pose tothe security of the region. We urge the Government ofIraq to resume cooperation with the United NationsSpecial Commission so that the elimination of thesedreadful weapons can be confirmed. Then the SecurityCouncil can once more address the question of liftingsanctions.In the 50 years since Member States adopted theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  the significanceof the Declaration has been demonstrated time and timeagain. Yet there remains much to be done before thevision in the Charter and in the Declaration can berealized for all. We are confident that  under theleadership of the High Commissioner for Human Rights we will continue to make good progress towards therealization of that vision.The United Nations can add value in promoting andprotecting fundamental human rights standards emphasizing practical capacity-building efforts. We havebeen supporting the High Commissioner?s efforts in thisarea  and we will continue to do so.We see countries in all regions of the world seekingthe international community?s support as they buildstructures to provide good governance and deliver hopeand greater well-being to their people. In particular  I amencouraged by developments in Nigeria and in SierraLeone in this regard.As the last 50 years have demonstrated  thisOrganization has added a whole new dimension to10cooperation among nations. No lesser body could haveachieved so much. In the longer perspective of history itwill be the dramatic development of the international ruleof law and the evolution of collective approaches tosecurity  both political and economic  which willcharacterize our era. In other words  that really is the workof the United Nations.Now  with the challenge of the economic problemsthat face us  we nations of the world are more dependentthan ever on solving our shared problems together. NewZealand therefore rededicates itself to the United Nationsand to the ideals that this Organization stands for."
"128",5399,"OMN",53,1998,"May I begin by congratulating the President on hiselection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session. His election to this distinguished postis a testament to the international community’sappreciation of the effective contribution to internationalaffairs made by his country  Uruguay  with which theSultanate of Oman enjoys good relations of friendship andcooperation. We are confident that under his leadershipand considerable diplomatic experience our deliberationshere will be crowned with success. My delegation standsready to cooperate with him fully in order to achieve allthe aims envisaged by this session.May I also take this opportunity to express sincerethanks to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of friendly Ukraine forthe exemplary and constructive manner with which hesteered the work of the previous session. I would also liketo confirm my country’s unwavering support for thesustained and dedicated work done by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  to enhance and reinvigorate therole of the United Nations and to restructure its principalbodies.9It has now been over half a century since theestablishment of the United Nations  during which time ithas handled a significant number of international issues.However  the United Nations often remains unable toresolve many regional crises which have erupted since theend of the cold war. In spite of the attention paid to theseissues by the international community  the majority of thoseincluded in our agenda have remained without effectivesolutions. It is our view that this is due to the failure andlack of resolve on the part of Member States to utilize themechanisms of the United Nations which were establishedon the basis of the Charter.If this is the case today  how will the future be  whenwe shall be expected to face more conflicts which may bedifferent in nature and size as compared to old conflicts?We cannot address them in the conventional way. We shallhave to examine their root causes and address theirmanifestations and give full support to the Organization inorder to find the means to develop adequate bases foraddressing them so as to protect the internationalcommunity against their recurrence.The high-level working group of the GeneralAssembly made progress in the area of restructuring andstreamlining some of the main organs of the UnitedNations  in particular with regard to the question of reformand increase in the membership of the Security Council.The setback which the Open-ended Working Group on thisquestion faced during the previous General Assemblysession should not stand in the way of achieving furtherprogress. We should not accept retreat from what hasalready been accomplished. We have to encourage theWorking Group to redouble its efforts to complete thescope of the needed reforms of the United Nations in amanner that will meet the aspirations of the internationalcommunity on the basis of comprehensiveness and equalityamong all States  which in turn will contribute balance andtransparency to the methods of work of the SecurityCouncil. This will be a contribution to the decision-makingprocess and to the clarity of vision with regard to theemerging developments in our contemporary world inwhich justice  security and peace should prevail.In this way  all Member States  large and small  wouldbe enabled to participate in the resolution of internationalproblems  especially those which have a direct impact ontheir own interests  in an appropriate and just manner.The greatest danger facing the Members of the UnitedNations in the post-cold-war era is represented by some ofthe unhealthy situations which lead to nearly worldwideeconomic stagnation and the spread of terrorism andethnic wars  as I have just indicated. This wouldjeopardize all the achievements made by humankind inthe scientific and technological fields  as well as withregard to the standards of social and economicdevelopment  and would lead to an historic era withnegative consequences for the future.The disturbing economic situation in East Asia sincethe beginning of the financial crisis in the middle of 1997has generated instability and created political and socialupheavals in the region. In spite of the reform measuresfor economic stability by the concerned States in Asia with the help of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)and the World Bank  the success in restoring stability tothe world economy was limited. In fact  we have begunto witness the repercussions of those measures on othereconomies which were previously immune from them.This is due to the fact that the efforts made were notcoherent and did not address the urgent need to take acomprehensive view of the whole crisis  within anequitable international context.The events that I have outlined emphasize the needfor collaborative efforts with a view to the establishmentof a fair and equitable global economic system that wouldcover all goods  technologies and services. We believethat this should be linked to a new system of internationalfinancial markets which would be more transparent andefficient and thus responsive and adaptable to thechanging financial conditions in the world markets. WhileI am not in a position to give concrete proposals here  wedo feel that this session provides an appropriateopportunity for scrutinizing the global economic situationand for examining all problems and complicationsworldwide  thereby avoiding more problematic impactsfrom which the international community should be saved.This imposes on us the need to work harder  and worktogether  to face the challenges before us in order torestore confidence and return stability and normal growthto the global economy.We strongly condemn the terrorist bombing attackson the United States embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam  as well as the bombing incident in Cape Town South Africa. We also deplore the assassination of theIranian diplomats in Afghanistan. This wave ofinternational terrorism and its rapid growth in an ugly anddestructive form puts us all in a position of responsibilitywhere we must work together to secure peace  tranquillityand stability  and employ all the measures that arenecessary to the success of our endeavours in combating10terrorism. We believe that the measures which are nownecessary to ensure that the perpetrators of those crimesand those who advocate their commission are brought tojustice under the auspices of the United Nations. In thisregard  we support the proposal made by the Arab Republicof Egypt and endorsed by the twelfth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held at Durban  South Africa  at thebeginning of this month  to convene an internationalconference under the auspices of the United Nations inorder to work out common arrangements that would expressthe reaction of the international community to thephenomenon of terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations.We feel deep regret at the growing situation of famineamong nations  which points out the inability of thosecountries to grow their natural resources owing to thefailure of the developed countries to understand the realneed for helping these people evolve the frameworksneeded to operate and activate their nationalinstrumentalities and to benefit from every assistance givento them. Since a number of United Nations agencies  suchas United Nations Development Programme  have becomeunable to continue offering their expertise due to theshortage of financial resources  several developing countrieswere affected to the point that the implementation ofimportant economic programmes in those countries hasbeen seriously impeded.In other regions  ethnic conflicts have threatened toreturn the human family to the rule of the jungle and thelegitimation of minority rule as based on injustice oppression and a one-man rule  instead of the resort tointernational law  which is based on justice and equality ofrights and common interests. If we look at the root causes we find that most of the wealth is controlled by a fewGovernments. This factor is behind the ethnic  political andsocial conflicts which give rise to all forms of violence andterrorism.Only 14 months separate us from the next millennium.We had hoped that humankind would celebrate this historicoccasion in an atmosphere of political and economicstability  free from violence  terrorism  poverty and “ethniccleansing”. Thus  we should intensify our efforts to fightterrorism and violence in a framework of coordinatedinternational efforts aimed at eradicating these unsettlingphenomena  and to ensure that the perpetrators andadvocates of such crimes are brought before the courts ofjustice.In this context  the Middle East continues to face avery serious political crisis as a result of the stalemate inthe peaceful negotiations between the Arab countries andthe Israelis under the sponsorship of the United States ofAmerica.The political stagnation caused by the IsraeliGovernment and its non-compliance with the agreementsthat followed the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference underworld sponsorship which led to the historic Oslo accord and other agreements between the Government of Israeland the Palestinian National Authority have  in our view thwarted world and regional efforts aimed at therestructuring of the Middle East region on the basis of ajust and comprehensive peace leading to confidence-building and to hope for peaceful coexistence between theArabs and the people of Israel.We cannot but wonder where we stand in relation tothis goal. The Israeli Government’s plans aim atcontrolling the Arab lands occupied since 1967. TheseIsraeli policies have hindered the concerted andintensified efforts exerted by the United States as a co-sponsor of the peace process. In addition  this has causedan atmosphere of suspicion to prevail among the ArabStates as regards the genuine desire of the IsraeliGovernment for peaceful coexistence and cooperationwith the Arabs.The United Nations has been continuously discussingthis issue since 1948 and has adopted many GeneralAssembly and Security Council resolutions. Israel has notrespected or implemented any of these resolutions  evenonce. These resolutions include Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which wereadopted following the wars of 1967 and 1973. Israel hasrefused to implement these resolutions through the UnitedNations  insisting on unilateral negotiations outside theUnited Nations. The Arab countries responded positivelyand seriously to the calls for peace from various States byparticipating in the Madrid Peace Conference. The Arabcountries have responded fully and positively to buildinga society based on peace in the Middle East. Despite allof this  the Israeli Government now refuses this proposaland continues to occupy and confiscate land in the WestBank.Is it justice that the world daily witnesses theexpulsion of Palestinian citizens from their homes  thedemolishing of their homes and the confiscation of theirland? Is it justifiable for us to sit and witness the repeatedviolation by the Israeli authorities of the rights and11integrity of the Palestinians through the occupation and thesiege of their towns and villages? Where is the just peacethat we are talking about when the Israeli Governmentcontinues to build new and illegal settlements on Palestinianlands  while the Palestinians themselves are being preventedfrom building or even repairing their own homes?These measures are nothing but grave injustice. Canthe United Nations condone such practices? Can the peacesponsors accept that? Where is the respect for human rightsin the face of this denial of Palestinian rights when we arecelebrating this year the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights?It is incumbent on all peace-loving nations which callfor the implementation of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights to stand by the Palestinian cause and toreject the policies of the Israeli Government  which persistsin trampling over the dignity of the Palestinian people.The establishment of peace in the Middle East requiresthe use of every convincing measure in order to make Israelaccept and implement its legal and international obligationstowards the Palestinian Authority  including withdrawalfrom the West Bank in accordance with the Oslo Washington and Cairo accords. Israel also must resumenegotiations with the Syrian Government from the pointwhere they ended  with the ultimate goal of signing a peacetreaty that will secure the withdrawal of Israeli forces fromthe occupied Syrian territories to the line of 4 June 1967 as well as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southernLebanon and the western Bekaa  in accordance withresolutions 425 (1978) and 427 (1978).We believe that these are the necessary conditions forpeace to prevail in the Middle East. They will also providethe legitimate necessary guarantees for Israel and foster anatmosphere of confidence among the Arab and the Israelipeoples.The Arab countries cannot accept the continued Israelipolicy aimed at the Judaization of Arab Jerusalem  and theyconsider any change in the demographic composition of theArab city of Jerusalem and the expansion of Israelisettlements in the occupied Arab territories null and void.In spite of Israel’s intransigence and continued refusalto cooperate with the co-sponsors of the peace process inthe Middle East to finalize this process and bring it to aconclusion  my country  believing in the significance andinevitability of peace in this region  declares in this forumits full support of the endeavours made by the co-sponsors in particular those of the United States. In this regard  Iwould like to highlight the commendable role of theEuropean Union and its continued economic support forthe Palestinian National Authority. I call on theinternational community to extend every possibleassistance to the Palestinian National Authority and itsvarious educational  health and social institutions that willsafeguard what is achieved in the context of this peaceprocess.The decision by the Arab countries to follow thecourse of peace is a strategic option  and they havegenuinely worked towards achieving this purpose basedon their belief that for all the peoples of the region including Israel  peace is required for prosperity andstability. Based on this  the Sultanate of Oman once againaffirms its solidarity with the Palestinian people andsupports the position of the Palestinian National Authorityregarding the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the landsoccupied since 1967  thus allowing the PalestinianNational Authority to extend its control to all its lands including the Holy City of Jerusalem.We stress the necessity for Iraq to fully implementall relevant Security Council resolutions to eliminate itsarsenal of all weapons of mass destruction. Fullycognizant of the fact that the United Nations SpecialCommission has not been able to finalize its inspection we call for persistent efforts to end the hardship borne bythe fraternal Iraqi people. By the same token  we callupon the Secretary-General to intensify his efforts to findcommon ground for cooperation and to build confidencebetween the Special Commission and the IraqiGovernment. We also call upon Iraq to cooperate fullywith the ad hoc Tripartite Commission mandated tofollow up on the issue of the prisoners of war andmissing persons  either Kuwaitis or other nationalities and to facilitate their release in order to end this tragedyfor their families.In the Gulf region we are witnessing a new era ofpositive cooperation between the Gulf CooperationCouncil (GCC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Wewelcome this significant development  which willencourage us to work in a genuine manner to create apropitious climate for enabling the United Arab Emiratesto exercise its sovereign rights on the islands of GreaterTunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. Moreover  we shouldbe able to take the relations between the Islamic Republicof Iran and the GCC to a new level of cooperation on thebasis of the principle of mutual benefit international law.12The efforts exerted in the field of disarmament aim toensure international security and stability. My country hasalways expressed its unqualified support for these efforts.We also emphasize the need for taking practical measuresto make the Middle East and the Gulf area zones free ofweapons of mass destruction  including nuclear weapons.The Sultanate of Oman signed the Chemical WeaponsConvention in 1992 and acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1997. Iannounce here that my country has decided to sign theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). We lookforward to seeing Israel take part in the efforts to make theMiddle East a region free of nuclear weapons and to seeingit place all its nuclear facilities under the strict control andfull safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency.With regard to the situation in Somalia  my countrywould like to commend the efforts by Egypt  as well as byEthiopia and the neighbouring countries  to reconcile theSomalis and to convene a national reconciliationconference. We believe such a conference will help theSomalis rebuild their State in the national interest of thebrotherly Somali people. We call upon the United Nationsto extend tangible support to these efforts.As the world celebrates in 1998 the fiftieth anniversaryof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  adopted bythe United Nations General Assembly in 1948  theSultanate of Oman actively participated in the DiplomaticConference to establish the International Criminal Court which was held in Rome during June and July. Weemphasize the need for this newly established Court towork in harmony and complementarity with nationaljurisdictions of Member States.We express our deep concern regarding the ongoingcivil war in Afghanistan  which has resulted in the totaldestruction of that country and has intensified the sufferingof its people. It has also had a serious negative impact onthe unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of thisMuslim nation. We call upon all warring factions inAfghanistan to reconcile in a manner that will bring peaceand stability to the people. In this regard  we would like toexpress our support of and appreciation for the initiatives ofthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the UnitedNations Special Mission to Afghanistan  headed by theSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General  Mr. LakhdarBrahimi.The successive crises in the African continent havedemonstrated the complexity of the political  economic andsocial situation therein. Rescuing Africa requires concertedinternational efforts to overcome its difficulties. Inparticular  African countries need international assistanceto continue the process of reform and economicdevelopment. We believe that unified international actionis necessary more than ever to support the United Nationscoordination of efforts of the international donororganizations and the efforts on the regional level by theOrganization of African Unity and the neighbouringcountries in the areas of conflict with a view to promotingdevelopment and progress in the African continent.The current situation in Kosovo and the persecutionand killings of the Albanian Muslims and others in thisregion have been deplored and denounced by theinternational community. We condemn the use ofterrorism and violence in international relations as a meanto resolve political differences. We call for thecontainment and just settlement of this crisis.While realizing the national reasons why India andPakistan each carried out its latest nuclear tests  wecontinue to call upon the two neighbouring countries topromptly sign the NPT and CTBT in order to prevent theescalation of the arms race in other regions of the world.We hope that the circumstances will allow them to do so.As the United Nations plays its role to eliminate alllethal weapons from this globe  my country would like tocommend the international efforts that have led to theadoption in December 1997 of the Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction. This achievement should alleviate thesufferings and spare the lives of thousands of innocentcivilians who might fall victim to this kind of weapon.In the context of preserving the environment  theSultanate of Oman has submitted a proposal to theregional organization for the protection of marine life inthe Gulf to establish bunkering ports for oil tankers inorder to protect the territorial waters and preserve themarine life in the region from pollution.On the economic front  the current situation has hada negative impact on economic growth in Oman  just asit has elsewhere in the world. But Oman is determined toproceed with its plans for economic diversification andharmonization with the regional and internationaleconomic environment.13On the national level  Oman has carried out thepolicies  legislation and other measures conducive toforeign investment  based on the principles of a marketeconomy. At the regional level  my country participatesactively in regional economic gatherings. Within the GCC and thanks to the spirit of partnership among memberStates and the economic integration legislation  the rates ofgrowth in the non-oil sectors have substantially increased.In the Indian Ocean Rim Association for regionalcooperation  my country is an active participant in effortsto promote and invigorate economic trade cooperation. Inthis context  I would like to draw your attention to theinvestment by the Sultanate of Oman in infrastructureprojects such as the port of Raysut in the southern regionof Oman  Dhofar. This port will offer services to containerships and will enhance international maritime trade andtransport in our region.At the international level  my country is workingtowards membership in the World Trade Organization(WTO)  and we are fully committed to taking the necessarysteps to assure our full participation and responsibilitieswithin that organization.The Sultanate of Oman thus works in a diligent andcooperative manner to promote the development ofeconomic relations with other nations and with regional andinternational groupings for mutual benefit and thepromotion of international trade and investment.The Sultanate of Oman stands ready to extend thehand of friendship to all peace-loving nations."
"129",5445,"PAK",53,1998,"Mr. President I wish tocongratulate you on your well-deserved election to presideover this session of the General Assembly. It is taking placeat a time of profound change and disturbing economic andpolitical developments in various parts of the world. Yourresponsibilities are correspondingly imposing. I amconfident that your accomplishments will be similarlysignificant.Pakistan also wishes to convey its sincere appreciationto your predecessor  Mr. Udovenko  for the skilful andproductive manner in which he guided the Assembly?s workover the past year.As we seek to build the structures for peace andprosperity on the eve of a new millennium  the UnitedNations has become even more indispensable. In anincreasingly interdependent world  the United Nations is theonly organization where nations can come together andevolve decisions democratically on critical social andpolitical issues which affect all peoples. Pakistan hasprofound faith in the purposes and the promise of theUnited Nations.I wish to pay a warm tribute to our Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  who has moved to revive the UnitedNations with bold reforms. These reforms must reinforcethe democratic ethos of the United Nations  especially inthe Security Council  where the endeavour of some is tocreate new centres of privilege rather than eliminate oldinequalities. The reform we pursue must be inspired by thenoble vision of the United Nations Charter: social justice universal prosperity and global peace and security. To doanything else is to do less than history demands of us.We are living in times of change and promise. Thedays of global confrontation are gone and doctrines ofcontainment have lost relevance. The information andtechnological revolutions have brought about a phenomenalinteraction among the peoples of the world. The globalvillage is a reality. Today  the prosperity of one regionsupplements and supports that of another. The creed of ourtimes must be partnership for peace and development. Itwill be an irony if the new vision and possibilities are lostbecause of narrow prejudices and interests.The world is also pervaded with a deep sense offoreboding. We are being propelled into a future whichappears anarchic and insecure. In recent months  thetriumphal hopes for the spread of free markets democratic freedoms and world peace have sufferedsobering setbacks. The crisis spreading from the erstwhileeconomic dynamo of East Asia has shaken confidence inthe prescriptions of trade and financial liberalization. Withfalling incomes and failing hopes  strife has spread amongand within nations in virtually every part of the world.This will negate the emerging prospects for endinghunger  disease and ignorance universally.New conflicts have appeared  while many oldproblems persist. The people of Kashmir and Palestinecontinue to suffer. Bosnia has seen a brutal war  and nowKosovo dreads the same fate. Internecine wars havescarred Africa. Afghanistan has yet to recover from theravages of conflict. Peace has remained elusive in theMiddle East. Tensions have been heightened in SouthAsia. There is increasing resort to the unilateral use offorce and arbitrary actions against weaker nations. Themultiple conflicts and suffering around the world haveplaced extraordinary demands on the United Nations.We are pained by the continuing tragedy ofPalestine. The promise of peace has turned to despair anddesperation. Peace cannot be achieved without therealization of the right of self-determination and statehoodof the Palestinian people.Seventeen years of war have completely destroyedAfghanistan — its economy  society and polity. Pakistanhas  more than any other country  borne the consequencesof Afghanistan?s turmoil and suffering. We have a vitalinterest in the restoration of peace and stability inAfghanistan.Pakistan is deeply concerned at the current tensionsbetween Iran and Afghanistan. We will continue to do allwe can to promote peaceful and friendly relationsbetween these two fraternal neighbours. Those responsiblefor the outrageous killing of the personnel seized from theIranian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif must be apprehendedand punished. We call for the release of all remainingIranian personnel and other prisoners held by the partiesto the Afghan conflict. We support a United Nations andOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) fact-findingmission to Afghanistan.We urge reconciliation within Afghanistan throughrealistic compromise and mutual accommodation. We callfor international engagement and dialogue with12Afghanistan to promote the objectives of humanitarianism human rights and peace. We ask for respect for thecountry?s sovereignty and territorial integrity  andobservance of the principles of non-interference and non-use of force.This year the nuclear cloud has cast its dark shadowover South Asia. When India conducted its first explosionin 1974  the reaction of the major Powers was to imposerestraints against Pakistan. We felt compelled to acquire amatching capability. Yet  even after we had done so Pakistan continued to promote a nuclear-weapons-free zone conventional arms restraint and a zero-missile zone inSouth Asia. India rejected all these initiatives.India?s nuclear tests in May should not have come asa surprise to the world. We had warned the world severalweeks before the tests. Even after India conducted its tests the response of the major Powers was weak and ambiguous.Once again  greater energy was devoted to restrainingPakistan than in responding to India.Immediately after its nuclear tests  India?s leadersadopted a belligerent posture towards Pakistan. They toldus that the geostrategic balance had changed and thatPakistan should abandon its principled support for Kashmiriself-determination. Pakistan faced the threat of force. Wefelt compelled to convince India that any militaryaggression against Pakistan would have the most disastrousconsequences.The world must appreciate that Pakistan did notinitiate these tests. India tested to alter the strategic balanceand threatened our security and sovereignty. We waited for17 days for the world to respond. We knew that no countrycould provide us security assurances against a nuclear India.Thus circumstances forced us to test and establish nucleardeterrence in self-defence. We have violated nointernational norm. Regrettably  some friendly countrieshave imposed sanctions and other restrictions againstPakistan. These are unjust. I ask the internationalcommunity to determine who is in the wrong and whyPakistan should be subjected to punitive measures.Pakistan?s nuclear tests were conducted not tochallenge the existing non-proliferation regime  nor to fulfilany great power ambition; they were designed to preventthe threat or use of force against Pakistan. Our tests  inresponse to those of India  thus served the cause of peaceand stability in our region.We are not insensitive to the concerns aroused by theSouth Asian nuclear tests. Despite the transformed strategicsituation  we remain opposed to an arms race  nuclear orconventional. We have announced a unilateral moratoriumon testing. We are prepared to strengthen peace andstability in the region by mutually agreed measures toavoid a war  to create a regime for nuclear restraint andconventional balance and to promote solutions to theunderlying causes of conflict  in particular the Kashmirdispute.We will discuss these issues with India when ourdialogue commences. We are also engaged in a dialoguewith several friendly countries to advance theseobjectives. Pakistan has never contributed to nuclearproliferation. We will continue to adhere strictly to ourpolicy of not exporting sensitive technologies andequipment.Pakistan consistently supported the conclusion of aComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) for over30 years. We voted for the Treaty when it was adoptedby the General Assembly in 1996. We have declared amoratorium on further testing; so has India. There is noreason why the two countries cannot adhere to the CTBT.In a nuclearized South Asia  the CTBT would haverelevance if Pakistan and India were both parties to theTreaty. The Non-Aligned Summit has called for universaladherence to the CTBT  especially by the nuclear-weaponStates. This demand is consistent with the Treaty?srequirement that all nuclear-capable States  includingIndia  must adhere to the CTBT before it can come intoforce. Pakistan will oppose any attempt to change thisfundamental requirement at the conference of Statesparties to the Treaty  scheduled to be held in September1999. Such a change can be made only by consensus.Pakistan is therefore prepared to adhere to the CTBTbefore that conference takes place. However  Pakistan?sadherence to the Treaty will take place only in conditionsfree from coercion or pressure.In this regard  we expect that the arbitraryrestrictions imposed on Pakistan by multilateralinstitutions will be speedily removed. We also expectdiscriminatory sanctions against Pakistan to be lifted. Andwe count on the full support of the world community fora just resolution of the Kashmir dispute.On the nuclear issue  Pakistan will insist on theprinciple of equal treatment with India  whether in termsof status or any kind of incentives. It must also be wellunderstood that if India should resume nuclear testing Pakistan will review its position and  if we have adheredto the CTBT  invoke the supreme interests clause asprovided for under article IX of the Treaty.13Nuclear deterrence between Pakistan and India willremain fragile and dangerous as long as there is a growingimbalance in conventional forces. This needs to beredressed. Above all  durable peace between Pakistan andIndia and restraint in their military postures will be  asalways  critically dependent on the resolution of theKashmir dispute  which has been the root cause of allconflicts and tensions between Pakistan and India.We welcome the recognition in the Secretary-General?s annual report that the“rising tension between India and Pakistan overKashmir and other issues is ... a major cause ofconcern” (A/53/1  para. 18).For almost 50 years  the people of Kashmir have continuedto await the exercise of the right of self-determination  asstipulated in the Security Council?s resolutions. India isobliged to allow the plebiscite prescribed in those UnitedNations resolutions. India has  however  failed to honour itscommitments and resorted instead to a policy based onforce to deny the legitimate rights of the Kashmiri people.Ten years ago  Kashmir?s freedom struggle entered anew phase when Indian forces fired on peaceful Kashmiridemonstrators  killing over 100. Kashmir is now occupiedby a force of 650 000 Indian troops. Over 60 000 Kashmirishave been killed and thousands maimed and arrested.Custodial killings  disappearances  arbitrary arrests andsummary executions continue to be daily occurrences. Thenightmare of the Kashmiri people continues. This year moreover  scores of innocent Kashmiris in Azad Kashmirhave been killed and hundreds injured by intensified Indianartillery and mortar fire. Even as I speak  tensions are highon the line of control.My Government is committed to resolving ourproblem with India through dialogue. This is all the moreimportant in a nuclear environment in which neither sidehas the luxury to contemplate the use of force. In June1997  we agreed with India on an eight-item agenda and amechanism for the dialogue. Unfortunately  the dialoguewas interrupted due to differences over modalities. I am however  happy to say that in a meeting which concludeda short while ago  Prime Minister Vajpayee and I reachedan agreement to resume the dialogue with thecommencement of talks at the Foreign Secretary level which will address at the outset the primary issues of peaceand security and Jammu and Kashmir.The United Nations  the major Powers and theinternational community have a responsibility to supportand facilitate a solution to the Kashmir issue. We requestthe Secretary-General to take appropriate initiatives toimplement Security Council resolutions on Kashmir andto ease tensions and build confidence. In particular  weurge that the United Nations Military Observer Group inIndia and Pakistan be strengthened and its mandateenhanced. The Security Council should regularly monitorthe volatile situation along the line of control in Jammuand Kashmir.Until last year  globalization of the world economypromised the spread of prosperity. Today  30 per cent ofthe world economy is in recession; by next year  thisfigure is projected to double. Across East Asia  currencieshave drastically depreciated  economies have contracted incomes have plummeted and unemployment has risen despite sound economic fundamentals.As the East Asian crisis spreads  questions are beingposed about the economic wisdom of rapid financial andtrade liberalization and the social implications ofglobalization. Yet  in the age of the information andcommunications revolution  globalization cannot bereversed; it can only be effectively governed.The world community must adopt a coherentapproach to the current crisis. In the short term  it isessential to spur economic growth in all parts of theworld. The international financial institutions must relaxtheir unrealistic conditionalities to prevent any furthercontraction of the economies of the developing countries.Mechanisms need to be devised to direct greaterdevelopment finance to the underdeveloped countrieswhich have the largest latent demand. Meanwhile markets  especially those of the industrial countries  mustbe kept open. New protectionism in the guise of concernfor environmental or labour standards must be resisted.In order to address these issues effectively  we haveto proceed from three basic premises. First  decisions onways to manage globalization must be made collectivelyby all nations. Secondly  specific policies must flow fromthe overriding objective of ensuring growth with equity:equity is not only a moral imperative  it is now aprerequisite for sustained global growth. Thirdly  theNorth and South must act together: prosperity for both isinterlinked.This suggests the need for concerted action by theinternational community  which should include  first  the14strengthening of the capacity of multilateral institutions toaddress the issues of trade  finance and development in anintegrated and coherent manner  thereby ensuring theeffective governance of globalization. In this context  aglobal monetary conference to address the old and newproblems of the international finance system is now anecessity and should be convened urgently by the UnitedNations. Secondly  this action should include correcting theinequities in the international trade regime  especially bymore rapid liberalization in areas of primary interest todeveloping countries. And finally  it should includeresolution of the long-standing issues of debt  developmentfinance and access to technology.What is required today is a realization that there isunity in the struggle of the South and the North foreconomic and social development. A new concept of aglobal community appears to be essential: a communitywhere all human beings are acknowledged as being entitledto a life of dignity and to the right to development.The concept of the ummah  or community  in Islamicthought offers a model for the realization of such a globalcommunity. This concept gives primacy to solidarity amonghuman beings and to equitable benefits to all members ofthe community. Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance;it is inherently moderate and progressive. Here  I wouldlike to warmly welcome President Clinton's visionaffirming America?s deep respect for Islam and rejectingthe pernicious thesis of a clash of civilizations. We mustwork together to create greater understanding and harmonyamong all religions and peoples of the world.The present drift towards an uncertain and dangerousworld must be arrested. Inequality  conflicts and abuse ofhuman rights are not the inevitable consequences ofimpersonal forces of history. They are the outcome of ourown actions. It is in our power to fashion a more equitableand more peaceful world. We can do so if we rededicateourselves to the ideals of the United Nations Charter. Onlythen can we ensure that the next century will dawn on aprosperous and peaceful world."
"130",5488,"PAN",53,1998,"At the outset  we wish to express our heartfeltcondolences and solidarity to the peoples of the Caribbeanbecause of the suffering being experienced today in placessuch as Saint Kitts and Nevis  Antigua and Barbuda  St.Maarten  Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic due toHurricane Georges  which has hit the region.The delegation I am honoured to represent joins inthe congratulations extended to Mr. Opertti on his electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession. This constitutes a recognition not only of hisoutstanding ability and merits  but also of the brotherlycountry of Uruguay  whose well-known internationalcalling makes it an outstanding Member andrepresentative of Latin America in this importantinternational body.We are also grateful to his illustrious predecessor Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for his efforts to contribute tothe Organizationâs modernization.At the end of June  during the absence of thePresident of the General Assembly  Panama  as Vice-President  occupied the presidency of the GeneralAssembly and had the honour of cooperating in theadoption of important measures on science  technologyand computers.Our gratitude goes also to the seventh Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who  with the long experiencehe has gained over more than 30 years devoted to theOrganization  is promoting reforms that will be of greatbenefit to the United Nations.18On Security Council reform  we endorse therecommendation of the Open-ended Working Group on theQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in theMembership of the Security Council and Other MattersRelated to the Security Council that consideration of thisitem should continue during the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly on the basis of the work carried out inprevious sessions.Panama recalls with gratitude that the holding of aSecurity Council meeting in Panama a quarter of a centuryago and the support of the international community wereextremely valuable to the Panamanian people in thefulfilment of its aspirations regarding the Canal.Panama attaches great importance to discussionsrelating to economic issues  particularly those addressingsustainable economic development in order to eradicatepoverty. We feel that by improving our education  ourcountries will better be able to focus on processes ofreform  which must be undertaken gradually.With regard to the globalization of the economy  theRepublic of Panama congratulates the Secretary-General forhaving held on the 17 and 18 September a high-leveldialogue on the social and economic impact of globalizationand the interdependence of its political consequences.Panama feels that the matters before the FifthCommittee relating to the process of adopting the budgetare of great importance to the Organization  and we hopethat Member States will faithfully comply with itssuggestions.My delegation believes that we should give fullsupport to measures that will persuade Member States topay on time and in full their obligations to the UnitedNations.In our judgment  the most important tasks to beaccomplished in order to neutralize the present economiccrisis are the restoration of trust in the markets; thestabilization of the financial markets; the support of growth;allocation of the necessary means to the internationalfinancial institutions; and the immediate protection of themost vulnerable.The financial markets and their problems are of globalscope  yet the governmental efforts to resolve thoseproblems have a strictly local range. This disparity is at theroot of many problems we are now facing.Economic globalization makes it necessary tostrengthen the links of the United Nations with the WorldBank  the World Trade Organization (WTO)  theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)  the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  the United NationsChildrenâs Fund (UNICEF) and the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank (IADB).The need to create an even playing field in theinternational system for economic cooperation is urgentand justifies the major efforts ongoing within the UnitedNations to restructure what has been called theâ€œarchitectureâ€ of the system.We support the Secretary-Generalâs repeated callsfor more vigorous action towards some way of alleviatingthe enormous debts that are suffocating many countriesand that they simply cannot carry. It seems to us thateconomic  social and environmental policy dimensionsmust be integrated in such a way that none of them issacrificed for the sake of the others.We were deeply impressed by the wise counsel onpoverty given to us yesterday by President Mandela.We urge the Secretary-General and the communityof the United Nations to continue our efforts to ensurethat the obvious benefits of globalization and its resultantinterdependence do not serve to make the rich richer andthe poor poorer. This could be done by establishingmechanisms that redirect part of the wealth generated tothe praiseworthy goals of creating more hospitals  moremodern schools and a higher standard of living for allpeople.Panama has contributed to the cause of sustainableeconomic development by complying with Agenda 21 andthe mandates of the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development. The concrete result ofthis was the adoption of Law 41 of July 1998  an overallenvironmental law for the Republic of Panama  whichestablishes the basic principles and regulations forprotecting  preserving and restoring the environment.Another result is the preparation of an environmentalstrategy for the country within the framework of a processin which the whole of Panamanian society isparticipating; actions are concerted  and each sector iscommitted to holding up its end.We must have a clear vision of the future whereanything related to the environment is concerned  and we19are sure that the Secretary-General will also make this clearin his plans for the future.Panama has followed with great interest the eventsrelating to peace in the Middle East and the problems ofthe war-torn former Yugoslavia. We support thecomprehensive policy that must be pursued in Africa inorder to move beyond the causes of conflict and promotelasting peace and sustainable development in the region.Similarly  we have followed with great interest theSecretary-Generalâs efforts to advance the negotiationstowards just and lasting peace in Cyprus so that theunification process can quickly be consolidated. We seeserious dangers in the situation in Afghanistan.At the Conference in Rome  my country agreed withall that was said in favour of the establishment of anInternational Criminal Court  and we are prepared  alongwith other Member States in the General Assembly  tomake every effort necessary so that this court can bring tojustice those who have committed serious crimes that are ofconcern to the international community.As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  we recall withrespect and admiration the work carried out by the greatPanamanian internationalist Mr. Ricardo J. Alfaro  who wasinstrumental in the drafting of this document that is soimportant to humanity.We will always be attentive to the need for UnitedNations programmes and policies to express the concern wefeel over the violations of human rights that still occur incertain places.With the establishment of its Ministry for Youth Women  Children and the Family  the Republic of Panamahas taken a very active part in protecting the rights ofchildren in the workplace and is vigorously combating allaspects of prostitution and child pornography. We thereforeapplaud the work being carried out by the Committee onthe Elimination of Discrimination against Women  and wenote with great satisfaction the effective work being donein this area by the Office of the First Lady of Panama.We noted with concern the nuclear tests conducted byIndia and Pakistan  and condemned them at the time  sincethey run counter to the principles of non-proliferation ofnuclear weapons. At the same time  we would like to seeimplemented all the agreements included in the chemicaland biological weapons conventions.Panama continues to take an interest in the ban onanti-personnel landmines  and we are ever vigilant toensure that our territory is free of these extremelydangerous mines.The recent acts of terrorism in Africa and Europe areserious and unjustifiable crimes. They show clearly theneed to further strengthen the legal and politicalframework to combat this scourge. We share the concernsexpressed here yesterday regarding the dangers ofterrorism.As we stated at the recent Summit of Heads of Stateand Government of the Rio Group  which was held in ourcountry  we reaffirm the importance of strengtheningcooperation to combat terrorism at both the bilateral andmultilateral levels  with full respect for the sovereigntyand jurisdiction of each State.Internationally  we reiterate our commitment to andsupport for efforts by the international community tocombat terrorism  since terrorist activities  whatever theirpurpose and motivation  are  in addition to being aviolation of human rights  immoral criminal acts  extremeacts of fanaticism that attack freedom  human life and thedevelopment of peoples.Regarding drug-trafficking  we are convinced thatthe most effective way to make progress in combatingdrugs would be to see it as a multilateral problem  alwaysbearing in mind respect for the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of each country. Panama therefore firmlysupports the tasks and commitments established at thetwentieth special session of the General Assembly  whichwas devoted to the common struggle against the worlddrug problem  as well as the principles andresponsibilities established by the Organization ofAmerican States in this matter.From 4 to 6 September  just a few days ago  ameeting of the heads of State and Government of the RioGroup was held in Panama  this yearâs Secretariat of theRio Group  a consultative body for political harmonycomprising 14 Latin American countries. The LatinAmerican community is increasingly convinced that withsolid cooperation resulting from political consensus of theRio Group member States we can make greater strides atboth the national and international levels.Through the annual meetings of the heads of Stateand Government and the Foreign Ministers of the regionwe have established common objectives and20commitments  which cover strengthening our democracies questions of international peace and security  drug-trafficking  terrorism  human rights  combating poverty sustainable development and international trade  as well asnew issues  such as the year 2000 computer problem andthe international financial crisis.At the Rio Group meeting held in Quito in 1995  theRepublic of Panama offered its territory as the headquartersfor a forum where countries of the region could join inconsidering policies and measures aimed to eradicatetrafficking in narcotics and other illicit substances  as wellas in coordinating anti-drug measures and trainingprogrammes  which effectively support our efforts tocombat drug-trafficking in the region.The Universal Congress on the Panama Canal  meetingin our capital from 7 to 10 September 1997  clearly showedthe need for contact with the international maritimecommunity  the users and clients of the Canal  andconsidered creating an advisory board of the CanalAuthority  in order to make use of the experience andwisdom of men and women throughout the world.We reiterate our pledge that the Panama Canal willalways be a public service  international in character andefficient and safe  without any form of discrimination. Weare ready to assume full management of the Panama Canalon 31 December 1999  thus consolidating our territoryunder a single flag.This is an appropriate occasion to reaffirm to theinternational community that after 31 December 1999Panama will never again renounce control of the Canal which is in our territory; it will be a symbol of theaspirations of many generations of Panamanians who havewanted this Canal to be an integral part of our territory ina free  independent and sovereign nation.In conclusion  I believe it is fitting to recall here thefollowing words of the President of Panama  Dr. ErnestoPÃ©rez Balladares  to our Legislative Assembly on 1September:â€œI wish to reiterate once again my commitmentto democracy and my commitment to prepare for thetransfer of the Canal without exclusions and withoutpolitical sectarianism. The elections on 2 May 1999will determine who will lead the country into thetwenty-first century and who will close once and forall this historic era for our territory. For my part  I amcertain that on 1 September 1999 there will be aPresident and a Legislative Assembly electedthrough transparent and democratic elections; thatour nation is now prepared to assume full control ofthe Canal and its adjacent areas; and that  above all the country will be reconciled  in peace and preparedto enter the next millennium without the presence offoreign military bases and with a modern prosperous economy.â€"
"131",5535,"PER",53,1998,"Through you  Sir  I would like to congratulate thePresident of the General Assembly on his election  whichwas so richly deserved because of his vast experience ininternational affairs and his well-known personal qualities.Uruguay  a friend to Peru  represents the authenticaspiration to peace and respect for international law that arestandards of conduct for Latin America and for Peru.I hereby reaffirm my countryâs unwavering adherenceto the purposes  principles and standards enshrined in theCharter of the United Nations  which provide a guaranteeof harmonious relations among States and of the fullapplicability of international law  as well as a foundationfor the worldwide promotion of human rights  economicand social development and cooperation for development â€”all touchstones of international peace and security.Only 10 years ago  the community of nations wasmoved by the dream of building a peaceful  democratic equitable and multilateral new world order. Today  whilewe appreciate the continuing extension throughout theworld of those positive tendencies  we note as well anaccumulation of negative developments that threaten toinitiate a period of uncertainty and change posingunprecedented challenges to our multilateral institutionsand urgently demanding analyses and strategies toconfront them.The world financial crisis is affecting the veryfoundations of the international system. The provision ofemergency financial relief may help individual countries but it does not contribute to the health of the system as awhole  and it highlights the imperfections of the existingsupervisory mechanisms. There is thus a need for areview of the Bretton Woods institutions and a revision oftheir policies so as to adapt them to current reality.The growing imbalance among countries in theeconomic and social areas is another deeply troublingelement. The 1998 Human Development Report indicatesthat 20 per cent of the inhabitants of high-incomecountries consume 86 per cent of the worldâs goods andservices. In contrast  the poorest 20 per cent consume lessthan 2 per cent. This reality underscores the urgent needto foster real sustainable human development throughoutthe world  as well as within our countries  which areconfronting the challenge of relieving excruciatingpoverty.Not only is it urgently necessary to strengthenmultilateral institutions and achieve friendly cooperation but it actually can be done. A few indications of currentpositive trends are the worldwide consolidation ofdemocracy  the recognition of the central value ofindividuals and their inherent rights  the participation ofcivil society  the need to modify patterns of consumptionand production for the advancement of sustainabledevelopment  the development and dissemination oftechnology and the significant though as yet insufficientprogress in the fight against drug-trafficking and thestruggle against poverty.Understanding continues to grow among Statesregarding the concept of sustainable human development.For the past eight years  we Peruvians have been engagedin a process of national reconstruction and structuralreform  the overriding aim of which is the eradication ofpoverty.31The Peruvian Government  under the leadership ofPresident Alberto Fujimori  continues to implement a seriesof policies and programmes to improve the quality of lifeof all our citizens. The fundamental element of these effortsis the strategy for the fight against poverty. Our firmcommitment to eradicating poverty is reflected in thenational budget  which allocates more than 40 per cent tosocial spending. The national priority is the reduction ofextreme poverty by 50 per cent â€” from 19 per cent to 10per cent of the population â€” by the year 2000. Along thesame lines  the Peruvian Government accords greatimportance to policies aimed at achieving gender equalityand the full participation of women  population policies andpolicies for the protection of the most vulnerable: children the elderly  the handicapped and internally displacedpersons.In the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  Peru remains committed togiving substantive meaning to its content  incorporating itsprinciples in legislation and putting them into practicethrough education and information and by including themin policies of development. The protection and fostering ofhuman rights is a priority and a duty for Peruvians  whichis why we defend the universality  indivisibility comprehensiveness and non-discriminatory application ofhuman rights.My country has signed and ratified almost all theinternational instruments concerning human rights  bothuniversal and regional. Consequently  we call upon thosecountries that still are not parties to the two InternationalCovenants on human rights and to the AmericanConvention on Human Rights to ratify them  not only inhonour of the fiftieth anniversary but also so that they willbe consistent with the principles they continually espousein the international arena.The persistence of new non-military global threats â€”such as international terrorism  the intensification oforganized crime  corruption and the problem of drugs â€”adds to the gravity of the present international situation.Peru  which has suffered from terrorist violence  knows thatthis barbarism constitutes an assault on the individual andon society as a whole. It aims to destroy democracy andfundamental freedoms  in addition to threatening the peaceand security of nations. In consequence  we consider allterrorist acts a systematic and deliberate violation of humanrights that cannot be justified by any ideology or for anyother reason  and that they should therefore be treated onlyas criminal acts.Peru categorically condemns terrorism in all itsforms and manifestations and urges the internationalcommunity to combat it vigorously. With the samedetermination  Peru reiterates that cases of internationalterrorism should be resolutely combated within theframework of international law.In 1990 there were 120 thousand hectares of coca inPeru. Today  in a spectacular decline  this has beenreduced by half  and with it the number of peasantfamilies linked to the coca economy. Throughprogrammes of alternative development it is possible toavoid a resurgence in the supply of coca leaves. Wetherefore need to combine national efforts withinternational support to overcome a complex problem thatis a matter of shared responsibility. In this regard  we arepromoting debt-swap programmes for alternativedevelopment projects. We have also convened a donorconsulting group  which will meet next November sponsored by the Inter-American Bank  the Inter-American Commission for the Control of Drug Abuse andthe European Union.As President Alberto Fujimori stated during thespecial session of the General Assembly devoted to thedrug problem â€œThe purpose of the meeting is to secure thecomplementary financial resources required toimplement alternative development  prevention andrehabilitation programmes within the framework ofanti-poverty policies and the sustainable managementof natural resources.â€ (A/S-20/PV.2  p. 2)I strongly reaffirm that my country is committed tofighting drug-trafficking and its related effects until theyare eradicated. The criminal structures of drug-traffickingcannot be given any respite during which they mightreconstitute themselves. For this reason the internationalcommunity must intensify its joint efforts to put an end tothis scourge that affects humanity.Because Peru has recently experienced a crisissituation  we face major difficulties resulting frominternally displaced communities. Throughout the worldthere has been a dramatic increase in the number of theinternally displaced in recent years  which makes itessential to strengthen United Nations action in thissphere. Consequently  we declare before the GeneralAssembly the urgent need to further deepen and expandthe mandates  programmes and sources of funding for thesystemâs specialized agencies and bodies  with the aim of32prioritizing assistance to those countries affected by thisproblem.Peru is a peace-loving nation which works for peaceand rejects conflict; which aspires to strengthen politicaland economic cooperation with all countries and groups ofcountries in different regions  on the basis of commoninterests and mutual benefit.In the realm of peace and security  the internationalcommunity must now unite against new tendencies towardsnuclear proliferation and a growing number of internalconflicts and conflicts between States in various parts of theworld. To this must be added conventional arms races andthe hundreds of thousands of anti-personnel mines that arestill deployed in the world  whose shocking and unjustconsequences we all know. These facts together threaten tooverwhelm the existing capacities of our countries and ourinternational institutions.Peru vigorously supports general and completedisarmament under strict international control. This is botha necessary condition for peace and an ongoing task of ourOrganization.Deplorable recent developments in the sphere ofnuclear proliferation underscore the urgency of perfectingthe existing non-proliferation regimes and the imperativeneed for negotiations on nuclear disarmament to goforward. The proposed fourth special session of the GeneralAssembly devoted to disarmament will have to considerthese questions on a priority basis. We Latin Americansnow appreciate all the more the Treaty of Tlatelolco  whichcreated in our region the first inhabited zone of the planetto be free of nuclear weapons  and we are continuing todevelop ties of cooperation with other nuclear-weapon-freezones.My country was the first Latin American State toratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  andconsequently rejects any kind of nuclear test anywhere inthe world.The Convention on anti-personnel landmines is apositive sign of change on the international scene. Thismakes plain the humanitarian concerns that inspire theconscience of the world. We are pleased that it will enterinto force in March 1999  and are particularly interested inits full implementation after that date. Accordingly  theinternational community will have to give its activecooperation and make the utmost effort to remove ordestroy the mines already planted in every region of theworld.Peru was one of the first countries to ratify theOttawa Convention and it already begun to adopt itsapplicable provisions. We call upon all countries whichhave not yet done so to ratify or adhere to the OttawaConvention as soon as possible  as a contribution topeace  security  human coexistence and the developmentof our peoples. We trust that those States which havealready signed it but have not yet ratified it will complywith article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law ofTreaties  under which signatory nations must abstain fromacts which would frustrate the purpose of the OttawaConvention.We believe that the United Nations Regional Centrefor Peace  Disarmament and Development in LatinAmerican and the Caribbean  which has its headquartersin Lima  can contribute to promoting a culture of peaceand strengthening the efforts towards disarmament in theregion  including dealing with the problem of mines.In the foregoing scenario  the reform andstrengthening of the United Nations system take on evengreater importance. Change and adjustment lead to greaterefficiency. The process of structural and functional reformof the United Nations  rendered imperative byglobalization and changes on the international scene makes it necessary to ensure the coherence of itsprogrammes and activities and to transform theOrganization into an agent of sustainable humandevelopment.We believe that it is appropriate and timely tocontinue our efforts to define the criteria that shouldguide reform of the Security Council. Decisions on thisfundamental matter should necessarily be adopted on thebasis of the broadest possible agreement and in the spiritand letter of the Charter of the United Nations  whichwould itself be revised. The modifications we desire aimtowards a more representative and efficient worldOrganization. In that regard  this effort must not give wayto confrontation and discord. Let us rather support allefforts directed towards allowing the Organization torespond to the real needs of all its Member States.33Peru pays tribute to the peacekeeping operations of theUnited Nations on their fiftieth anniversary and honours thememory of the men and women  soldiers  police andcivilians  including Peruvian nationals  who have sacrificedtheir lives in this noble mission. The peacekeepingoperations  in some of which my country took part  areemblematic of the responsibility that the Charter assigns toour Organization.We wish to reiterate  Mr. President  our best wishes toyou and to the Assembly in this new period we areentering  which will surely have important implications forthe international community."
"132",5582,"PHL",53,1998,"I am pleased  on behalf ofmy delegation  to extend to Mr. Opertti our warmestcongratulations on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session.Just three months ago  the Philippines commemoratedthe centennial of the birth of Asia’s first Republic. A monthbefore that the Filipino people conducted the most sacredrite of a democracy: the election of national leaders bypopular will. The successful electoral process resulted in thesecond peaceful transfer of power since our “people power”revolution of 1986. President Joseph Ejercito Estrada  witha resounding mandate from the Filipino people  has takenover the task of leading the Philippines into its secondcentury as a free and democratic nation. But he does so ata very trying time; he must steer the ship of state on veryturbulent waters  with global forecasts painting a pictureof even more stormy weather ahead.And the Asian economic crisis rolls on; it is nolonger just Asian nor entirely economic. It will wreakhavoc anywhere and spare no one. It has already hit thePhilippines hard  though perhaps not as badly as someother countries. Yet  for us  the only tenable direction togo is forward; to go back is to founder. Thus  the EstradaAdministration’s economic policy will remain market-friendly  even as it is pro-poor and pro-business. ThePhilippines will keep the momentum of economic reformand strengthen in particular its financial and bankingsectors.Like all other States  the Philippines pursues foreignpolicy to promote national security and development. Butwe view national security beyond the traditional concernsof sovereignty and territorial integrity. For in a globalregime characterized by evolving multipolarity of politicaland military power and by growing economic andfinancial interdependence  with all their attendantopportunities and risks  my nation’s peace and prosperityincreasingly depend on stability and growth abroad. AsPresident Estrada has said  our way of life  ourfundamental values and our institutions can flourish andfind true expression only if we enjoy political stability economic solidarity  sociocultural cohesion  moralconsensus and ecological balance  at home as well as withour partners in the world. Our national security anddevelopment demand that we actively advance theinternationally shared goals of freedom  openness  peace prosperity and justice.It is in this context that the Philippines regards theUnited Nations  which it helped found 53 years ago  as amost important partner in our efforts to promote our ownnational security and development.Our part of the world  the Asia-Pacific region  is thescene of growing regional cooperation coexisting side byside with regional tensions. The Association of South-EastAsian Nations (ASEAN) has not only increased itsmembership but has also expanded its work from thepurely economic and social to the security and politicalfields. It took the lead in creating the ASEAN RegionalForum — the only regional security dialogue mechanismthat brings together all the Powers with a stake in peaceand stability in East Asia and the Western Pacific. ThePhilippines hosted the fifth ASEAN Regional Forum lastJuly and is gratified with the growing trust andconfidence among Forum participants and with the6progress in the promotion of greater transparency andmutual understanding in the region.Nevertheless  the Asia-Pacific region is not tension-free. Territorial disputes and issues left over from theSecond World War fester. The Philippines hopes that as thenew millennium dawns meaningful action towards theresolution of such issues will commence in earnest amongthe countries concerned.Peace in the Korean peninsula is essential. ThePhilippines supports ongoing efforts  including those of theFour-Party Talks and of the Korean Peninsula EnergyDevelopment Organization (KEDO)  to build thefoundations of peace in the Korean peninsula.Peace in the South China Sea is crucial to peace andprosperity in East Asia. The Philippines encourages allparties concerned to scrupulously observe the principlescontained in the ASEAN Declaration on the South ChinaSea of 1992.The ratification of the Treaty establishing the AfricanEconomic Community augurs well for Africa. The effortsat conflict resolution and prevention by the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) and subregional organizations such asthe Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  deserve to be lauded.Nonetheless  one cannot escape the fact that the moreintense of today’s conflicts have occurred in Africa. Thetragic events in Rwanda  in Burundi  between Ethiopia andEritrea  in Sierra Leone and now in the Congo are familiarto us all. Although these States are responsible for theirfuture  the recurring and protracted conflicts in Africademand a multilateral response to the political  economicand social ills of the region  and the need to addressdevelopment issues is paramount. We also cannot afford toignore the humanitarian disasters such as those in theSudan. Indeed  political stability is required in Africa  butso is aid. Let no one in this Hall forget Africa and ourcollective duty to alleviate human suffering there.The Philippines firmly hopes that the Middle Eastpeace process will resume in earnest and encompass allrelevant parties. We reaffirm the need to achieve acomprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East.The growing number of signatures to and ratificationsof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) andthe review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) raised hopes that nuclear weaponswere becoming obsolete. Unfortunately  the nuclear-weapon States have yet to live up to their NPTcommitments. Moreover  the recent nuclear tests in SouthAsia were a destabilizing development.The proliferation of missile technology andcapability is just as fraught with danger  if not moredangerous  than the spread of nuclear weapons. These twomake for a deadly combination for everyone; both mustbe stopped. So  too  must the continuing development andstockpiling of other weapons of mass destruction cease.Likewise  we need to put an end to the unregulatedtransfer and indiscriminate and often illegal circulation ofsmall arms and light weapons.The Philippines is also deeply committed to thebanning and destruction of anti-personnel landmines. MyGovernment is deeply gratified that our common intenseeffort to conclude the Convention on anti-personnel minessucceeded last December. We strongly urge States thathave not yet done so to sign the Convention. We urge allto assist in landmine clearance and the rehabilitation oflandmine victims.Political instability and the collapse of peace andorder in any State produce deleterious effects  includingsecurity threats for others. For this reason  the Philippinescontributes where it can to the establishment orrestoration of political stability in other lands  particularlyin support of democracy.Cambodia’s recently held elections have been judgedfree and fair. But  as recent developments in that countryshow  democratic elections  while necessary  are not asufficient condition for democracy or for peace andstability. Cooperation by all Cambodian parties  promptedby a deeper love for the nation’s good  is required.The efforts of the ASEAN troika  the Friends ofCambodia and the United Nations have not been in vain;they have just not been enough. Much could be done bythe international community; but so much more needs tobe done by the Cambodians themselves to pull theircountry back from the brink.The Philippines hopes to see a fully stable South-East Asia  where all peoples enjoy peace and nationalreconciliation. We hope to see all 10 countries in theregion working together for a united and outward-lookingSouth-East Asia  bonded in a partnership of dynamicdevelopment and in a community of caring societies.Thus  we are committed to assisting Myanmar and Laos7in their integration into a peaceful  prosperous  humane andjust ASEAN.Peace and order are threatened by the evils ofterrorism and transnational crime. Terrorism is a crimeagainst humanity  and we strongly condemn it.Transnational crime in all its guises  including drug-trafficking  trafficking in women and children  and money-laundering  must be stopped. The Philippines joins the restof the international community in hailing the adoption ofthe Rome statute of the International Criminal Court. I wishto convey my Government’s serious intention to considerthe matter of accession to that treaty in the near future.The world needs economic solidarity. And the Asiancrisis  which has spread to other regions  is our immediateglobal concern. For in its wake  millions of lives have beenafflicted  with untold suffering. In its path  nations may fall.The Bretton Woods institutions have played a vital role inthe global economy. But it is now clear that their methodsand their resources  particularly those of the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF)  are sorely insufficient to contain thecrisis and to restore the health of afflicted economies. Weneed to replenish IMF resources  augment the funds of theWorld Bank and the regional banks  and develop newremedies for the new problems of a globalized economy.The United Nations can play a significant role infostering international cooperation and action to solve theglobal crisis and mitigate its effects. Together  we can fightprotectionism. The suffering spawned by the crisis must beaddressed. The significant decline in official developmentassistance from donor countries needs to be reversed. Nowmore than ever  social amelioration programmes and safetynets must be enhanced.The crisis has forced us  too  to focus attention on thequality of governance. The issues of corruption andcronyism have been catapulted to the top of nationaldebates. The ensuing convergence of ideas and resolvetowards greater transparency and a more level playing field at home and throughout the world  should be boons to ourpeoples and nations.The financial crisis has also confronted us with thereality that the world is dealing with a new phenomenon.This is the phenomenon of massive amounts of capitalflowing across national borders at lightning speed  bloatingeconomies into fragile bubbles as they rush in and shakingeconomies to their foundations as they are withdrawn. Thisis one aspect of globalization that carries great peril. Itrequires much diligent study and delicate handling.We have long recognized the need to recast theglobal trading regime and make it more responsive to therequirements of our time. Our efforts on this are welladvanced. Now we must begin the work on the globalfinancial system. Together  we must plan and build a newarchitecture that best suits today’s and tomorrow’s needs.The Philippines welcomes President Clinton’s eight-point agenda to lead the world out of the current globaleconomic and financial instability. Real action is what theworld  not just Asia  needs urgently. Indeed  threateningclouds are overhead. Lives are needlessly shattered. Weneed to limit the damage now and start rebuilding as soonas we can.Another lesson the crisis teaches us is about howbrittle and fleeting high growth in gross domestic productis. It is not difficult to associate the roots of civil unrestin the wake of economic hardships with the lack of socialjustice on the ground. The poor  who get hit first andhardest in any economic downturn  will always be restiveif development yields dividends only for the rich. Thecrisis makes us realize that the fruits of prosperity and thepains of sacrifice must be enjoyed or borne equitably.The globalization of information and the media mayhave reduced cultural barriers to the point ofhomogenizing certain cultural aspects of life. But theworld continues to suffer from cultural intolerance. Theplight of children  the rights and advancement of womenand human rights in general still need to be addressedvigorously by the international community. Thecontinuing exploitation of children for pornography prostitution and drug-trafficking  not to mention thesuffering of displaced and refugee children  is a globalproblem. The Convention on the Rights of the Childshould guide international action in this area. At theregional level  the Philippines and the United Kingdom under the aegis of the Asia-Europe Meeting  havelaunched a joint initiative on child welfare with a view tocreating a better international cooperation mechanism onthis endeavour.The Philippines attaches great importance to thepromotion and protection of the rights of migrant workersand their families  and we continue to call upon allcountries to accede to the International Convention on theProtection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers andMembers of Their Families.All human rights — political  civil  social andeconomic — are universal  indivisible  interdependent and8interrelated. So long as any or all of these rights are notrespected globally  we cannot rest  even as we celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. For the Philippines  the best and surest way topromote social justice and human rights is through a sincerecommitment to the rule of law. And one law that is self-evident and immutable in all cultures is the sanctity ofhuman life and the dignity of the human person.Many of the international commitments made at theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment  particularly Agenda 21  remain unfulfilled.And sadly  no new or additional resources needed bydeveloping countries to implement many of the actionsagreed at the Summit have materialized. We appeal forearly action on these points.Sustainable development continues to be an importantfocus of Philippine foreign policy. As Chair of the sixthsession of the Commission on Sustainable Development  thePhilippines emphasized the role of civil society in theimplementation of cooperative activities in key areas suchas freshwater resources  the role of industry  technologytransfer and capacity-building in development.Last April  the Philippines signed the Kyoto Protocolto the United Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange. We join other States parties to the Convention inurging the speedy entry into force of that Protocol.Addressing global challenges and problems requiresinternational action and cooperation. The United Nationsremains the principal multilateral forum for the initiation ofsuch action and cooperation. As a founding member  thePhilippines recognizes that the United Nations must havethe active support of all its Members and adequateresources in order to be effective. We have supported thevarious reform exercises undertaken in the past years  andwe will continue to do so  to ensure the continued relevanceof this our reliable partner.Inasmuch as the overwhelming majority of UnitedNations members are from the developing world  the UnitedNations reform process must restore development issues tothe core of the United Nations agenda. It should also enablethe General Assembly to fulfil effectively its Charter-mandated responsibilities.There is a pressing need to modernize and reform theSecurity Council. The Council is the United Nations organwith the primary responsibility for maintaining internationalpeace and security  and its decisions must be viewed asserving the collective interest of all United NationsMembers. Thus  its membership must be enlarged toinclude more key global players and developing countries.Its working methods and decision-making processesshould become more transparent and democratic.As a democracy  the Philippines is convinced thatglobal efforts and cooperation to achieve peace  prosperityand development can succeed only if democracy thriveswithin nations and serves as the basis for relationsbetween and among them. At the global level  thisrequires respect for the principle of sovereign equalityamong States  the commitment to enrich  not beggar  oneanother  the need to uphold and defend the principles ofthe United Nations Charter and international law  thepacific settlement of disputes  the promotion of all humanrights  and respect for the one and only world we live in.Without exception  all nations need to cooperate and bepart of the solution to all the world’s woes. For we are allin this together  and there are no others to blame. AsShakespeare admonished  “The fault  dear Brutus  is notin our stars  But in ourselves  that we are underlings“(Julius Caesar  Act I  scene 2)."
"133",5642,"PNG",53,1998,"On behalf of thepeople and the Government of Papua New Guinea  I wishto join previous speakers in congratulating you Mr. President  on your election to your important post.Your unanimous election as President of the GeneralAssembly shows the esteem in which the internationalcommunity holds both you  personally  and your country Uruguay. The Papua New Guinea delegation is confidentthat you will guide this fifty-third session of the GeneralAssembly to a successful conclusion.May I also take this opportunity  through you  toexpress my delegationâs sincere appreciation to yourpredecessor  the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for his outstanding stewardshipin facilitating the work of the fifty-second session of theGeneral Assembly.We would also like to place on record ourappreciation to the Secretary-General and the Secretariatstaff for the care they put into the planning of the affairsof our Organization.This is the first occasion on which I have addressedthe General Assembly. The year since I was electedPrime Minister has been a year of great challenge inwhich my Government has been confronted withproblems associated with natural disasters and those thathave resulted from many years of neglect.The realities of life in the rapidly shrinking worldmean that a partnership must  in practice  be turned intosomething practical and viewed in a much broader globalperspective as an element of a worldwide partnership inmanaging and  where possible  directing change.The point is brought home by a series of naturaldisasters which have affected Papua New Guinea over thepast year. First came the drought caused by the El NiÃ±oeffect  and then followed frosts  which led to severe foodshortages in many different parts of the country. Thencame the tsunami which completely destroyed villages inthe Aitape area of the Sandaun province on the northcoast of the mainland  killing more than 2 100 people mainly children and women  and injuring many more. Inbetween came floods and landslides  which caused deathand destruction in several places. Meanwhile  people11around Rabaul continue to cope with the effects and try torebuild in the aftermath of the 1994 volcanic eruptions.The drought  in particular  showed that people andStates throughout the world have to be partners in dealingwith the causes of disasters arising from climatic or otherforms of environmental change. The prompt and generousresponse to the series of natural disasters by our neighboursand friends in many different countries showed that theyare truly our partners in dealing with the effects of suchchanges.Like other developing countries  Papua New Guineafaces the challenge of providing its people withopportunities to improve both the material standard ofliving and the quality of life. My Government has had toaddress these multiple changes while dealing with naturaldisasters and carrying out a comprehensive programme ofstructural adjustment.In doing so  we are working hard to make sure thatprivate initiative contributes to public welfare and nationaldevelopment  as it can and should  by focusing on trimmingthe public sector so that State resources are used wherethey can be most effective.The result has been a stable economy with continuingeconomic growth. It has been achieved and is beingmaintained despite the negative impact on trade andinvestment prospects arising from the economic crisisaffecting so many of our East Asian neighbours.The lesson we draw from the experience is that theworld is truly becoming a global community. The challengewe face is to develop a global partnership â€” strong focused  and determined enough to manage and  wherepossible  to direct change. The lesson has obviousimplications for a world in which some countriesexperience â€œaid fatigueâ€  while increasing numbers ofpeople elsewhere fall and remain below the poverty line where survival itself is the most pressing issue.I know that with its small  open economy  mycountryâs development is directly influenced bydevelopments in world markets for our products. Currently my country is suffering from the economic crisisexperienced by our major trading partners  in which we areforced to undertake significant reform programmes toprotect our economy and our people.In this regard  we turn our attention to internationalfinancial institutions to help us restructure our economy.Unfortunately  we have had mixed reactions from them.Some of them  including the International Monetary Fundand the Asian Development Bank  have been verypositive in their discussions with us  while others appearto be slow in responding. This leads me to think thatsometimes some of these organizations are insensitive anddo not appreciate the difficulties and hardships faced byour people without their help.This year  despite the El NiÃ±o drought and othernatural disasters that devastated my country  Papua NewGuinea  we have continued to become more vigilant tothese challenges and to take remedial measures.Notwithstanding the hardship our economy isexperiencing because of the international economic crisis the value of our currency has consistently beenrecovering. For Papua New Guinea to realize and sustainits current reform programmes  it has to secure externalfinancial support.The challenge is to forge a new global partnershipfor change â€” a partnership in which both developed anddeveloping countries join together to address the issuesthat the global community will face in the twenty-firstcentury. This partnership will be necessary if the sharedhopes of humanity for peace  justice and a better way oflife are to progress.I see my Governmentâs foreign policy of partnershipin the Asia-Pacific as a building block for the globalpartnership on which the future depends. For developingcountries in particular  there is really no alternative way.In facing the challenge of improving both thematerial standards of living and the quality of life of ourpeople  we are carrying out comprehensive programmesof structural adjustment and changing our focus so thatboth private and State resources can be directed to socialwelfare and national development. Despite the negativeeffects of the current global crisis  we are achieving astable economy  stabilizing our currency and attractinginvestments.When my Government came into office in July1997  my priority was the resolution of the nine-year-oldBougainville conflict  which had caused terrible sufferingand the loss of lives and property. Three factors â€” thedesire of the men and especially the women ofBougainville to end the fighting  my desire for aconsensus resolution and the moral and practical supportof Australia and New Zealand â€” led to a meeting in12Burnham  New Zealand  in October 1997 where a truce wassigned.As an integral part of the truce  my Governmentapproached our friends in the region to form an unarmedand neutral regional Truce Monitoring Group. TheGovernment of the Solomon Islands â€” which played avery constructive role in the processes â€” New Zealand Australia  Fiji and Vanuatu provided personnel to the TruceMonitoring Group  and its presence helped mutualconfidence-building and made people feel safe.The peace monitoring group that took over on 1 Maythis year continues to provide a positive role in maintainingand consolidating peace. In March this year  I met inLincoln  New Zealand  with the main Bougainvillean partiesinvolved in the conflict  and we agreed that a permanentand irrevocable ceasefire should take effect from 30 April1998. Proceeding on a bipartisan-national basis and in closeconsultation with all of the major Bougainville parties  Iagreed that the State would approach the Security Councilto endorse the Lincoln Agreement on Peace  Security andDevelopment on Bougainville. I also requested that theCouncil send a small observer mission to monitor andreport on developments.As the internationally recognized representatives of allof the people of Papua New Guinea and being proud ofPapua New Guineaâs independence and sovereignty  wemade these requests with mixed feelings  but withdetermination made strong by our faith in the cause ofpeace.I am pleased to report that the Security Councilresponded positively to our request  and  through the effortsof other South Pacific Forum missions in New York andothers in close cooperation with the Secretary-General  theObserver Mission is now on Bougainville  operating side byside with the personnel of the peacekeeping mission.As I speak  my Government is making arrangementsfor a Bougainville restoration Government to take officewithin the framework of our Constitution before the end ofthis year. At the same time  the people and leaders ofBougainville are performing the traditional ceremonies ofreconciliation.Our partners from Australia  New Zealand  theEuropean Union  Japan and the United NationsDevelopment Programme are providing resources forrestoration and development. A number of non-governmental organizations  including churches  the RedCross and Doctors Without Frontiers are also active. MyGovernment is taking practical steps to strengthen civilauthority by training Bougainvillean policemen to work inBougainville.Having begun the processes of peace inBougainville  we must now do everything we can to makepeace work through peaceful means. While the peaceprocess on Bougainville is still fragile  my Government isconfident that with the support of all Papua NewGuineans and of our neighbours and friends in theinternational community  it will continue to gain strength.As it gains strength  we expect direct internationalinvolvement to become of less importance  decreasing byagreement as mutual confidence and trust consolidates.The Bougainville peace process has shown in a practicaland constructive manner how people can seekreconciliation and forgiveness.The Security Council  together with the Secretary-General  have given both moral  and through the ObserverMission  visible and practical support.On a separate though broadly related matter  PapuaNew Guinea commends the United Nations on 50 yearsof cooperation in international peacekeeping and reaffirmsits commitment to these processes. Papua New Guineamakes a resolute commitment to the principles andpurposes of the United Nations Charter. In doing so  werecognize that like any other institution  the UnitedNations has limitations. Consistent with our view of theUnited Nations as a means of promoting globalcooperation and partnership to meet the challenges ofchange in the twenty-first century  Papua New Guineacontinues in its strong belief that its moral values andorganizations offer hope to humanity.Consistent with our commitment to the UnitedNations  my Government is actively engaged in bringingour national laws  policies and practices into line with theimportant declarations and plans of action produced bythe United Nations. We give priority to implementingUnited Nations declarations and plans of action toadvance the rights of women and the elimination of childabuse.In common with the other Member countries  webelieve that it is timely to bring the United NationsCharter into line with contemporary reality by eliminatingreferences to â€œenemy Statesâ€. Papua New Guinea stronglysupports calls for a new Security Council for the newmillennium.13As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  weendorse the Declaration issued by its thirteenth Summit held in Durban  South Africa.The Security Council should be reformed andexpanded. An effective Security Council should be of a sizeand composition which matches the enhanced role that theworld expects it to play in coordinating global approachesand actions directed to deal with the issues we will all facein the twenty-first century. Consistent with the mutualrespect and equity on which partnership must be based Papua New Guinea believes that all permanent members ofthe Security Council should have similar privileges andrights.Changing the world from a system of relationsbetween imperial Powers to a partnership betweensovereign States through decolonization is among theUnited Nations greatest achievements. The process will notbe completed  as it must be  until the remaining 17dependent territories have exercised their inalienable rightto self-determination. Neither small size nor remotenessshould be allowed to qualify or limit their rights. Therecently concluded South Pacific Forum  held in Pohnpei inthe Federated States of Micronesia  has confirmed itssupport for that right.As one of the States which has always taken a closeinterest in the situation and in the rights of the indigenousKanaks of New Caledonia  Papua New Guinea is pleasedto note the progress made in implementing the MatignonAccords  culminating in the recent Agreement to theNoumea Accord.The Noumea Accord will  we believe  provide a soundbasis for the future fulfilment of all legitimate politicalaspirations. We urge all parties to honour both its letter andits spirit. The United Nations should continue to monitordevelopments in New Caledonia until implementation iscomplete and self-determination has been achieved.More than 80 per cent of Papua New Guineans live inrural villages  where they depend directly on the land rivers  lakes and sea for their livelihood. Our nationalConstitution commits us to use and develop the rich varietyof the countryâs natural resources for the common good andthe benefit of future generations. In doing so  it upholds themost up-to-date principles of international environmentallaw. The same provisions also provide a sound basis fordomestic policy and law-making.Papua New Guinea has spoken out strongly andworked actively on a wide range of environmental issues.Consistent with our record and ongoing commitment  myGovernment will shortly be signing and then ratifying theKyoto Protocol to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change. In line with theimportance we attach to such matters  Papua New Guineais party to conventions arising out of the Rio Summit onenvironment and development and Agenda 21. MyGovernment will continue to follow and support thefuture work of the Commission  including efforts totranslate and integrate internationally agreed objectivesand standards into domestic laws and programmes ofaction.Like other members of the South Pacific Forum Papua New Guinea is firmly committed to the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island States. We strongly urge its fullimplementation. Together with other States in the region we have joined as partners with distant-water-fishingnations to develop a programme to manage thesustainable use of tuna stocks in the western and centralPacific.The worldâs leading scientists have concluded thatthe rise in global temperatures poses serious threats  suchas sea-level rise and an increase in natural catastrophes such as the El NiÃ±o phenomenon.Papua New Guinea  together with the small islandStates in the Pacific  will continue to stress the urgencyfor developed countries to take a strong lead in thereduction of greenhouse gas emissions.The Kyoto Protocol has paved the way for annex Icountries to fulfil their commitments under theConvention on Climate Change and the Protocol itself.We urge those parties to translate their legally bindingtargets for the reduction of their emissions into concreteaction. While it is our firm conviction that there must bea global approach  we cannot support shifting the burdento developing countries as a precondition for theratification of the Protocol.At the recent South Pacific Forum meeting  ourGovernment  together with other heads of the SouthPacific region  confirmed our support for the SouthPacific Environmental Programme and the ForumFisheries Agency (FFA) as a key sector. The FFAprogramme will ensure the maintenance of sustainablefisheries in the region as well as enhance the economic14security of coastal States  particularly those economieswhich are highly dependent on this one resource.This is the International Year of the Ocean. PapuaNew Guinea will work actively with other South PacificMissions in New York to commemorate this Year  withparticular emphasis on the sustainable use of resourcesderived from the oceans.With its recent share of national disasters  some ofwhich have taken the ultimate human toll  Papua NewGuinea is concerned about climate change  rising sea levelsand the urgent need to reduce carbon and other emissionsin the atmosphere. Having experienced natural disasters atfirst hand  I would say that the greatest challenge for theUnited Nations is to strengthen the global communityâscapacity to respond promptly and effectively to naturaldisasters. I am sure that my friends from China andBangladesh  where large areas have recently beendevastated by floods  would agree. Papua New Guineastrongly supports the renewal of the International Decadefor Natural Disaster Reduction and preparedness and theYokohama Strategy adopted in 1993.Consistent with our shared commitment to a stable peaceful and environmentally safe world  my Governmentsupports the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We support efforts to bantransboundary movements of radioactive and otherhazardous wastes in and through our region and to ensurethat damage arising from nuclear explosions is adequatelycompensated.Together with our partners in the South Pacific Forum we recently reaffirmed our determination to maintain theSouth Pacific as a nuclear-free zone. We also expressed oursupport for the other regional nuclear-free zones  in Africa South-East Asia and the Latin American and Caribbeanregion  and the proposed new initiative in Central andSouth Asia. Like people and Governments throughout theworld  we in the South Pacific were seriously concernedabout the series of nuclear weapons tests conducted byIndia and Pakistan. The best course of action would be notonly to stop testing now but also to destroy all nuclearweapons. Papua New Guinea believes that the same shouldapply to all weapons of mass destruction in other parts ofthe world.Encouraged at the positive signs of progress towardsresolving conflicts and securing peace in several areas oftension and concern in Asia and Africa  Papua New Guineanonetheless remains anxious over recent developmentsaffecting Afghanistan  the Democratic Republic of theCongo  Eritrea and Ethiopia. We are heartened by theefforts made by the Organization of African Unity torestore peace and stability in the Great Lakes region.Also  we support the initiative of President NelsonMandela of South Africa to revive a common vision forpeace in Africa.Consistent with our commitment to peacefuldialogue between nations  Papua New Guinea condemnsthose who employ terrorism against innocent people including women and children. Diplomacy is the meansby which States join together as partners and cooperate inbringing about changes to promote peace  developmentand justice for people both in principle and  even moreimportantly  in practice. It is therefore vital that diplomatsbe able to live and work safely  free from the threat ofterrorism  such as that practised against Americandiplomats in Africa.In this connection  following recent events on ourcommon border with Indonesia  my Government wouldlike to make clear its strong and consistent recognition ofthe sovereignty of Indonesia  including Irian Jaya  and thecontinuing mutual respect in all aspects of ourrelationship.In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm Papua NewGuineaâs commitments to the United Nations Charter; tothe inalienable rights of the independent territories to self-determination  noting the Matignon and Noumea accordsfor the Kanak people of New Caledonia; the declarationto advance the rights of women and eliminate child abuse;to our determination to maintain global natural disasterpreparedness; to work actively in commemorating theYear of the Ocean; to the ratification of the KyotoProtocol on global warming; and to the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island States.Partnership in promoting change is the key toaddressing the challenges that the world will face in thetwenty-first century. I believe the challenge for theMember States is to join together to change thisOrganization for the better so that it will serve as aneffective basis for partnership  to address and resolve theissues that lie ahead."
"134",5688,"POL",53,1998,"Allow me first to congratulatethe President and wish him every success in carrying outhis responsible task. The delegation of Poland will do itsbest to assist him in his important functions.I also pay tribute to the outgoing President Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  an eminent statesman fromUkraine  a country with which we have developed good-neighbourly ties of friendship and cooperation  for hisexcellent guidance of the work of the Assembly during itsfifty-second session.I would also like to assure the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  not only of our respect and admiration but also of our continued support for his tireless efforts tomake the United Nations live up to the expectations ofthe twenty-first century and to the ideals set out in theCharter.We have a saying in Poland that is variouslyattributed to the Chinese or to the Jews — two nationswell steeped in suffering and in wisdom:“Unfortunate one  you shall live to see your dreamssatisfied.”And I  indeed  have come to experience the full measureof that truth. Ten years ago a dissident  I could barelyeven dream that I would be at the helm of my freenation?s foreign affairs  and in that role preside over theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  an organization which spans three continents inits attempt to promote security and cooperation in aconflict-torn world.And yet those 10 years ago  had I imagined thatsuch a future were possible I would probably havebelieved that a man in my position could indeed helpchange the world  make it a better  safer place. Like somany of us present here in this Hall  I had to learn thebitter lessons of the limitations of power. These lessonsshould indeed teach us humility  but not serve as an alibifor not assuming our obligations.The world today is a better and safer place than itwas 10 years ago  before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Forall the needless suffering  the agony of hunger  thescourge of ethnic hatred and war  the shame ofunderdevelopment  the evil of oppression that humanbeings had to endure in so many places on the face of theplanet — these are less than a decade ago. And even nowthe perpetrators attempt to conceal their doings  to showit is not so  and more  that suffering is contentment  waris peace  and oppression is liberty. Hypocrisy  as we allknow  is a compliment sin pays to virtue.The world is a better place because time and timeagain evil has been avoided  circumscribed or reducedthanks to preventive action taken by concerned States.This action could be something as simple as sending food20where there is none  or as complicated as over a dozennations pooling their military resources to prevent a newoutbreak of ethnic hatred in Bosnia  and helping to rebuildthat devastated nation.The world will never be the same. The world economyis currently confronted with the biggest financial challengein a half century. We note the increasing interest on thepart of politicians as well as economists in marketintervention and capital controls. Obviously  a serioussituation may indeed call for desperate remedies  but thereally serious risk to the world economy seems to lie in aretreat from free market ideals and principles.Actions to limit the spread of weapons of massdestruction are an evident reflection of efforts made toconsolidate peace and international security. Systematicprogress in the field of nuclear disarmament  apart fromimportant American-Russian and American-Chineseagreements  could become even more notable if theParliament of the Russian Federation  heeding the appealsby the international community  ratified the START IIagreements. We expect and hope that the indispensabledecision will be taken in Moscow with no further delay.We welcome the decision of the Geneva Conferenceon Disarmament to enter negotiations on a treaty banningthe production of fissile material for nuclear weapons andother nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices.This is a significant and indispensable step for the furtherconsolidation of the global regime of non-proliferation ofnuclear weapons.At the same time  we witness with concern and regretthe developments in South Asia that are so dangerous topeace and international security. Although we do notquestion the right of any nation to sovereign decisions onissues concerning its national security interests  nothing  inour opinion  justifies acceptance of the nuclear option. Thechoice of the road of nuclear armaments by India andPakistan comes as a blow to the ideals personified byMahatma Gandhi.Together with the entire international community  weaddress to the leaders of India and Pakistan an appeal torefrain from any actions that could make the situationworse in the Indian subcontinent and to join  immediatelyand unconditionally  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT).The sixteenth-century Polish humanist Jakub Przyluskiwrote:“Since man is ... more inclined to live in societythan bees  ants or cranes  an isolated life is a thingmost contrary to human nature. Man could thenneither suffice to himself  nor come to the rescue ofothers... And since nature has established some kindof affinity between us  and the same definitionencompasses all humankind  we are to consider itvile if man threatens man.”We  indeed  consider it vile if man threatens man.But it is in our nature  or at least in our better nature  tocome to the rescue of others  the more so if by makingothers more secure  our own security is enhanced.Furthermore  neighbours usually know best the nature ofthe problems affecting the neighbourhood; they aretherefore best placed to try to resolve them. That is whythe concept of collective security is becoming soincreasingly important and popular. But we must all learnthis if this Organization is to successfully negotiate thetransition into the twenty-first century. The UnitedNations has grown beyond the hopes and expectations —indeed  beyond control.Many of its specialized agencies accomplish theirimportant jobs quietly and efficiently. We have perfectrelations with many of them  especially with the UnitedNations Development Programme office in Warsaw.The Secretary-General is to be praised for his effortsto make the United Nations a better example of how theworld?s institutions could function  rather than a cartoonof the way they actually do. But he can do this only withour support. Also  we can no longer delay the reform ofthe Security Council and the General Assembly. I am sureall of us look towards these changes with some dread because knowing how wrong things could have turnedout  we cannot believe that they have been going rightuntil now. The United Nations is ripe for change.One of the most pressing issues on the UnitedNations reform agenda is the financial crisis. It is true thiscrisis is due in great part to the mismanagement ofresources and  at times  excessive spending. But at leastas much can be attributed to the deficit brought about bysome Members? refusal to pay their dues on time. True it is in large part because that pressure that a favourableclimate for change emerged within the institution itself.It has become a truism to say that peacekeeping isineffective when there is no peace to keep  and thatpeacemaking is impossible if there is no will to sustainthe unavoidable costs. But this does not mean that21peacekeeping is ineffective. A wide spectrum of examples from Cyprus to Moldova  shows that the contrary is true.But even in a successful peacekeeping operation we run therisk that we will not only keep the peace but also preservethe hatreds  envies and jealousies which were the rootcauses of the conflict in the first place. In this sense  eachpeacekeeping operation must also be one of peacemaking.Armed conflicts between States are giving way tointernal conflicts  as in Rwanda and in the formerYugoslavia. Consequently  the United Nations peacekeepingforces are being faced  in many cases  with the dilemma ofhaving to depart from the principle of non-interference inthe internal affairs of the State that is being torn apart bya civil war. We remain convinced that when a direct threatis posed to peace and security  the United Nations must beproperly equipped to discharge its role and should notremain indifferent and ignore human suffering.Poland is proud of its continuous participation inUnited Nations peacekeeping efforts  following our oldtradition of struggle “for freedom  ours and yours”. We arecurrently providing the largest contingent of troops involvedin United Nations peacekeeping operations. We areconvinced that the Organization should not allow thehighest price to be paid in terms of the lives of women andmen serving in the field under the United Nations banner.The security of people in United Nations peacekeeping andhumanitarian operations must be ensured.My country finds itself at the centre of Europeantransformation. Our aspirations to join European and trans-Atlantic political and military structures are in the processof being satisfied  fulfilling the dreams of a nation longsubject to the cataclysms of European history. But far fromturning our back on our neighbours who as yet remainoutside these structures  we indeed wish to intensify ourcooperation with them. We believe this would be conduciveto a better climate on the continent  and in the best interestsof both our neighbours and our allies.This is especially true of our cooperation with otherCentral European nations. Poland  solidly anchored incollective security and regional cooperation structures  candevelop in peace and security and substantially contributeto the development of others. If there ever was a win-winscenario  this is it.It would be arrogant and unhelpful if we believed wecould give lessons to others. But we do believe deeply thatour experience of the last decade shows that nations canmove away from authoritarianism  through negotiations —what we called round-table negotiations — to thensuccessfully build a democratic system based on the ruleof law  individual freedoms  freedom of economicenterprise and political democracy. To those  near or far who proclaim that theirs will be a different course  basedon the presumed specificity of their culture  history customs and circumstance  we say  “Please reconsider. Donot waste the creative energy of your nations in futileexperiments and grotesque performances.” This will notwork. And time is a resource none can afford to waste.But at the same time  to those who would say “Follow us  for history has proved that we are right”  —we would like to say that even among friends we candiffer. We do not believe too much in the efficacy ofpunishment and sanction. Rather  we expect that nationsneed to develop apace. We can but help them on theirway.This is best seen in the functioning of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  which my country has the honour of chairingthis year. It would be hard to imagine a collection ofnations more geographically  historically  economically culturally and politically diverse. Assuming thechairmanship of this organization for 1998  we have facedimportant questions and challenges. Can the organizationthat is the heritage of the past successfully cope with thechallenges of the future? Is it needed during a period ofboth globalization and regionalization  a period of multi-polarity  when we are striving for the universalization ofthe Earth?s civilization? Will it be able to preventconflicts and regulate inter-State relations?The Polish chairmanship started at the moment ofsignificant changes in the so-called European securityenvironment: when the Atlantic Alliance decided on itsenlargement; when a conflict erupted in Kosovo threatening South-Eastern Europe with destabilization;when the countries of Central Asia  born from theterritory of the former Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics  signalled their more intensive interest injoining the current of values that are the foundation of theOSCE; and when signs of another crisis appeared inRussia. There arose the question of how to include OSCEactivity in United Nations efforts for peace and security.We have found constructive and positive answers tomany of those questions. The organization of an all-inclusive membership of the States of the region  fromVancouver to Vladivostok  turned out to be necessary torespond to threats left by the cold war. Two priorities22came to the fore: to prevent conflicts by reaching the rootsat their early stage of appearance and to strengthen humanrights and democracy  which the OSCE calls the “humandimension”. We have also taken up the ambitious challengeof preparing a European security charter  which would helpto facilitate the functioning of cooperation in security withinthe OSCE  and would make it possible for all States regardless of their membership in alliances or othergroupings  to participate in the common effort of buildinga safe  democratic and united Europe.We want the OSCE community to have neither centrenor peripheries  neither more equal nor less equal. In manycases  as in the conflicts in Kosovo or Tajikistan  the lessonwas bitter. One of the conclusions is that in thecontemporary world  no organization can act alone. Theconsolidation of standards of civilizational cooperationwithin the OSCE must be coherent with the activity ofother organizations  in this case the United Nations  theEuropean Union  the North Atlantic Alliance  the Councilof Europe and subregional organizations such as theCouncil of the Baltic States.We need this solidarity. There I wish to comment onthe resolution adopted by the Security Council yesterdayconcerning Kosovo. It was an example of unity andsolidarity  and I hope it will send a message to stop thebloodshed in that region and stop the activities of all thosewho are trying to introduce violence  repression andterrorism there.The OSCE has been able to engage in preventivediplomacy. We have done so together; we havestrengthened our collective security together; we havefielded a host of projects in almost every imaginable sphereof human collective activity. In all fairness  one has to takeinto consideration the conflicts avoided elsewhere in theBalkans  as well as in Central Asia and in the Caucasus.We do not proclaim to be a model for others. Theorganization itself developed almost by chance  as afortuitous assembly of the members of the two cold-warblocs. But we have been able to manage the transition andto set standards that we all try to maintain. Maybe otherregions of conflicting interests could use some of ourexperience  both the successes and the mistakes.In the Middle East  we are facing a challenging anddifficult time. Poland is committed to a just  lasting andcomprehensive peace in that region. Therefore  we aredeeply concerned by the stalemate in the peace process  andwe strongly support all efforts to revitalize it  on the basisof Security Council resolutions  the principles of theMadrid Conference and the Oslo accords.In many aspects the world is now a safer and betterplace to live in than it was a decade ago. But there arenew threats and dangers. We must deter and defeatterrorist acts. Poland continues to promote the idea of theelaboration of the comprehensive convention againstorganized crime  which should generate wide and efficientcooperation between States  since organized transnationalcrime cannot be successfully suppressed by any Statealone.Borderlines are blurred. Ordinary crime blends withthe organized underworld  which in turn intermingles withthe terrorist community  and that in turn finds support andrelief in more than one of the world?s capitals. Drugs andguns are replacing more conventional currencies as theuniversal currency of evil  profits from one serving topromote the dissemination of the other  in a concertedassault on human life itself. It is indeed a culture of deathwhich seems to unite those who put guns and drugs intothe hands of the young and teach them to hate othersbecause they are of the wrong faith  race or nation. Wecannot counter that evil with the same decisiveness  hasteand cunning. We can  however  continue to support thealternative: a culture of life  founded on respect for theindividual  his inalienable rights  dignity and freedom. Interms of everyday reality  this means that the determinedeffort of all States is required to implement the basicconventions guaranteeing these values — to implementthem at home and to refuse to tolerate their violationsabroad.Of these conventions  perhaps none is moreimportant than the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  whose fiftieth anniversary we have been solemnlycelebrating. And yet  among States whose representativeshave expressed their attachment to that document  not afew deny their citizens the basic rights the Declarationguarantees. Obviously  the powerful political interestswhich lie behind such behaviour will not bow to simpledeclarations  nor will the international democraticcommunity use force to implement its values.It is our deep conviction that we should continuouslyadapt United Nations human rights machinery to presentand future developments in this area. The biggestchallenge we have been facing over recent years is theviolation of human rights in the context of armedconflicts and tensions of a domestic or civil character. Foryears the international community has not been able to23cope with this problem  although in the meantime theUnited Nations has developed a significant peacekeepingcapacity. It is only after the traumatic experience in theformer Yugoslavia and in the Great Lakes region that theapproach has changed.“No man is an island”; no State is an island.Connected  as the Polish writer whom I quoted said  by acommon definition of our humanity  we cannot help but tryto implement the noblest goal  incarnate in the name of thisOrganization: the Nations United  in our common humanity our planet and our future."
"135",5714,"PRK",53,1998,"Allow me first of all  on behalf of thedelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti  Minister for ForeignAffairs of Uruguay  on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its current session. We believe that hisrich experience and diplomatic skill in dealing withinternational affairs will lead this session to fruitful results.We also express our gratitude to the former President Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for his successful stewardship ofthe fifty-second session of the General Assembly. At thesame time  I wish to take this opportunity to express ourappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his effortsdevoted to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity.It is the wish and aspiration of humankind to make theforthcoming twenty-first century peaceful and prosperous.In this connection  we believe that working out appropriateways and means to achieve that end should be the mainfocus of the current session.The next century should be one of independence. Inorder to build a world free of all forms of domination andsubordination and to ensure equality among all countriesand nations  independence should be realized throughout theworld. Only when all Member States adhere to the Juchecharacter and the national character and firmly maintainindependence in all fields of State activities caninternational peace and security also be ensured.At the first session of the tenth Supreme People’sAssembly of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea held on 5 September this year  our people unanimously reelected with high esteem the Great Leader Comrade KimJong Il as Chairman of the National Defence Committee.The chairmanship of the National Defence Committee is thehighest post of the State  organizing and leading the workof defending the country and the destiny of the people  aswell as strengthening and increasing the defence capabilitiesof the country and State power as a whole throughcommand over all its political  military and economicforces. It is a sacred and important post that symbolizesand represents the honour of the country and the dignityof the nation.The election of our Great Leader General Kim JongIl as Chairman of the National Defence Committee is themost significant event in the sacred cause of strengtheningand developing our Republic and in achieving prosperityand happiness for all generations to come. It is a vividexpression of our people’s absolute trust in  support forand boundless loyalty to their leader.Some time ago  our people enthusiasticallycelebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. What pleasedour people most at this emotional juncture was the factthat our scientists and technicians successfully launchedinto orbit an artificial satellite  Kwangmyongsong No. 1 using a multi-stage rocket carrier developed by us in ourown way  with our own knowledge and 100 per cent ourown technology. It was the first of its kind in the country.The successful launching of our first artificial satellitewas an historic event demonstrating the might of ourscientific and technical development  and it will make agreat contribution to safeguarding world peace andenriching the store of science and technology forhumankind.In the last 50 years  the Government of our Republichas been able to safeguard the sovereignty of our country advance the socialism chosen by our people towardsvictory and defend peace on the Korean peninsula byholding fast to the Juche character and the nationalcharacter  while firmly maintaining independence in allfields of State activities.Throughout the country our entire population is nowfully determined to glorify our socialism  which is centredon the popular masses  under the banner of the Republicfounded by our Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung  thefounding father of socialist Korea. The people uphold theleadership of the respected and beloved General Kim JongIl. In the near future  the world will see the independentand peace-loving Democratic People’s Republic of Koreadevelop into a prosperous Power.The reunification of Korea and peace and security onthe Korean peninsula have long been a main area ofconcern for the international community. From theviewpoint of both the misfortune and suffering of a nation31and the peace and security of a region  the division of theKorean peninsula should not last any longer. Due to thefact that Korea has not yet been reunified  militaryconfrontation and tensions grow increasingly aggravatedbetween the United States  Japan and South Korea  on theone hand  and the Democratic People’s Republic of Koreaon the other.As a result of the present military manoeuvres againstthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on and aroundthe Korean peninsula  there is a growing danger that eitherthe twentieth century may close or the twenty-first centurymay open with another Korean war. This danger should beremoved by all possible means. In order to remove thedanger of war and ensure a durable peace on the Koreanpeninsula  the reunification of the country should beachieved without fail.Independence  peaceful reunification and great nationalunity are the three principles of national reunificationagreed upon between the North and the South. Theseprinciples were also welcomed and supported by the UnitedNations. The Government of our Republic consistentlymaintains that Korea should be reunified by means ofconfederacy on the basis of the three principles ofreunification. In April this year  our Great Leader  ComradeKim Jong Il  advanced the five-point policy for the greatunity of the entire nation as part of his continued efforts fornational reunification.The main elements of the five-point policy are theprinciple of national independence; a change in policy bythe South Korean authorities towards reconciliation andalliance with the North; dialogue for the unity andreunification of the whole nation; the promotion ofcoexistence  co-prosperity and public interests between theNorth and the South; and solidarity and coalition betweenthe North  South and the international community. TheGovernment of our Republic will spare no effort to achievethese points.We have been consistently in favour of dialogue forreunification and to improve relations between the Northand South of Korea. The North-South dialogue should beconducted on the basis of the principles of placing thecommon interests of the nation above all  removing distrustand confrontation between the North and the South andsubordinating everything to the cause of nationalreunification. No one should be allowed to use dialogue fordishonest political purposes or to perpetuate the division ofthe country. If the South Korean authorities show theirsincere desire for reunification by taking practicalactions — such as abolishing the National Security Lawand the like — we will meet with them at any time andhold dialogues and consultations to discuss the commondestiny of the nation and work together for nationalreunification.In order for the Korean people to resolve thequestions of national unity and reunification bythemselves  concerned countries  including the UnitedStates and Japan  should refrain from hindering the effortsof the Korean people. The United States Army is themain military entity in South Korea and has long been inbelligerent relations with us. This is a quite abnormalphenomenon in today’s post-cold-war internationalrelations and the product of anachronistic thinking. It isthe United States military entity and no other thatconstitutes the major obstacle in the way of theindependent and peaceful reunification of Korea. In thisforum  we once again strongly urge the United States towithdraw its forces from South Korea and to end itsbelligerent relations with us. The States Members of theUnited Nations should no longer claim to be unaware thatthe name and flag of the United Nations continue to beabused to conceal these belligerent relations.We are convinced that the most appropriate way ofmaintaining peace on the Korean peninsula is to dissolvethe United Nations command in South Korea and toconclude a peace agreement between the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States. This isour unchanging position.Japan should not hinder the cause of ourreunification by aggravating the tense situation on theKorean peninsula. Japan must discharge its responsibilityfor the Korean question by sincerely apologizing andproviding compensation for its enormous crimes againstour people  instead of attempting to declare war againstus by drawing up so-called “emergency legislation” aimed at keeping pace militarily with the United States the belligerent party with us.Recently  too  the Japanese authorities behavedunreasonably when they publicly questioned our satellitelaunch and acted rashly in taking the issue to the SecurityCouncil  insisting that it respond to our launch. This wasa flagrant mockery of the international community. If oursatellite launch is a serious security concern  Japan’ssatellite launches should be top priority for the SecurityCouncil’s consideration.32With just one year to go before the twenty-firstcentury  the United Nations is faced with the task ofbuilding a new world free from all forms of domination andsubordination. New challenges in safeguarding world peaceand security  achieving the denuclearization of the worldand ensuring social progress and economic developmentrequire the United Nations to find appropriate newmeasures.Almost all the recent attempts by a few big countries as opposed to the United Nations membership as a whole to deal with international matters have met with failure.This proves that the era of power politics and big-Powerarbitrary action ended with the cold war. The UnitedNations is now at a crossroads. It can either be dictated toby big countries or become the Organization of a new erain which the purposes and principles of its Charter aresafeguarded and fully realized. The reform of the UnitedNations should correctly reflect this reality.At present  the most undemocratic organ in the UnitedNations system is the Security Council. The currentcomposition of the Council does not represent the generalUnited Nations membership and the veto power of itspermanent members often subverts the wishes of themajority of member States.If the United Nations is to be democratized  theSecurity Council should be reformed. To this end  theexpansion of the non-permanent category should be givenprecedence  thus correcting  to a certain extent  the currentimbalance in the Council’s composition. Its workingmethods must be improved for the sake of transparency.Priority should be given to the developing countries in theexpansion of the Council’s permanent membership. AnyState that has failed to atone for its past is not eligible forpermanent membership. As for relations between theGeneral Assembly and the Security Council  the authorityof the General Assembly should be enhanced decisively.Recent events in southern Asia  witnessed by theentire world  remind us all that disarmament  especiallynuclear disarmament  should remain a priority on theagenda of the United Nations. Although several years haveelapsed since the end of the cold war  nuclear stockpilesaround the world have become more sophisticated ratherthan being reduced. When the international communitycalled for a ban on all nuclear explosive tests  the nuclearweapon States opted for subcritical tests.The proliferation of nuclear weapons cannot beprevented so long as the nuclear-weapon States pursue amonopoly of nuclear weapons. The policy of the nuclearweapon States to provide a nuclear umbrella and theirdouble standards in dealing with nuclear issues are amongthe obstacles to making nuclear disarmament a reality.The United Nations should decisively strengthen itsrole in the field of disarmament. In this regard  webelieve that there is a growing need to convene a fourthspecial session of the General Assembly on disarmament.The issue of human rights needs to be dealt withobjectively and impartially within the framework of theUnited Nations. In today’s international relations  thehuman rights issue has became synonymous withintervention in the internal affairs of other countries.Attempts to impose the values of one nation upon othersare rampant. Consequently  the rights of people to chooseand the sovereign rights of nations are being infringed.The United Nations should reject the politicization ofhuman rights and never tolerate double standards in theimplementation of human rights instruments.The twenty-first century should be devoted todevelopment and cooperation. Economic development andthe sustained growth of the developing countries shouldbecome a main theme in international economic relations.To this end  the current inequitable international economicrelations need to be redressed and the external debt issueresolved.Economic sanctions run counter to the ideal ofcooperation  are anachronistic  and only inciteconfrontation among nations. Countries that see economicsanctions as an instrument of power and authority shouldpay due attention to the fact that many people  at homeand abroad  are increasingly sceptical about and opposedto them.Globalization has caused the monetary crisis in Asia increasing the poverty and marginalization of thedeveloping countries. The United Nations should findways to meet this new challenge. It should play itsrightful role in strongly promoting the spirit of collectiveself-reliance of the developing countries and urging theimplementation of official development assistance by thedeveloped countries.The delegation of the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea appreciates the efforts of the countries of Asia Africa and Latin America to develop regional andsubregional cooperation in the spirit of collective selfreliance. We also support Syria and other Arab countries33in their just struggle to seek a fair and comprehensivesolution to the Middle East problem and appreciate theefforts of the countries of Africa to promote peace  securityand development there.I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to theGovernments  organizations and individuals of variouscountries  as well as the United Nations and governmentaland non-governmental international organizations  for theirhumanitarian assistance with the damage caused by severalconsecutive years of natural disaster in my country.The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is anindependent peace-loving State and its Governmentconsistently adheres to the fundamental ideal ofindependence  peace and friendship in its foreign policy.The Government of our Republic will develop relations offriendship and cooperation with all countries respecting itssovereignty and continue to make every effort to ensurepeace on the Korean peninsula and to safeguard peace andsecurity in North-East Asia  in conformity with thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.My delegation will contribute to the best of its abilityto the successful deliberation of all items on the agenda ofthe current session."
"136",5759,"PRT",53,1998,"It is with the greatestpleasure that I congratulate my colleague from Uruguay Didier Opertti  on his election to the presidency of thissession of the General Assembly. In his election I see therecognition of the role played internationally by theRepublic of Uruguay  an Ibero-American country and afriend of Portugal  as well as our appreciation and ourconfidence that his personal  intellectual and professionalqualities will result in success in our work.I would also like to pay tribute to the outgoingPresident  Hennadiy Y. Udovenko  for the dedicated andcompetent manner in which he steered the work of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-second session.To the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  I renew mytribute for the remarkable manner in which he has beencarrying out his difficult functions during a period inwhich the United Nations is increasingly called upon tointervene in many aspects of international life.I would like to dwell upon some questions ofparticular importance to my country  beginning with thoseof a political nature  including Africa. I recall that myAustrian colleague has already addressed the Assembly onbehalf of the 15 States members of the European Union.When releasing last April his excellent report on thecauses of conflict and the promotion of lasting peace andsustainable development in Africa  the Secretary-Generaldid not hesitate to qualify as “colossal” (S/1998/318 para. 5) the scale of the human tragedy that persists inparts of the African continent  which has been devastatedby the conflicts that have affected a number of Statessince the end of the cold war.Within its possibilities and in accordance with thehistorical  cultural and social ties that bind it to manyregions and countries of Africa  Portugal continues tomake efforts towards helping overcome those conflicts bypeaceful means and towards the promotion of economicdevelopment  social progress and good governance  whichare indispensable for their eradication. I would like tounderline the readiness Portugal has shown to participatein United Nations peacekeeping missions  particularly inAfrica. By way of example  I recall the role played byPortuguese forces within the framework of the peace15process in Mozambique  and in the ongoing United Nationsmissions in Angola  in Western Sahara and  most recently in the Central African Republic  as well as in theevacuation operations undertaken in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and in Guinea-Bissau.I must express here the very serious concern of mycountry at the situation in Angola  a country to which weare bound by so many and such deep ties. The signs ofrupture are becoming more dangerously evident in thepeace process  which has proceeded with such difficulty.The refusal by the União Nacional para a IndependênciaTotal de Angola (UNITA) to comply fully with theobligations of the Lusaka Protocol  which it freely signed with regard to its demilitarization and transformation intoa political party  and its obstruction of the normalization ofState administration contribute to the resort to militaryoptions outside the framework of the negotiated solutionsadopted by the international community.As a member of the troika of observer countries to theAngolan peace process and as one of countries thatcontributed most to the United Nations Angola VerificationMission (UNAVEM) and to the United Nations ObserverMission in Angola (MONUA)  Portugal remains committedto promoting concord in Angola in close cooperation withthe United Nations and  in particular  with the new SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  Mr. Issa Diallo whose difficult mission should be helped and supported.We are  however  fully aware of the fact that all thediplomatic efforts will be in vain if those responsible inAngola do not have an effective will for peace. TheGovernment and UNITA must assume their responsibilitiesto the Angolan people  whose right to peace  security andwell-being is legitimate and inalienable. We appeal  onceagain  for the Lusaka Protocol to be respected  and inparticular appeal to UNITA to assure immediately theProtocol?s implementation  in strict accordance with theterms that have been demanded of it by the SecurityCouncil.The gains of a multi-party system in Angola must notbe jeopardized. Its participants  particularly having endorsedpeace and national reconciliation  must not see the erectionof barriers to the respective mandates  and all must begiven the conditions of security necessary to face thereconstruction of the country.The Secretary-General deserves our full support incontinuing to promote all the necessary responses that thegravity of the situation requires from the internationalcommunity.Guinea-Bissau — a friend of Portugal with whichwe also share many varied and strong affinities — hassince June been the site of a conflict that has had gravehuman  economic and social consequences for its people.At the express request of the parties to the conflict Portugal and the Community of Portuguese-SpeakingCountries (CPLP) — which is principally made up ofAfrican countries  and has among its main goals thepolitical and diplomatic coordination of its members?policies — carried out from the start mediation effortsdesigned to stop the fighting  obtain a negotiated solutionto the conflict and bring humanitarian assistance to thepopulation of Guinea-Bissau. At no time was it possibleto doubt the legitimate intentions that led the CPLP  ofwhich Guinea-Bissau is a founding member  to respondto the request made to it. The CPLP?s interventionaligned itself with that of the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS)  eventually permittingthe signature of a ceasefire agreement between theGovernment and the military junta  which opened the wayto a negotiated settlement of the conflict.Still on the African continent  a word is also due onthe events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Wedefend unequivocally the need to respect the territorialintegrity and sovereignty of that vast country  whosestability is strategically essential to the region in which itis located. We support unconditionally the African peaceinitiatives that seek a negotiated and peaceful solution tothe complex political problems of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  which are at the heart of theconflict and cannot and should not have a solution basedon the use of force or on the presence of foreign militaryforces.Notwithstanding continued difficulties  we stillbelieve in a democratic  free and prosperous future forAfrica. We are therefore committed to bringing to fruitionthe initiative we launched in 1996 to hold a summitbetween the European Union and Africa  which is nowscheduled for 2000. We therefore welcomed withsatisfaction the decision taken by the most recentOrganization of African Unity (OAU) summit inOuagadougou to endorse that initiative.I would now like to refer to another source ofserious and justified concern for the internationalcommunity  this time on the European continent: the crisisin Kosovo  which jeopardizes peace and stability in the16Balkans and is producing heavy human losses  in terms ofdeaths  injuries  internally displaced persons and refugees.There can be no doubt as to who bears the primaryresponsibility for the eruption of the current crisis. Theadoption a few minutes ago by the Security Council of aresolution co-sponsored by Portugal is a clear signal of thedetermination of the international community and cannot beignored by those to whom it is addressed.Portugal welcomes the constructive spirit thatdominated the most recent round of ministerial talks on thequestion of East Timor  held under the auspices of theSecretary-General  whose efforts at mediation  as well asthose of his Special Representative  Ambassador Markerand his collaborators  I would especially like tocongratulate. I believe I can  for the first time  say thateffective and promising steps have been taken towardscreating the conditions to achieve a just  comprehensive andinternationally acceptable solution to this problem  with fullrespect for the legitimate rights of the East Timoresepeople  in accordance with the principles of the Charter andthe relevant resolutions of the United Nations.While safeguarding the basic positions of principle ofthe parties  it was agreed to negotiate for East Timor awide-ranging autonomy that we wish to see rest ongenuinely democratic and participatory rules for its people who  it is hoped  will progressively establish an ampledegree of self-government. It was also agreed to associatemore closely the East Timorese — whose will  freelyexpressed in accordance with their legitimate right to self-determination  will be essential to validate any definitivesolution to the question — with the process of negotiationsunder way  entrusting the Secretary-General with theresponsibility of promoting that wide consultation.It is necessary now to achieve tangible progress withregard to the more critical aspects of the situation in theterritory  such as the reduction of the Indonesian militarypresence  the release of all East Timorese politicalprisoners  including Xanana Gusmao  and the monitoring bythe United Nations of the evolution of the situation on theground.We believe that we are still at a turning point. Nothingsubstantial has yet been settled or guaranteed. That is whywe consider it essential that the international communitycontinue to follow closely the evolution of this process inits varied aspects  so that the goal of finally enabling thepeople of East Timor to enjoy a future of freedom  peaceand security is not delayed any further.In just over a year  on 20 December 1999  theterritory of Macao  currently under Portugueseadministration  will return to the sovereignty of thePeople?s Republic of China  in fulfilment of the terms ofthe Luso-Chinese Joint Declaration of 13 April 1987. Thetransition process has been carried out in a constructiveand pragmatic climate  reflecting the good relations thatexist between the two countries. We are convinced thatthis climate will persist until the end  thus guaranteeing atransfer of power conducive to the future stability andprosperity of Macao  while respecting its autonomy anduniqueness.As a short note on the question of officialdevelopment assistance  I would like to put on recordthat  according to data on 1997 recently issued by theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD)  Portugal was the donor that registered thelargest increase in this type of aid — 27.3 per cent.Within the framework of the International Year ofthe Oceans  Portugal dedicated the last World Expositionof this century — EXPO ?98 — to the theme “Theoceans: a heritage for the future”  attempting in thismanner to contribute to a progressive enlightenment ofhumanity with regard to the risks and challenges relatedto the preservation of the oceans.Still in this area  Portugal has participated activelyin various activities undertaken in the context of theUnited Nations  namely at the level of theIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO) and the Independent WorldCommission on the Oceans. In fact  Portugal was grantedthe honour of the presidency of the latter  in the person ofDr. Mario Soares  and its work led to the adoption of thereport approved in Lisbon at the beginning of this month which appeals for a democratic  equitable and peacefulmanagement of the “ocean ... our future”  and which willbe submitted to the General Assembly.Portugal is a non-permanent member of the SecurityCouncil until the end of this year. We have sought tocontribute effectively to the strengthening of the Council?sauthority and the effectiveness of its action  in accordancewith the purposes and principles of the Charter. On theother hand  increasing the transparency and democraticnature of its functioning is essential to us  allowing  inthis way  non-members to better follow the work of theCouncil.17This year  as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights  none canpurport to defend international law and legitimacy whileignoring the fulfilment of those fundamental rights.Terrorism is one of the most perverse forms of humanrights violation  and a coordinated international effort tocombat it is urgently required.I should like to mention that Portugal is a candidatefor membership in the Commission on Human Rights  fora mandate that will begin in January 2000 and that willcoincide with the Portuguese Presidency of the EuropeanUnion.In an era of globalization — of markets  information circulation of people and cultural exchange — we also havea duty to include in the international agenda theglobalization of human rights. This will be the best tributewe can pay to the Universal Declaration that was issued 50years ago."
"137",5805,"PRY",53,1998,"It is with great pleasure that I speak today  before thisesteemed forum for international dialogue  on behalf of mycountry  the Republic of Paraguay. First of all  I would liketo congratulate the President of the General Assembly andto extend to him my best wishes for success in theimportant task of guiding the work of the fifty-third sessionof the General Assembly of this Organization.I also have the pleasure to greet the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  and to extend to him  on behalf of thepeople of Paraguay  our congratulations on his excellentfulfilment of his important mission.As the century comes to an end  so does a decade thathas been for the world  and particularly for nations such asmine  a period of far-reaching and vertiginoustransformation.In 1989  after almost four decades of authoritarianrule  Paraguay regained its democracy. Since that time  agreat number of profound and dramatic changes have takenplace in the process of reaffirming our democracy  aprocess that today  I am pleased to announce  may now beconsidered definitively consolidated  since for the first timein 50 years a civilian President has transferred thepresidency of the Republic to another democraticallyelected civilian. This is an essential milestone in therecent history of our freedom and a striking testimony tothe Paraguayan peopleâs firm and irreversible commitmentto this system of government.We took over the administration of a country withmajor economic  social and moral problems  but  faithfulto the peopleâs mandate  we will make the decisions thatwe deem appropriate and fitting to reactivate oureconomy  restore international confidence in Paraguayand  finally  ensure the sustainable and equitabledevelopment of its people.This  today  is my commitment  and I will dedicateall my devotion and labour to it  though I am aware thatthis effort would be in vain without the understanding solidarity and support of my people  as well as theinvolvement and cooperation of friendly countries.In this regard  my Government has pledged to carryout a State agenda that is pragmatic and realistic. Itspriorities will include restoration of the peopleâs faith intheir leaders through transparent  coordinated actionswhose immediate effects will  in the short term  result ingreater well-being for the population. We will also carryout an all-out war against poverty by doing away with theprivileges that engender injustices and intolerableinequalities.Another priority will be a rapid economic recoverythrough the implementation of social programmes and theconstruction of an infrastructure of all-weather roads which will expedite and reduce the cost of the rapidtransport of goods produced in rural areas to tradecentres. We will also initiate programmes to provideinexpensive housing for a large sector of the population.We will give priority to the fight against crime in allits forms  focusing on the elimination of the scourges ofdrug-trafficking and the piracy and illegal appropriationof intellectual property. The concrete actions we havetaken during our first month in office have clearly shownour firmness  determination and commitment in thisregard.Another priority will be combating impunity  one ofthe ills that eats away at our society. We will beassiduous in the rigorous application of the law  which isthe inevitable framework for ensuring confidence anddevelopment  particularly against those who profit fromState resources  depriving the rest of the community oftheir legitimate chance to aspire to a better standard of7living. Exemplary measures will be adopted to addresspremeditated crimes in the economic and financial sphere.We trust that these measures  along with those for theprotection of private property and an adequate frameworkof incentives and security for foreign investment  will assistus in recovering Paraguayâs international credibility andwill bring in the flow of cooperation and investmentnecessary for our desired development.The reform of the principal organs of the UnitedNations â€” the General Assembly and the SecurityCouncil â€” is of the greatest importance to us.We have participated in the work of the WorkingGroup on Security Council reform  and once again I wishto emphasize the importance we attach to the expansion ofthe Council in both of its categories; if the number ofpermanent members is increased  the number of non-permanent members must be increased as well.This increase must include Latin America and theCaribbean and the other regional groups  without anydiscrimination.We believe that the effort undertaken by the UnitedNations with regard to item 155 on the Assemblyâsagenda â€” â€œMeasures to eliminate internationalterrorismâ€ â€” is of the greatest relevance.Paraguay vehemently condemns and rejects such actsof international terrorism as the attacks on the Americanembassies in Kenya and Tanzania.In this respect  we wish to express our conviction thatany international action to prevent and subdue terrorismmust be carried out in full and complete compliance withinternational law.Another scourge  generally related to terrorism  is thatof drug-trafficking  to which I have already referred. In thiscontext  I must add that we are convinced that this is aproblem of shared responsibilities among all countriesinvolved  producing  transit and consuming countries. Ourposition on this point was clearly stated in the Declarationof the Twelfth Meeting of Heads of State and Governmentof the Rio Group  held in Panama City.We welcome initiatives such as resolution 49/96  onhorizontal economic cooperation and other modalities forcooperation among developing countries. We must alsomention last yearâs Declaration and Plan of Action of SanJosÃ©  Costa Rica  which defines specific modalities fordealing with sectoral problems relating to cooperation inthe spheres of trade  investment  finance and business.However  we feel that the United Nations systemshould identify mechanisms  such as economic andtechnical cooperation  that will enable it to strengthenintegration more effectively  and adopt decisions aimed atproviding increased assistance. In this regard  my countrywill support such measures as will  in a more effectiveand coordinated manner  interest all participants â€”particularly private-sector participants â€” in thedevelopment process.We also endorse strengthening the United Nations toincrease efficiency within the institutions of theOrganization.If our Government programmes focus on supportingdevelopment with social justice we can give our peoplesdemocracy  freedom and respect for human rights.However  we cannot ask our peoples to fight fordevelopment  to make greater sacrifices  if they do not seesimilar trends towards change and a unified commitmenton the part of the international community.Complying with our commitments made at theSummit for Social Development  Paraguay intends toachieve the goals set there. In this regard  I am pleased tostate that the priorities of our Administration include thesocial development of the country; reduction of theunemployment rate; the eradication of poverty;preservation of the environment â€” a commitment to ourfuture generations; heeding the demands of our youth; andsupporting the advancement of women and of integratedsocieties.Based on the fundamental principle of universality the Republic of Paraguay feels that the United Nationssystem must welcome  without exception  all States thatmeet the requirements of the San Francisco Charter.Given this  and bearing in mind the elements that makeup a State as well as other essential considerations Paraguay feels that the proposed participation of theRepublic of China in the United Nations and all itsrelated bodies must be considered. This is what we woulddo with any other State that met the requirements of theCharter.I would now like to refer to one of the most importantstrategies for the socio-economic development of mycountry: its participation in the Southern Cone CommonMarket (MERCOSUR)  which is a fundamental objective ofour foreign policy. The achievements of MERCOSUR which was created in 1991 through the Treaty of AsunciÃ³n as part of the process of integration  are a matter of pridefor our four countries â€” Argentina  Brazil  Uruguay andParaguay â€” as well as for Bolivia and Chile. Theseachievements have encouraged us to renew our efforts certain that the political will that has guided us so far willlead us to achieve the goals that we have set for ourselves:to strengthen and consolidate the Customs Union and tomove towards a greater level of integration.Moreover  it is encouraging to note that the path wechose in 1991 has attracted more and more interest from anincreasingly globalized world. In this regard  MERCOSURhas shown its openness to dialogue  in particular with thesister countries of Latin America. We are not a closedcommunity  but  rather  are open to initiatives that willpromote economic  political and social cooperation. In thisspirit  we are giving particular attention to the negotiationsinitiated to establish a free-trade zone for the hemisphereand to the negotiations we intend to hold in the near futurewith the European Union.The recent crisis in financial markets in South-EastAsia and Eastern Europe  which have in turn threatened thestability of the financial markets of emerging economies are a disturbing feature of todayâs international scene. Itwas mentioned in the Declaration of the Twelfth Summit ofthe Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group  heldin Panama City  in which the position of the signatorycountries is clearly expressed.A great deal of hope has been placed in the workcarried out by this Organization. We are on the threshold ofa new millennium; the twenty-first century looms on thehorizon  rich with opportunities and challenges. Oursocieties are suffering from the crisis of the birth of a newera  a new order  because we are not all yet adequatelyprepared to confront it.Therefore  our societies demand leadership from theUnited Nations. The conclusions  recommendations andactions that may come from this Assembly could be offundamental importance for our immediate future.The problems emerging from the increase inglobalization and interdependence  as well as the dizzyingspeed with which changes are taking place in the world affecting all aspects of the human condition  force usinexorably to confront the challenge of finding the mostideal mechanisms for dialogue  understanding andeffective and united international cooperation. We trustthat the United Nations will be capable of meeting thischallenge."
"138",5824,"PSE",53,1998,"For the first time  Palestine is participating in the work ofthe General Assembly under the agenda item entitled“General debate”. That participation is a result of theresolution adopted by the Assembly on upgradingPalestine’s representation at the United Nations  which weconsider to be an essential step towards full membership.I would like  at this time  to express the deepgratitude of the Palestinian people to all Member Statesthat supported this important resolution by anoverwhelming majority. They have thus reflected the willof the States and peoples of the world for the need torealize justice for the Palestinian people in order to regaintheir international status and their seat at the UnitedNations.I would like to extend to you  Mr. President  oursincere congratulations on your assumption of thepresidency of the General Assembly at the fifty-thirdsession. I wish you complete success in your importantand noble task during these crucial times in ourcontemporary world and in our international Organization.I also extend our gratitude and appreciation toMr. Hennadiy Udovenko for guiding and presidingeffectively over the fifty-second session. I would like inparticular to praise his leadership during the resumedtenth emergency special session of the General Assemblyon illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem andthe rest of the occupied Palestinian territories.It gives me great pleasure to commend theSecretary-General of the United Nations  our friendMr. Kofi Annan  for his distinguished and wiseleadership  and I congratulate him for the many successeshe has achieved in several fields. We had the honour Mr. Secretary-General  of welcoming you a few monthsago in our country  Palestine  where you observed andwitnessed first-hand the tragedy of the Palestinian peopleand the suffering they endure as a result of the continuingIsraeli occupation of our homeland  Palestine. It is myhope that we will have the opportunity to welcome you inthe future under better circumstances: on the day whenthe occupation has been terminated and Palestine has beenrestored its freedom.As we approach the end of the twentieth century  ourworld is witnessing — and all of mankind isexperiencing — great changes and important events  fromglobalization and the problems of the internationalfinancial market to the technological revolution  satellitecommunications and the information age. All of the rapidchanges that have rocked our contemporary world requirethe necessary enhancement of our collective work withinthe framework of the United Nations. This should bedone on the basis of the purposes and principles of theCharter and for the bolstering of international cooperationin various arenas and for the acceleration of the North13South dialogue in order to establish a better world wherepeace  justice and prosperity for all mankind prevail.Many of the difficult and complicated tasks in thisregard have been forced upon us and we must deal withthem effectively. We have before us the task of economicand social development — particularly that of the countriesof the third world — solving the debt crisis and theproblems of poverty  famine  disease and migration in Asia Africa and Latin America. These challenges require theattainment of international comprehensive measures andequitable relations that are more rational and more just.Many global problems — such as terrorism  drugs epidemics and organized crime — require strengthening therule of international law  as well as the establishment of thenecessary institutions and mechanisms within theframework of the United Nations.In this connection  we also welcome the adoption ofthe Statute of the International Criminal Court  which is animportant step in the promotion of law and in putting anend to atrocities and crimes against humanity.All of these challenges and responsibilities should notprevent us from recalling that many of the basic tasks ofthe international community in our contemporary worldhave not yet been accomplished. There are peoples whostill remain under foreign occupation — including ourPalestinian people  who have been and continue to beexposed to one of the gravest injustices. This great peopledid not commit a crime; they did not commit aggressionagainst anyone nor did they occupy the land of any otherpeople. However  they were the victims of aggression.Their land was occupied and they were dispersed andcompelled by military force to a life in diaspora and exile.There are still 4 million Palestinian refugees living incamps awaiting the realization of international justice andthe implementation of resolutions of international legitimacyto accord them justice and put an end to more than half acentury of the tragedy of living in exile as refugees.It is also necessary to exert more effort to resolvemany of the regional conflicts and problems — including of course  those in the Middle East; in the Balkan region particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina; in Afghanistan andelsewhere. Special efforts and additional resources arenecessary to solve the problems of the African continent inorder to allow that great continent to move forward on thepath of development and progress. These should includeseeking to restore normal conditions in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and achieving peace and stability inthe Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa.It is also important to consider the issue of sanctionsbecause of its terrible and destructive effects on peoplesand on neighbouring States. Here I refer specifically toIraq  Libya and Sudan. While we call for solutions tothese problems and the lifting of sanctions on the basis ofthe implementation of Security Council resolutions  wecannot but express the feeling of many of us concerningthe use of double standards in implementing thisprinciple. In this regard  I would like to express oursatisfaction with the progress that has been achieved  inparticular with regard to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.Finally  I turn to an extremely important question:the question of nuclear disarmament  weapons of massdestruction and non-proliferation. While stronglysupporting the goals of the international community inthis regard  we refer in particular to the immense problemexisting in our region of the possession by Israel of suchweapons  and its refusal to accede to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and place itsnuclear installations under the supervision of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency. The small size ofour region and its nature exacerbate the dangers stemmingfrom the continuation of this situation. What occurredrecently in South Asia must encourage us all towardssincere cooperation and a commitment to the applicationof one standard with regard to this issue.In order to accomplish all of these things  we needa United Nations that is more effective. We support theefforts exerted by many States and the efforts of theSecretary-General in this regard. At the same time  wefeel and believe that our goal must go beyond reducingexpenditures  downsizing the Secretariat  streamlining theGeneral Assembly and expanding the Security Council though all of these are important issues. Our goal must gobeyond that to achieve the complete democratization ofthis global Organization. In this context  it is necessary toenhance the role of the General Assembly and also to findsolutions to the veto question in the Security Council particularly its frequent and excessive use. Transparencyand clear rules of procedure must prevail in the Council.At this juncture  I should like to remind the Assemblythat since 1973 our question has been subjected to 21vetoes in the Security Council by one of the permanentmembers of the Council  the most recent of whichoccurred in a period of less than two weeks. In short  itis necessary to secure for all Members of the UnitedNations the ability to contribute effectively on the basisof mutual respect.14Last May  the Palestinian people commemorated thefiftieth anniversary of Al-Nakba  the dispossession and thesuffering of the Palestinian people. Despite all of thesebitter years  the oldest and largest refugee question in ourcontemporary world remains unresolved  and our land stillsuffers under occupation and colonial settlement. Its naturalresources are subjected to exploitation  and the city ofAl-Quds al-Sharif is still being subjected to Judaization land confiscation  the demolition of homes  the confiscationof identity cards from its inhabitants  the imposition of acertain demographic composition and artificialadministrative measures. There is also the isolation of thecity of Bethlehem and the conflict occurring in Al-Khalil —Hebron — and the rest of the Palestinian cities. Eightmillion Palestinians are still being deprived of their right toexercise sovereignty over their land  a right that the rest ofthe peoples of the world enjoy.Despite all of this  despite the long and grave sufferingand pain  and with long and legendary steadfastness  ourPalestinian people have been able to survive and preservetheir national identity. Our people chose the peace optionand accepted the will of the international community in thisregard. Accordingly  we decided with our Arab brothers toparticipate in the peace process  which began in Madrid in1991. Then we took the well-known historical step leadingto the Oslo agreement with Israel  which was signed at theWhite House in Washington  D.C.  under the auspices ofPresident Clinton  on 13 September 1993. That developmentcarried the promise of an historic reconciliation andcoexistence between the two peoples  the prospect of a newMiddle East and the beginning of the establishment of acomprehensive and permanent peace in the region.Indeed  all parties realized tangible achievements  andthe Palestinian people were able to start building theirinstitutions and dealing with the destructive consequencesof the long years of occupation. In particular  they heldgeneral and democratic elections and established thePalestinian National Authority. Despite all of the difficultiesthat confronted the process  the general trend to forwardprogress continued  until the peace process was dealt asevere blow by the assassination of the late Yitzhak Rabin my partner in the peace process — the peace of thebrave — by an Israeli extremist. This was followed byother blows resulting from the bombings and the gravedeterioration of the living conditions of our people anddeliberate acts to destroy the peace.When the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu tookoffice in Israel  a new chapter began with its adoption ofgeneral political guidelines that were not consistent with theexisting agreements. The Government publicly tried todiscard the principles of the peace process — SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425(1978) and the principle of land for peace. It ceasedimplementation of the existing agreements with theexception of the redeployment in Al-Khalil  which wasachieved only after intensive American efforts. The IsraeliGovernment continued to prevaricate and refrained fromhonouring the obligations of the transitional period  whichare of great importance to our people  including the safepassage between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  theairport  the seaport; the release of Palestinian prisonersand detainees in Israeli prisons  and the industrial zones.Neither the first stage of redeployment  which wassupposed to begin on 7 March 1997  nor the second stage which was supposed to begin on 7 September 1997  wereeffected. Both of these  along with the thirdredeployment — the deadline for which has also beenmissed since the middle of this year — should have ledto the withdrawal of the Israeli army from 90 per cent ofour land.Moreover  this Government’s policies of economicsuffocation  closure and direct oppression of ourpeople — which costs us about $10 million a day —constitute an economic catastrophe. The Government hascontinued with the intensification of settlements and theJudaization of Jerusalem  the isolation of Bethlehem andthe old city of Al-Khalil  and the disapproval of theoperation of the Palestinian airport  safe passage industrial zones and the seaport  in order to escalate thesuffocation and siege of our people and to destroy thepeace process.All of these policies and positions adopted by theGovernment of Mr. Netanyahu have caused the currentdangerous situation and the complete stalemate in thepeace process on the Palestinian track  as well as on theSyrian and Lebanese tracks  which have been completelystalemated. These policies and positions have alsoengendered the general tension prevailing in the regionand the danger of descending into complete chaos. Thewhole world has expressed grave concern at this and hascalled upon the Israeli side to change its policies andpositions and to comply with the bases of the peaceprocess and implement the existing agreements.It is high time for the international community  inadherence with international law and in service to peace to effectively and tangibly pressure the Israeli side torealize the goals of peace  security and stability — notonly in the Middle East but internationally. This meansimplementing the agreements that were signed at the WhiteHouse under the auspices of President Clinton by theRussian Federation  the United States of America  theEuropean Union  Norway  Egypt and Jordan and in thepresence of Japan. It means implementing Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and theprinciple of land for peace  which were the bases of theMadrid Peace Conference.With the hope of halting the deterioration of theexisting situation  the Palestinian side  in cooperation withmany of the concerned parties  has recently sought tointensify efforts  particularly with the help of the UnitedStates co-sponsor — and especially with the help ofPresident Clinton  to whom we express our gratitude. Theseefforts resulted in the United States initiative  containing allof the important pending issues  that was submitted to theparties concerned. As delegates are aware  the Palestinianside accepted this American initiative despite the fact thatit did not meet our minimum just and legitimate demands.But the Israeli side still rejects this initiative and continuesin its attempts to undermine it and pre-empt its contents.President Clinton  thankfully  sent Secretary of StateAlbright and Mr. Dennis Ross  who have made great effortsto move the peace process forward and protect it.Despite all these efforts  the Israeli Government hasnot responded. Hence  we call upon the United States cosponsor to announce its initiative and to publicly andclearly put the onus on the party that is impeding peace.We also call upon the United States to continue to workeffectively in a manner consistent with its responsibilitiesto the peace process and with its interests and credibility inthe Middle East region  and so as to protect the region fromthe dangers emanating from the destruction of the peaceprocess.This morning  President Clinton graciously took animportant step to save the peace process and to move itforward by convening a meeting at the White Housebetween the Palestinian and Israeli delegations. This was animportant meeting to promote and preserve the peaceprocess  and we thank President Clinton for that particularly as the efforts of the United States will continueto move the process forward and promote theimplementation of the signed agreements.In this context we call upon the other partiesconcerned  particularly the Russian Federation in itscapacity as one of the two co-sponsors of the peaceprocess  as well as China and Japan  to activate andintensify their efforts. We also call upon the EuropeanUnion  with its economic and political interests andcapabilities  to move quickly and effectively to salvageand safeguard the peace process. In this same vein  wecall upon all Member States to support the FrenchEgyptian initiative to convene an international conferenceof all States determined to save the peace process fromthe dangerous crisis it has reached.We have not lost hope for the peace process  and wewill continue to honour our obligations in accordancewith the existing agreements. At the same time  we willnot give up on the necessity of Israeli compliance withthose agreements and the need for the Israelis to fulfiltheir pending obligations. We will not give up ourinalienable national rights — the inalienable nationalrights of the Palestinian people.At this stage  I wish to extend  on behalf of thePalestinian people  our deep gratitude to all the donorcountries and to the World Bank for their valuablecontributions aimed at alleviating the suffering of ourpeople and at assisting them in building and developingtheir homeland and at achieving meaningful economic andsocial development. I reiterate our gratitude to thesecountries and the World Bank  particularly because theyare contributing despite the obstacles and impedimentsimposed by Israel in this regard.It is so difficult to separate the United Nations fromthe question of Palestine  for this internationalOrganization has been dealing with our cause since itsinception. It was the United Nations which partitionedPalestine  and to this time it has not ceased to deal withthe results of the events that followed  with the repeatedand increasing injustices perpetrated against our people for which no remedy has yet been found. Whilereaffirming the permanent responsibility of the UnitedNations for the question of Palestine  we appeal to all ofyou to enhance your solidarity and support for our peoplein the coming period  through these critical circumstances on the basis of respect for the principles of the UnitedNations Charter  international law and internationalhumanitarian law.We expect that the Conference of the HighContracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention of1949 will be convened before the end of this year onmeasures to apply the Convention to the occupiedPalestinian territory  including Al-Quds al-Sharif  inaccordance with the recommendations made repeatedly bythe tenth emergency special session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations.16In this context  we also expect Israeli participation inthe work of the fifty-third session of the Assembly to be inconformity with international law  thus ensuring that Israelicredentials do not cover those territories determined by theSecurity Council and the General Assembly  since 1967  asoccupied Palestinian and Arab territories  includingoccupied East Jerusalem. This is a matter on which there isa consensus by the international community.From this venue  I would like to call upon all of you the source of international legitimacy and peacemaking  theguardian of freedom  security and stability and the sourcefor the achievement of justice and prosperity forhumankind  to stand by our people  especially as the fiveyear transitional period provided for in the PalestinianIsraeli agreements will end on 4 May 1999. Our peopledemand that we shoulder our responsibilities  and theyawait the establishment of their independent State. Thisindependent Palestinian State must be established as anembodiment of the right of our people to self-determination.I assure you that our people will continue to pursue andprotect the peace of the brave in the Middle East. Weappeal to you to continue your support for us  as always inthe decisive moments of the history  the present and thefuture of our people. Help us to achieve the national goalof our people in the establishment of their State.It is not admissible for Israel to continue dominatingthe Palestinian people. Everyone is aware that 100 per centpeace means 100 per cent security and 100 per centfreedom. One hundred per cent freedom. I repeat — 100per cent peace  100 per cent security and 100 per centfreedom. One hundred per cent freedom. If the IsraeliGovernment wants reciprocity  I declare from this podiummy demand of them for mutual compliance with the signedagreements  especially in the fields of security and theprotection of Palestinians and Israelis against all forms ofviolence and terrorism and its sources. I invite the IsraeliGovernment to engage in common  serious work betweenus to address that. There is no alternative to peace. Help usto achieve it.In the year 2000  the past and the future will meet inPalestine  joined by a global vision of hope and peace forall peoples of the world. On that occasion  the world willcelebrate the second millennium of the birth of JesusChrist — peace be upon him — and the beginning of anew millennium. It is a religious and spiritual occasion ofgreat importance not only for the Palestinian people and theregion  but also for all the believers in the world  as well asfor the entire international community. The Palestinianpeople have actually begun serious preparations to celebratethis important religious  historic and internationaloccasion  with the cooperation of many religious  politicaland social institutions concerned. We call upon you tojoin us in bearing the responsibility of these preparations and we invite you to participate directly in theforthcoming celebrations to start together  God willing  anew march.In this regard  we appreciate the addition by theGeneral Assembly of a new item on its agenda entitled“Bethlehem 2000”. We also extend our thanks to theChairman and members of the Committee on the Exerciseof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People fortheir initiative in this regard. I also take this opportunityto thank its sister Committee  the Special Committee toInvestigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rightsof the Palestinian People.I look forward to speaking to you once more whenPalestine will have taken its natural place in thecommunity of nations  as an independent State  and whenpeace will have prevailed in the land of peace and in theentire Middle East."
"139",5870,"QAT",53,1998,"I would like at theoutset to extend sincere congratulations to Mr. Opertti onhis election as President of this new session  the fifty-thirdsession of the General Assembly. I wish him every successin presiding over its meetings and conducting its work.Also  I cannot but extend heartfelt thanks toMr. Opertti's predecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko  theMinister for Foreign Affairs of friendly Ukraine  for theefforts he expended during his presidency at the fifty-second session. I wish him success in his futureendeavours.Here we come again to this universal forum  to meet discuss and debate questions that concern our nations andpeoples. This has become more necessary and pressing thanever before. The world in which we live today  and inwhich  God willing  future generations will live  has grownsmaller in terms of geography and time  but to our greatregret its problems and crises are still as great and ascomplicated as ever. They have even become greater andmore complicated as a result of their interconnectednessand interrelated nature and the interactions among theirramifications and effects.We cannot but wonder  while sitting here within theframework of this universal  international organization about the events and developments that occurred in ourworld during the past year and about those emergingquestions and crises that call for our utmost attention. Havewe managed to take steps towards the better world we seekfor our countries and peoples? Have we succeeded insettling any of the bloody conflicts or in pacifying anyregion fraught with tension and any of the chronic hotbedsof tension in the network of regional and internationalrelations? Has democracy flourished and have human rightsbeen consolidated? Have we dealt with the problem ofterrorism and succeeded in eliminating its causes andmanifestations? How far have we gone in our efforts tocombat the devastating scourge of drugs? And to whatextent have we achieved the aspirations to put an end topoverty  misery and unemployment; to find humanitariansolutions to the phenomenon of migration and the massflow of refugees; to eliminate international organizedcrime syndicates; to prevent the proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction in general  and nuclear weapons inparticular; to halt the arms race; and to devote moreresources and energy to programmes of development education and welfare? These are major questionsconcerning urgent issues and problems that call for ourutmost attention and efforts in order to attain these long-awaited solutions and remedies.During the past months  we have all followed thedevelopments of the economic and monetary crises thathave engulfed the States of South-East Asia and the FarEast. We have seen how these developments have ledthese States to stagnation  inflation and social sufferingafter they had been models of prosperity and rapid growthfor the world.Also  we are still following with grave concern theeconomic and financial upheaval experienced by theRussian Federation  to whose new Government I wouldlike on this occasion to wish success in its efforts to copewith this turmoil and to extricate the country from thedifficulties it is facing.Naturally  we are concerned at the prospect of theextension of the adverse consequences of these turbulenteconomic conditions to other States and regions of theworld that have been relatively free from them so far.This brings us to the repercussions of all of this on theeconomies of our States in the Gulf region and theMiddle East  especially in the light of the drop in theworld oil prices and the decline of the revenue earnedfrom this vital commodity on which the producing andexporting States are primarily dependent to implementtheir programmes and attain their developmentaspirations.If these developments prove one thing  it is theextent to which organic interdependence and interrelationhave come to characterize the economies of the world control its markets and define the constantly fluid relationbetween its producers and its consumers. This  in turn prompts us to deal with these monetary and economicconditions from a global  open perspective free fromisolationism and narrow-mindedness. It is also incumbentupon us to make the necessary efforts to cope with thepresent crisis on the basis of international partnership social justice and developmental and monetary balance and to prevent it from worsening and becoming  Godforbid  a worldwide economic recession. If this were tohappen  it would have extremely adverse political  social28and economic effects with unpredictable consequences forus all.We speak about global concerns and questions  butregional crises and conditions have not been any betterduring recent months. The peace to which we have aspiredin our region is still  to our great regret  an elusive mirage.It is indeed very distressing  even enraging  for one to seethat several years of negotiations  endeavours and mediationhave failed  so far  to bring the peace process in the MiddleEast to its desired objective: the achievement of acomprehensive  just and lasting peace based on theprinciples of international legitimacy  on the resolutions ofthis world Organization which is hosting our current debate and on the basis of security  stability and mutualrecognition among all nations and peoples of the region.It is also regrettable that the peace process has notexperienced any positive development since the coming intooffice of the present Government in Israel; rather  it hassuffered a serious setback. At a certain time there werehopes and expectations that the Middle East was on theverge of a genuine peace allowing everyone to live insafety and tranquillity  and to enjoy equal rights. The hopewas that the wars that had set the region ablaze and hadbled it for so long would come to an end  to be supersededby a process of development  cooperation and prosperity.In the light of those hopes  a series of economicconferences related to the peace process was launched  thelast of which was the Al-Doha Conference  after whichthese conferences came to a halt. This is indeed a reflectionof the situation which the peace efforts reached and thedifficulties that have faced and are still facing these efforts.The essential problem facing the peace process  in ourview  is the fact that Israel  under its current Prime Ministerand its hard-line Government  has reneged  and is stillreneging  on the principles which originally formed thebasis for the peace process  and on the accords concludedin the framework of that process between the former IsraeliGovernment and its Arab neighbours.Here  I would like to remind the Israeli Governmentthat the peace process was based on the implementation ofSecurity Council resolutions  especially resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973)  regarding the need for withdrawalfrom the Arab territories occupied in 1967  and resolution425 (1978) regarding southern Lebanon and the LebaneseBekaa. This process was also based on the principle of landfor peace and the attainment by the Palestinian people oftheir legitimate rights. We view all of these principles asinternational obligations  which Israel  as a State Memberof the United Nations  must honour and abide by.In this regard  allow me to depart from the text ofmy statement to say how fervently I wish that PrimeMinister Netanyahu had been sincere in his statementyesterday  when he claimed he was as interested inproviding security and peace for Palestinian children as hewas for his own children. However  the bitter reality withwhich we are all familiar says otherwise. SinceMr. Netanyahu took office  his Government has beenpursuing a policy contrary to the objectives and the spiritof the peace process in the region. His failure toimplement the accords signed with the Palestinian sidehas worsened the suffering of all segments of thePalestinian people  including the Palestinian children whosuffer harsh living conditions where they lack theminimum basic requirements of life in education  healthand nutrition. I wish Mr. Netanyahu had informed us ofthe future awaiting these children  who are chafing underthe effect of the economic embargo imposed on them byhis own Government.In this context  I have to underline the tragicconditions of the Palestinian people under occupation andthe daily arbitrary practices they suffer at the hands of theIsraeli forces  as if they had not suffered enough from1948 until the present day. Here  I would like to singleout in particular settlement activity  the confiscation ofland  the demolition of houses and the driving of wholefamilies out of their homes. All of this should strengthenour resolve to intensify efforts towards achieving a justsolution that would restore to the Palestinian people theirlegitimate rights  including their right to establish theirindependent State  with holy Al-Quds as its capital  andsecure the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupiedArab territories in the Syrian Golan  south Lebanon andthe Lebanese Bekaa in conformity with United Nationsresolutions and the principles of international legitimacy.This would make it possible to speak of genuine peace inthe region on a just  comprehensive basis and on the basisof mutual respect and security for all.I would also like to indicate that the decision by theIsraeli Government on 21 June 1998 to expand themunicipal limits of the city of Jerusalem  which wouldalter the legal status of the Holy City  is a directcontravention of the relevant resolutions of the SecurityCouncil and the General Assembly. Moreover  such a stepcontradicts the accords concluded between the Israelis andthe Palestinians and violates the basis of the peaceprocess which provides for deferring the question of29Al-Quds so that it would be agreed upon in the permanentstatus negotiations. Therefore  we express our support forthe presidential statement issued by the Security Council on13 July 1998 in response to the Israeli action. The Councilcalled upon Israel to refrain from executing its plans andfrom taking any action that would prejudice the outcome ofsuch negotiations or pre-empt the accords that they mayresult in. The statement also calls upon Israel to complyscrupulously with its legal obligations and responsibilitiesunder the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection ofCivilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.I would also like to place on record our satisfactionwith the result of the voting at the 89th meeting of theGeneral Assembly?s fifty-second session  on 7 July 1998 which resulted in granting Palestine  in its capacity asobserver in this international body  additional rights andprivileges of participation in the sessions and work of theAssembly. We view this step as a simple rehabilitation anda modest step towards endorsing the membership ofPalestine and its legitimate position in the framework of theUnited Nations and its institutions  in the hope that the daywill come when  God willing  we will see the Palestinedelegation representing a State admitted as a full-fledged active member in this universal  international organizationin the near future.The consolidation of peace and security  theenhancement of the principles of mutual confidence andgood neighbourliness  the peaceful settlement of allconflicts and disputes through dialogue and peaceful means and commitment to the principles of international law arethe foundations of the policy of my country  Qatar  vis-à-vis our neighbours. That is why we consider the questionof security and peace in the Gulf region and the MiddleEast a vital question of the highest priority for us and forour brothers in the Gulf Cooperation Council. From thisperspective  we call for the settlement of the disputebetween our sister State  the United Arab Emirates  and thefriendly Islamic Republic of Iran over the islands of AbuMusa  Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb through bilateraldiplomatic efforts or  if need be  by resorting tointernational arbitration. This would contribute to theevolution of Gulf-Iranian relations.On another level  the Iraqi crisis  in its turn  has beenunresolved for years and there are no signs on the horizonof an impending  appropriate solution to it. With thepersistence of this situation in Baghdad  which could eruptat any moment  and with all its potential for destabilizingthe entire region  the condition of the Iraqi people hasreached tragic proportions under the effect of theinternational sanctions that have been imposed upon thecountry for years. Whether or not we are convinced of theusefulness of these sanctions in achieving their envisagedobjectives  and while we fully assert the need toimplement all relevant Security Council resolutions  wewould also express the hope that the embargo imposed onthe Iraqi people will be lifted in order to mitigate theharsh suffering it has caused and the adverse effects it hashad on these people.We view with concern the tense situation in theneighbouring region of the Horn of Africa  where Statesand people have suffered numerous tragedies andhardships as a result of border and civil conflicts andwars. These have resulted in the squandering of resourcesand potentials and aggravated the phenomena of poverty starvation and migration.I would like to single out the Republic of the Sudan the suffering of whose people  we hope  will end in amanner that preserves its territorial integrity and the unityof its people. We also hope that all differences among theStates of the region will be settled by peaceful means andon the basis of international legitimacy  so as to ensurecooperation and good-neighbourliness among all Statesand peoples.Furthermore  we in the State of Qatar feel that thelifting of the embargo and sanctions imposed on the sisterLibyan Jamahiriya is a basic and popular demand especially in the wake of recent positive developments inthis matter. In this regard  we would express our hope andconfidence that the efforts currently under way will resultin a judicial and diplomatic formula satisfactory to allparties to this question and put a definitive end to itsrepercussions. This would ensure the lifting of theembargo and the sanctions imposed on Libya and closethe file on the Lockerbie question  while doing justice toall parties concerned.In the same vein  and proceeding from the strongattachment of the State of Qatar to the principle of thepeaceful settlement of disputes and from its profoundbelief in the necessity of consolidating security andstability and avoiding the dangers of war  hostilities andclashes of any kind  I wish to express our great concernover the regrettable events unfolding in Afghanistan andthe escalation of tension along its borders with Iran.While stressing our conviction that the best means tosolve the Afghan crisis in its various aspects lie in thediplomatic good offices which are proceeding under thesupervision and auspices of the United Nations  we appeal30to the parties concerned to desist from any action to furtherescalate the conflict or widen its scope.Moreover  I cannot but touch upon the tragedy of thepeople of the Kosovo region  which is now suffering thesame civil conflicts  “ethnic cleansing” and mass migrationthat have plagued other peoples of the former Yugoslavia.While thanking the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his tireless efforts andinitiatives to defuse tensions and settle conflicts throughoutthe world  we call upon him once again to continue andredouble his efforts to end these conflicts and prevent theirexpansion and escalation  especially in Kosovo Afghanistan  Iraq and Africa.The crises and conflicts I have cited are but examplesof the magnitude of the challenges and tasks which wemust face. There are many thorny questions andcomplicated problems to which all of us  the inhabitants ofthis planet  regardless of our different races and beliefs must work together to seek solutions  for the sake of ourfuture and that of our children and grandchildren.Foremost and most serious among these is thequestion of the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  including chemical  biological and  especially nuclear weapons. A few months ago  we  like the entireworld  were shocked by the disturbing developments arisingfrom the exchange of nuclear-weapons tests by India andPakistan and by their inherent threat of unleashing aconventional and nuclear arms race between those two largeneighbours. Here  I would like to recall the position of mycountry on such tests: We call for the exercise of wisdomand the prompt signing by all States  without exception  ofthe treaties banning nuclear tests and limiting theproliferation of these weapons of mass destruction  whileearnestly seeking to reduce the number of such weapons inthe world in preparation for their complete elimination. Thisis specifically what we would like to see in our region which  I emphasize  we would wish entirely free ofweapons of mass destruction  especially nuclear weapons.In this regard  I would point out that Israel is the onlynuclear-weapon State in the region and the only State thathas so far refused to sign the treaties relevant to theprohibition of such weapons and the prevention of theirproliferation. If it persists  this situation will lead to tensionand the repercussions arising from the imbalance of powerit causes. Therefore  in our view  it is necessary andimperative to take concrete steps to eliminate these weaponsfrom the region  so as to avoid the risks of launching anarms race that would further destabilize the region.The State of Qatar also signed the Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction  which was concluded in Oslo. We signed itofficially in Ottawa last December  prompted by ourbelief in the correctness of banning these mines and ourawareness of the many humanitarian tragedies resultingfrom their use  especially among innocent civilians in thewake of the wars during which they had originally beenlaid.Other worldwide scourges  which we have long seenproliferate and expand  are no less serious than weaponsof mass destruction in terms of their devastating andcomprehensive effects on the peoples and States of theworld. Drugs  organized crime  famine and the disruptionof environmental and climatic conditions have all becomeglobal threats. We sincerely believe that it is impossibleto tackle these threats except through comprehensiveinternational endeavours and programmes.In this regard  I would like  on behalf of myGovernment  to thank and congratulate the friendlyGovernment of Italy and the delegations of the world thatparticipated in the United Nations Diplomatic Conferenceof Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of anInternational Criminal Court  which was held in Romelast June and July. It culminated in a declaration on theestablishment of this Court  the jurisdiction of which willinclude trying those responsible for acts of genocide andwar criminals.I would also like to refer to the twentieth specialsession of the General Assembly devoted to counteringthe world drug problem  held in this Hall early last June.It showed us the magnitude of this intractable problemand its serious effects on all people of the world withoutexception. My Government would like to thank thefriendly Government of Mexico for taking the initiative ofproposing to the General Assembly the convening of thespecial session in order to draw up a comprehensiveinternational strategy  under the auspices of the UnitedNations  to cope with this problem  which threatenseverybody.The need to protect and conserve the environmenthas become a pressing question that requires all of us  aspeoples inhabiting this planet  to devote greater effortsand resources to addressing it in a framework ofcoordination and cooperation on a comprehensiveinternational level and in the context of the assumption byeach of us of his own responsibilities and duties. There is31no doubt that the environment today has been severelydamaged by the faulty policies and practices still pursuedby some industrial States and institutions. This damage isalso a result of mankind?s age-old neglect of andindifference to its surroundings. However  the time has nowcome to undertake a coordinated and serious universaleffort to put an end to these abuses and practices  whichclearly threaten the future of the globe and all its peoplesand regions with a potential calamity.The right of man to live in dignity and freedomremains. For the Government and the people of Qatar it isa sacred divine right  which we must all respect andprotect. Unfortunately  we cannot confirm that human rightsand man?s freedom to live in dignity and security areprotected and available everywhere in today?s world. Thereare still numerous disturbing exceptions and violations inmany regions and States of the world. Fortunately however  we are witnessing significant progress towardssubstantial recognition of these legitimate human rights  ofgreater political  social and cultural democracy and ofhumanitarian and civilizational openness.It is our sincere hope and desire that that progress willbe consolidated and strengthened throughout the world. InQatar  we are especially proud that  under the auspices ofHis Highness the Prince Sheikh Hamad bin KhalifaAl-Thani and under his instructions  vital pioneering stepsare being taken to achieve more democracy and toconsolidate participation by all segments of the populationthrough the exercise of responsibility and freedom ofchoice  the guarantee of social and civil rights and civicduty  and respect for freedom of opinion  of speech and ofthe press within the framework of the laws and the idealsand values in which we believe and which we cherish.As we stand today at the threshold of a new centurywith its attendant rapid and continuous changes transformations and surprises and face the growing numberof tasks and the greater challenges they impose  we arefirmly convinced of the need for readiness and preparednessto meet these challenges  undertake the tasks assigned to usand shoulder our responsibilities in a spirit of cooperation coordination  friendship  mutual respect and commonalityof interest for the benefit of our countries and peoples.Proceeding from our deep faith in God Almighty  thisis the least we can do for ourselves  our countries and ourpeoples and for our one world. Our responsibility to thefuture generations dictates that we must provide for them abetter world  a better life and a better future. May Godguide us."
"140",5916,"ROU",53,1998,"Itgives me particular pleasure to congratulate Mr. Operttimost warmly on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session. Please allow me also tojoin those who have expressed their appreciation for thework done by the former President  Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  during the past session.Since this is the first time that I am taking the floor inthis Assembly  I would like to express to Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan our highest consideration and support for hisactivity  especially for his efforts in promoting reform ofand a new image for the United Nations.Romania believes that the role of the United Nationsin contemporary international life remains essential  giventhat  in the face of the new challenges to internationalsecurity  we can react in a coherent and efficient manneronly under the guidance of a unique system of values  suchas that of the generally accepted principles of the UnitedNations Charter  whose validity remains indisputable.My country desires to participate actively in theprocess of redefining the role of the United Nations and ofmodernizing its functioning  and it supports the reform ofthe Organization as a whole.The beneficial role of United Nations preventivediplomacy  demonstrated these past years  as well as thenew approaches regarding humanitarian aid  peacekeepingand post-conflict reconstruction  are eloquent examples ofthe usefulness of joint  coordinated action at the globallevel. Romania is actively involved in promoting theseconcepts and trends and is participating  to the extent of itscapacity  in peacekeeping and peace-building operations.The participation of Romanian soldiers in United Nationspeacekeeping missions in Bosnia  Angola  Kuwait  Somaliaor Rwanda represents our contribution to theimplementation of these concepts.The political will of Romania to act as a factor ofstability on the international level was proved once moreyesterday when we signed a memorandum ofunderstanding with the United Nations regarding stand-byarrangements. This event  furthermore  supplements therecent accession of Romania to the Multinational UnitedNations Standby Forces High-Readiness Brigade(SHIRBRIG). The experience acquired in peacekeepingoperations has highlighted the need to consolidate UnitedNations rapid reaction capacity.Romania is profoundly concerned about the conflictsituations on the agenda of the Security Council andwould like to take this opportunity to advocate  oncemore  dialogue among the parties concerned  in order tofacilitate solutions negotiated by those directly involvedin the conflict.It is essential not to lose the momentum for dialoguelikely to lead to peace  because there is always a rightmoment for peace  just as there is also sometimes unfortunately  a time which can lead to conflict. Forexample  in our view the Middle East today is facing aunique chance for peace. If the parties involved do nottake advantage of this opportunity  the crisis mightcontinue indefinitely. Let us do our utmost to avoid anunfortunate “too late” situation. We were on the verge ofacting too late in Bosnia  in Northern Ireland  and we stillrun this risk in Kosovo.The evolution of the crisis in Kosovo remainsextremely worrying. Romania continues to stand for thepeaceful settlement of this conflict  and we support theefforts of the international community in this direction including those of the Contact Group  the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO)  the European Union  theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) and the Council of Europe. Beyond all doubt  thecountries in the region must be constantly consultedregarding measures that are to be taken for the settlementof the conflict.The Balkans and  in a broader sense  South-EasternEurope have  inter alia  an image problem. The inventoryof local disputes gets more attention than the inventory ofreal success stories. We forget that a number of thesecountries have managed to make the transition fromdictatorships and centralized economies to democraciesand market economies. It is a difficult process but onecourageously undertaken by these countries. It is true thatit is always up to them to improve their politicalimage — not by falsifying it  but on the contrary byrendering it more exact. There is the need for a certainregional pride  for a legitimate aspiration to show the14world not only the spectre of intraregional conflicts  butalso a promising economic and cultural potential thatdeserves every consideration and encouragement.Romania is particularly concerned about the stillunresolved conflict situation in the eastern region of theRepublic of Moldova. We believe that there are seriousreasons for concern about the lack of progress in solvingthe two major problems of this region — namely  thewithdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of theRepublic of Moldova  and the negotiation of the politicalstatus of the eastern region of the Republic of Moldova. Wesupport the need for the resumption of negotiations on thestatus of this region and the urgent implementation of the1994 agreement on the withdrawal of the 14th RussianArmy from the territory of the Republic of Moldova.We believe that the United Nations Security Councilwill continue to play a crucial role in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. We support the reform ofthe Council and want to have the discussions continued onequitable representation in the Council and an increase inits membership  with a view to finding generally acceptablesolutions. Our approach is also aimed at obtaining anadditional non-permanent seat for the Group of EasternEuropean States.In the context of increasingly diverse challenges tointernational security and the prevalence of non-militaryrisks  the role of the United Nations in other fields —economic  social and legal — is becoming more importantthan ever. The economic and social dimensions of UnitedNations activities offer even more opportunities for acoherent and efficient management of dialogue andcooperation on global economic and social issues.The high-level dialogue which recently took place inNew York on the economic and social impact ofglobalization re-emphasized the need for a coordinatedapproach to economic interdependence and otherdimensions of international security. An effective responseto the present challenges requires the participation of allStates  as well as international financial and commercialinstitutions  in order to reach a new global financialbalance.In a world of growing interdependence  the assistanceprovided by the United Nations system is a good exampleof the coordinated way in which we can address the variousproblems confronting us. Romania is developing effectivecooperation with the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP)  the United Nations Children?s Fund(UNICEF) and other funds and programmes within thenew United Nations development assistance framework.The Romanian Government would like to benefit morefrom United Nations assistance in priority fields insupport of domestic reforms.This year  the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives me thisvery pleasant opportunity to refer to the human dimensionof our activity. It also provides us all with an opportunityto reflect more broadly upon the interdependencies whichexist between human rights and peace  development anddemocracy.Romania supports the role played by the UnitedNations in asserting the universal nature of human rightsand in consolidating the international system for theprotection of these rights in collaboration withGovernments and civil society.We also wish to contribute to an active and efficientUnited Nations involvement in the fight against terrorism organized crime and illicit drug-trafficking. In thisrespect  we must take into account the fact that the globalcharacter of these new threats requires a global approachso that mankind can tackle them in a responsible way.We cannot afford the luxury of replacing effective actionby endless debate or compassion by contemptuousjudgement.We should condemn terrorism without speaking ofterrorist peoples or countries. We should condemnfanaticism without claiming that there are fanatic religionsor denominations. We should encourage dialogue and notconfrontation  solidarity and not segregation. We have towork for the unity of Europe without instituting variousdegrees of “Europeanism”  which could lead to arbitrarydivisions that separate and exclude rather than unite. Wehave to encourage the spirit of cooperation and mutual aidand not the tendency to pass judgement on others. Weshould not judge States for the undignified deeds ofcertain citizens  nor peoples for the historic accidentsimposed on them by abusive leaders or barbarianideologies. We should also refrain from condemning thosewho have different views from ours and should not usethe name of democracy to encourage confusion betweenpublic affairs and private  between the values of pompand sincerity  between honesty and demagogy. We should15not add to the confusion of the world by an ostentatiousrelativization of acquired traditions and values.In this context  Romania reaffirms its attachment tothe concepts of multiculturalism and tolerance of all kinds.Allow me to recall that an international conferenceorganized by the community of Sant?Egidio was recentlyheld in Bucharest on the topic of peoples and religions.Representatives of all the major religions anddenominations of the world participated in this meeting. Asmentioned in the message of Pope John Paul II  the successof the meeting testified to Romania?s mission as “aninterface between East and West  offering a genuinesynthesis of cultures and traditions”.At present  many countries of the world areundergoing the complex and unique experience of regainingdemocracy. That is why there is great interest in goodgovernance  strengthening democratic institutions andenlarging the participation of civil society in the exercise ofdemocracy.It gives me great pleasure  in my capacity as ActingChairman of the Third International Conference of New orRestored Democracies  to bring to the Assembly?s attentionthe fact that the ministerial meeting of the countriesparticipating in that Conference took place a few days agohere at United Nations headquarters. On that occasion  anumber of measures were examined concerning theimplementation of the recommendations formulated in thedocument adopted last year in Bucharest. In this respect  weintend to present a draft resolution to the General Assemblywith a view to ensuring the follow-up to this process untilthe next Conference.Romania highly appreciates the framework providedby the United Nations system  since it allows for the broadparticipation of all countries in all fields and enables thesearch for common interests that transcend national pride.Please allow me to raise a few issues relating toRomania  a country engaged in the broad and difficultprocess of economic reform. For us  maintaining aninternational environment that is stable  predictable andstimulating to business and investment is central tofulfilling our economic reform programme.Romania?s fundamental option — that of Europeanreintegration and membership in NATO — is well known.Our political objectives remain unchanged. Even if the rateat which these objectives are achieved varies from onecountry to another  we have no alternative. As we strive toreplace one system by another  we are encountering allthe difficulties of transition: low standards of living  theconfusion of values  a radical change of mentalitiesagainst the backdrop of social and administrative inertia.Everything has become a priority. Everything iscompulsory. Everything is urgent. This is why I feel weneed the support and encouragement of the internationalcommunity  to the benefit of democratization anddevelopment.With regard to subregional cooperation  ourexperience shows that crisis situations are generally seensolely from the political  military and sometimeshumanitarian perspectives  but rarely or never from thoseof economics or civil society. Certainly  there are well-targeted subregional projects  such as the Black SeaEconomic Cooperation and those relating to transportroutes linking the Caspian Sea to Western Europe  theancient silk route. But we have to recognize that South-Eastern Europe lacks broad economic integrating projectsthat are assisted by the main international institutions.In the absence of such economic cooperationprojects  our policy is somewhat reactive. We also haveto recognize that  in crisis situations  we still focus oneffects and not on causes; we try to limit the damage andprevent the spread of the crisis  but do not focus on theprevention of conflict itself.In our opinion  we should take better advantage ofthe framework provided by the United Nations system inorder to work out development-oriented politicalstrategies  in particular in the economic field. Similardevelopments — leading  on the one hand  to solidarityand  on the other  to an ever greater diversity of theproblems that confront us — can also be noted in otherregions of the world  not only in the Euro-Atlantic space.We have followed them attentively and appreciate theresults obtained within the North American Free TradeAgreement  the Southern Cone Common Market  theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations and otherorganizations.Among the priorities established by Romania  it isworth mentioning the objective of developing anddiversifying our political and economic relations withcountries of other regions  taking into account thecomplex and dynamic developments of an ever moreinterdependent world under the impact of globalization.In conclusion  allow me to assure the Assembly ofthe commitment of the Romanian delegation to16contributing effectively to United Nations activities invarious fields towards the successful outcome of the currentsession. We believe in the capacity of the United Nationsto tackle the complex problems facing the internationalcommunity on the eve of the third millennium."
"141",5962,"RUS",53,1998,"Mankind is increasingly feeling the windsof the twenty-first century. What they bring depends onall of us  on whether or not we succeed in respondingcollectively to new challenges and in establishing areliable system of international security and stability oncewe have overcome the vices  antagonisms and stereotypesaccumulated during the century about to end.This is not only possible  it is the imperative of ourtimes!A well-known Russian proverb says  â€œIf you wouldlive in the world  live in peaceâ€. It contains a highlyphilosophical message of everlasting value. Mankind willlive in peace and harmony once it has learned to resolveemerging problems through peaceful  political means.States will live in peace and harmony once they haverecognized their interrelationship and interdependence andstarted to seek collective responses to the challenges oftheir times.Experience confirms the truth of this popularwisdom. The most recent example is the sharpaggravation of the world monetary and financial crisiswhich has besieged many countries  including Russia which is undergoing sweeping economic reforms. Thecurrent upheaval in the world financial markets can beovercome only by joint efforts that do not pursueunilateral advantages and are intended to ensure globaleconomic stability. Interaction of States in this process including within the framework of the United Nations must  on principle  be raised to a new level.As for Russia  after overcoming an acute politicalcrisis  the countryâs President  Boris N. Yeltsin  theGovernment and the leading political forces are makingvigorous efforts to stabilize the economic and financialsituation. This is not an easy task  but the solution will befound.From this rostrum I pledge that Russia will notdeviate from the path of reform and will do its best topass with dignity this most difficult test  so as not only topreserve the democratic progress that has been made butalso to augment it.Likewise  Russiaâs foreign policy will remainconsistent and constructive. It is firmly geared towardsbuilding a democratic multipolar world  ensuringinteraction with other States in the interests of settlinginternational problems by political means and developingbroad  mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas.20We are convinced that the problems before the world no matter how complex they may be  can be solved on thebasis of strict observance of international law and closeinteraction among States. Multilateral organizations andmechanisms have a special role to play in this respect.Above all  this applies to the United Nations  whichcontinues to be the sole universal internationalpeacekeeping organization and is thus better equipped thanany other world body to reach agreements on how to settleconflicts  as well as to identify and remove the underlyingsocial and economic causes. It is important for UnitedNations efforts to be reinforced by support from regionalorganizations.We highly value the level of interaction that nowexists between the United Nations and the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  acting as areliable partner in addressing complex European problems as well as interaction with the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) and other regional organizations  includingthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Theinternational community has developed a unique arsenal ofpolitical and diplomatic tools intended for the resolution ofevery international problem. It must be put to effective use.Coercive actions constitute exceptional methods of lastresort. Their use must be strictly regulated by the rules ofinternational law and above all by the United NationsCharter. In other words  we advocate invoking the force oflaw rather than the law of force in international affairs.The fact that the Iraqi crisis which erupted earlier thisyear was settled precisely by political means  through thejoint efforts of many States and the initiatives launched bythe United Nations Secretary-General  provided graphicevidence that the potential inherent in constructive andactive diplomacy is by far more efficient than relyingexclusively on military force.A new outbreak of tensions around Iraq has made usdeeply concerned  since it is fraught with seriousconsequences for regional and international stability. Nodoubt Iraq must fully travel its part of the road  resume fullcooperation with the United Nations Special Commissionand the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) andimplement relevant Security Council resolutions. On theother hand  the Security Council must adequately assess thesituation related to the elimination of Iraqâs weapons ofmass destruction and answer the question of whether or notthat country still poses a threat to regional and overallinternational security after seven years of work carried outthere by United Nations inspectors. Concerted action by theworld community is required today to finally unblock thiscrisis situation.Political logic must prevail over the logic of force inour search for ways to settle the explosive conflict inKosovo. The use of tools of coercion to resolve theKosovo conflict might lead to a major war withunpredictable consequences for the Balkan region andEurope at large. It is our firm belief that a politicalsolution is the only possible way of settling the problemof Kosovo  granting it broad autonomy and ensuring strictrespect for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republicof Yugoslavia.The bloodshed in Afghanistan continues in spite ofthe fact that  as experience has shown  only temporarygains can be obtained in that country through the use ofarms. Rather  it is only through a persistent search forpolitical solutions  with the United Nations playing acentral role  that genuine stabilization  real settlement formation of an efficient central Government recognizedby all Afghans and  finally  assurance of Afghanistanâsterritorial integrity and independence can realistically beaccomplished.Collective political efforts are required to give asecond wind to the Middle East peace process. In ourview  it is not so much the absence of fresh ideas orproposals but rather the upsetting of the balance that hasstymied progress on all the negotiating tracks. It shouldnot be ignored that even if the Middle East process haslong-term objectives  it also has its time limits. Russia hasconsistently advocated the establishment of anindependent Palestinian State through political means andnegotiations. It is only in this way that the inalienablerights of the Palestinians to self-determination and reliableassurance of Israelâs legitimate security interests can berealized.In a parallel move  talks must be resumed on theSyrian and Lebanese tracks  building on the resultsalready achieved.The recently proposed settlement of the Lockerbiecase has been a major accomplishment of the internationalcommunity. The adoption by the Security Council of arelevant resolution was possible due to the constructiveapproach taken by the parties concerned â€” the UnitedStates  Great Britain  France and Libya â€” as well as dueto diplomatic efforts by many international organizations which were supported by Russia. It is essential to proceedwithout delay to its implementation.21Arguably  similar perseverance must be shown in theefforts to break the deadlock in the Cyprus settlement. TheUnited Nations must play a leading role to this end.Failure of the international community to fullyextinguish any one of the long-standing local conflicts inAfrica in recent years is a source of growing concern.Moreover  new flash points of tension have emerged on thatcontinent. It must be admitted that so far attempts toachieve full coordination between the United Nations andAfricaâs regional organizations have not succeeded. That iswhy the upcoming Security Council ministerial meeting onAfrica should focus on shaping a strong common stancecapable of radically reversing the negative dynamics ofAfricaâs latest developments.For objective reasons  Russia has paid special attentionto settlement of conflict situations in the CIS. Whether inAbkhazia  South Ossetia  Nagorno-Karabakh  Tajikistan orTrans-Dniestria  our country has but one objective â€”namely  promoting a political settlement and helping buildlasting peace. As requested by the sides concerned  Russiahas undertaken a difficult peace-building mission and isdoing all it can to bring it to fruition. But the effort canprove unavailing unless the parties in conflict showgoodwill and a constructive attitude and also receive moremeaningful international backing  above all from the UnitedNations and the OSCE.While making strong efforts to settle regional crises we should not lose sight of global problems  some of whichhave acquired a new dimension in the last year.We cannot but feel concerned over the emergence ofa real threat in the form of the proliferation of nuclearweapons throughout the planet. It is a common task of theinternational community to encourage all countries toaccede both to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We welcome Brazilâs accession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.Russia is committed to the idea of continued reductionof nuclear weapon arsenals and the maintenance of strategicstability at lower armament levels. In this context  weattach particularly great importance to the Russian-American interaction in the area of reducing strategicoffensive arms. In the course of his appointment hearings Mr. Yevgeny M. Primakov  Chairman of the RussianGovernment  expressed his firm resolve a few days ago toseek early ratification by the State Duma of the START IITreaty. Likewise  it is important for the United States toratify all documents related to START II.Accession of the other nuclear Powers to the nucleararms control process is now on the agenda. We urgecareful consideration of a proposal made by PresidentBoris Yeltsin that calls on the nuclear Powers to deploynuclear weapons exclusively within the boundaries oftheir national territories. We note with satisfaction therecent consensus decision in the Conference onDisarmament to start negotiations banning production ofnuclear-weapon-grade fissionable materials. What is ofspecial significance is that the decision was supported byStates that are not yet parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  among others. We areconvinced that such a ban would be a further necessarystep in multilateral efforts to enhance the non-proliferationregime and nuclear disarmament.The nuclear threat has many faces. Today  nuclearterrorism can also be a source of that threat. What seemedto be science fiction yesterday can now  much to ourregret  become a reality. Hence  strong action by theinternational community is required to prevent the real-life emergence of that new form of terrorism.Accelerating work on a draft convention to combat actsof nuclear terrorism  submitted by our country so that itcan be adopted by the General Assembly at the currentsession  has become particularly relevant.Russia has repeatedly stated at the highest level itsfirm opposition to terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations. International terrorism is one of the mostdangerous global challenges to international stability. Itcan be successfully combated only through united actionby all States. Indeed  only by acting together instead ofmaking unilateral power moves  shall we be able tosucceed in our fight against that most dangerous of evils.Militant separatism has become another factor thatdestabilizes international relations. Relying exclusively onextremist methods in the struggle for the national rightsof minority groups within multinational States  separatismoften finds itself in league with terrorism and religiousfanaticism. Separatism inevitably provokes internalconflicts in which neighbouring countries frequently getinvolved  thereby setting the stage for stoking regionalcrises.More than two and a half thousand nationalminorities live in 150 countries of the world. Were all ofthem to aspire to a State entity of their own  thedisastrous and catastrophic consequences could easily beimagined. Those who foment separatism should keep thatin mind.22The fight against drugs also requires joint  concertedaction. We must focus on the practical implementation ofthe relevant decisions aimed at combating the drug threatadopted by the General Assembly at its special session.The international community should take a commonstand in implementing the provisions of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  whose fiftieth anniversaryoccurs this year. In this area  too  resolute joint action isneeded in respect of those States which  under variouspretexts  violate generally recognized human rights andfreedoms. There can be no tolerance of double standardsinvolving attempts to shield those who elevate to the levelof Government policy discrimination against a part of thepopulation. Russia cannot and will not remain indifferent tothe fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian-speakingcitizens subjected to harsh repressive measures in Latviaand Estonia. The international community  and above all theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe should closely watch the situation in those countries.I have touched upon a few of the important issueswhich the United Nations is called upon to deal with at thistime. It continues to play its unique role as facilitator ofjoint efforts by States to strengthen peace and security  dealwith urgent issues and meet new global challenges. To thatend  it is necessary to improve United Nations mechanismsand adapt them to todayâs needs. That is exactly what theprocess of reforming the United Nations  launched bySecretary-General Kofi Annan  seeks to accomplish. Therationale behind it is enhanced efficiency for theOrganization.That is the angle from which we approach the ongoingdiscussion on the work of the Security Council. No oneshould question the Security Councilâs primaryresponsibility under the Charter for the maintenance ofpeace and security. It is extremely important to preserve itseffectiveness and its efficiency in decision-making  as wellas to build on internal cohesion and work coordinationmethods developed in recent years.I should like to reaffirm that we support theimplementation of reforms and changes in United Nationsmechanisms that will promote effective consolidation of theUnited Nations and improve its activities. Among the stepstaken to that end I wish to mention adoption  under UnitedNations auspices  of the Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court. Russiaâs initiative to launch a discussion onways to achieve international information security servesthe same goal. In essence  our proposal is intended to offsetthreats inherent in the use of the latest advances in scienceand technology for purposes incompatible with themaintenance of international security.I wish to single out a dangerous tendency: that ofadapting the United Nations to meet the requirements ofan individual State  or of replacing it altogether as  forexample  in the case of peacekeeping. What I have inmind are attempts to undercut the powers of the SecurityCouncil  as laid down in the Charter  to use coercivemeasures. We must not allow a precedent to be createdinvolving the use of military potential in a crisis situationwithout the consent of the Security Council. Surely it isobvious that such actions could lead to a serious erosionof the existing system of international relations  whosecentral element is the United Nations.United Nations sanctions as an instrument ofinternational coercion also require a highly balancedapproach. When introduced by the Security Council sanctions should not become a tool to fight a regime thatmay be disliked. Sanctions should not make people suffer.They should not destabilize the economic situation in thecountry subjected to sanctions or in the adjacent region.It is time to fine-tune the mechanism regulating theimposition of sanctions and their duration and theprocedures for easing and lifting them.In short  individual elements of the United Nationsmechanism need improvement and retooling. But weshould go about it with a full sense of responsibility mindful of the medical professionâs rule that unnecessaryharm is to be avoided at all costs.Every session of the General Assembly is  in a way a milestone event. Each session is expected to make atangible contribution to the resolution of acute problemsconfronting mankind. It will depend on all of us whetheror not the fifty-third session of the General Assemblylives up to the expectations and hopes we place in it. Itwill depend on all of us whether or not joint effectivesteps are taken to lead us to a more stable  peacefulworld  a world free from war and conflict and fromfinancial and economic upheaval  a world built on theprinciples of democracy and multi-polarity. Russia standsready to work with others to attain these goals."
"142",6009,"RWA",53,1998,"On behalf of the people of Rwanda and on my own behalf allow me to convey sincere and heartfelt congratulations toyou on your outstanding election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. This electionreflects the unanimous recognition by States of ourOrganization of your country  Uruguay. A well-deservedtribute is likewise extended to your distinguishedpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine  who demonstrateddedication  skill and open-mindedness at the last session.Heartfelt fraternal thanks go to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his skill  performance and far-sightedness. This fifty-third session of the GeneralAssembly is the second in his term of office. TheGovernment and the people of Rwanda are grateful to theSecretary-General for the working visit he made to Rwandain May 1998. That historic visit made it possible for him totake stock of the results of the genocide committed inRwanda in 1994  and we thank him for his words ofencouragement to the Government and the people ofRwanda for efforts made in the process of rebuilding thecountry.Each time we have had an opportunity to do so  theGovernment of Rwanda has supported the proposals of theSecretary-General with regard to the essential reforms ofour Organization and deemed that the same proposals forreform were likewise valid for the reform of the SecurityCouncil. We are prepared to continue our contribution toand support for the collective efforts to bring about moredemocratization in the Security Council at the dawn of thethird millennium.The existence of the specialized agencies within theUnited Nations has made this institution an instrument ofdevelopment  particularly in the economic  social  politicaland cultural fields  and in many other areas. TheGovernment of Rwanda supports the existence of thespecialized agencies of the United Nations. The UnitedNations reform under way should take them into account inorder to better structure them to be more operational.Since the 1960s  the Democratic Republic of theCongo has constantly been a source of concern to theUnited Nations and the international community. OneUnited Nations Secretary-General even lost his life there inthe search for a solution to the problems of that country.Today  more than in the past  this country  Congo —which has since become the Democratic Republic of theCongo — is experiencing the darkest times in its history because genocide is being committed there on the ordersof the highest authorities of that country.Since 2 August 1998  Rwanda  like everyone  hasbeen witnessing a rebellion in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo against the Government and President Kabila.Since then  the Government of Rwanda has consistentlypointed out that that crisis is purely internal and that Mr.Kabila had definitely been facing a highly structuredrebellion. The commission of the Ministers for ForeignAffairs of the Southern African Development Community(SADC)  composed of the four member countriesZimbabwe  Tanzania  Namibia and Zambia  acknowledgedin its report to SADC  following its fact-finding mission that a rebellion exists against Mr. Kabila in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. President Kabilahimself implicitly recognized the existence of thisrebellion when he published a long list of Congoleseauthorities that he banished by withdrawing theirCongolese passports and issuing international arrestwarrants against them. These Congolese were banished byPresident Kabila because they are leading the Congoleserebellion against him. Mr. Kabila’s implicit recognition ofthis rebellion was also shown when he arrested andimprisoned six journalists from the Kinshasa news agency“La Voix du Peuple” because he suspected them ofsupporting the Congolese rebellion.The position of Rwanda is to join its mediationefforts with those of the international community to finda solution to the Congolese crisis through negotiationsbetween the Congolese rebels and the Government ofPresident Kabila. Unfortunately  these efforts of theGovernment of Rwanda have collided with the obstinacyof President Kabila  who believes that the solution to thisinter-Congolese conflict is to persecute and massacre theBanyamulenge  the Tutsi and the Rwandese living inCongo  as well as Congolese who refuse to support hisgrim designs.In this respect  Rwanda  like other observers nearand far  is concerned at the increase in human rightsviolations committed by the Government of PresidentKabila  which is inciting the people to genocide massacres and racial and ethnic hatred. The Governmentof Rwanda believes that the United Nations mustcondemn the genocide as well as human rights violationsbeing committed in the Democratic Republic of the4Congo and take the necessary steps against the Governmentof President Kabila.This genocide and these human rights violations arecharacterized by summary executions  incitement to hatredby President Kabila and members of his Government massive arrests  arbitrary detentions and forceddisappearances. With regard to summary executions andincitement to hatred taking place in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  the following facts are illustrative.The present genocide and the massacres in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo are similar to those that occurred inRwanda in 1994 when the Radio Télévision Libre de MilleCollines (RTLM) was inciting people to hunt down Tutsisand their Hutu accomplices  as they were called by theradio station at the time.During the Victoria Falls Summit  which took place on7 and 8 August 1998  President Kabila declared that thosewho committed genocide in Rwanda were right and wereworthy of support then and now. This is tangible evidenceof recruitment by President Kabila of Interahamwe militiasand former members of the armed forces of Rwanda whocommitted genocide in Rwanda and took refuge in CongoBrazzaville  a fact recently denounced by the HighCommissioner for Refugees.At that same Victoria Falls Summit  President Kabilaimplied that Rwanda was seeking to establish a Himaempire in the Great Lakes region. In that regard  myGovernment believes that that statement by President Kabilashows his racist leanings and theories  similar to thosespread during the 1980s by the late President Habyarimanaand his ilk  who invented this pseudo-empire to stifle theclaims of Rwandese refugees who had been in exile formore than 30 years and who were beginning to vociferouslyreclaim their inalienable rights to unconditional return totheir motherland.These  then  are the racist theories cunningly inventedand orchestrated by the former President of Rwanda Mr. Habyarimana  and his regime in order to demonize theTutsi. Now  unfortunately  Mr. Kabila is making use ofthem once more to demonize not only the Tutsi but thewhole of Rwanda and all its people. In that context  theGovernment of Rwanda requests the internationalcommunity to put an end to these groundless racist theoriesand this campaign to demonize Rwanda and its people.President Kabila and his close collaborators areinciting the Congolese people to acts of mindless violenceagainst any person suspected of being a rebel  any personof Tutsi origin and any person who  according to them  isin league  directly or indirectly  with the rebellion.The governmental authorities of Kinshasa are callingupon the people  through the official media  “to treat theenemy like a virus  a mosquito  a piece of garbage thatmust be crushed with determination and without mercy”.The Congolese Minister of Justice  who after all issupposed to be safeguarding everyone’s human rights  hassaid  “These Rwandans  these Tutsis  they are insects microbes that must be methodically eradicated.”In support of the words of President Kabila  whosaid he would export war to Rwanda  the CongoleseMinister of Health  Dr. Jean-Baptiste Nsonji  stated  “TheRwandans will become like snakes whose head and tailhave been cut off  unable to move  unable to escape.”In response to these incitements to hatred andviolence spread by President Kabila and the CongoleseMinister of Information  Mr. Didier Mumengi  theMinister of Health  Dr. Jean-Baptiste Nsonji  and theDirector of President Kabila’s cabinet  Mr. YerodiaAbdoulaye  the population has begun to attack personssuspected of being in league with the rebels. People havebeen burnt alive because they were caught with red mudon their shoes — red being the colour of the mud in theregion of the lower part of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  at that time occupied by rebels.The Government’s soldiers have fired point blank atother suspects whose bodies were abandoned in thestreets. Several mentally ill people were summarilyexecuted because of a rumour  spread by Kabila’sGovernment  that the rebels had disguised themselves asmadmen in order to pass unnoticed. On 27 August 1998 a mentally ill person living at the corner of Kasai andUsoke streets in the town of Barumbu was riddled withbullets in the central market of Kinshasa. An unidentifiedperson was summarily shot down because he was caughtspeaking on a cellular phone. Another person wasexecuted purely and simply because he was speakingEnglish.President Kabila’s governmental troops are using allpossible means to wipe out the evidence of the atrocitiesthey commit. Several witnesses  including somefishermen  agree that they saw human bodies carried onthe waters of the Congo river. Other persons suspected ofbeing rebels have been buried alive in Kitambo andMasina.5The mass arrests  arbitrary detentions and forceddisappearances in the Democratic Republic of the Congohave been denounced in particular by an African humanrights association (ASADHO) that works in Kinshasa. Theassociation denounced these arrests and disappearances on10 August and 3 September 1998  and the following factswere stated by this Congolese human rights association:“Several individuals of Tutsi origin were arrested andarbitrarily detained in the Kokola and Tshatshi campsand in various jails belonging to the informationservice and in the Kin-Mazière jail in Kinshasa-Gombe; more than 500 soldiers from the formerZairian armed forces were arrested  and some are stillmissing to this day.“Other Congolese who are married to Tutsis  friendsof Tutsis or who look like Tutsis have been arrestedin connection with this inter-Congolese conflict. Somepersons have been removed from their homes  theirhotel rooms and even from the premises of the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) inKinshasa  as a result of curfews and various manhuntoperations decreed by the Kabila Government.”All these facts are cited from that Congolese human rightsassociation.The Rwandan Government believes  once again  thatthe solution to this inter-Congolese conflict lies in politicalnegotiations between the Kabila Government and the rebels for the following reasons.First  the Congolese must resolve among themselves once and for all  the question of nationality and citizenship though this is not negotiable. Normally  a question ofnationality or citizenship is not up for negotiation  but webelieve that this problem has to be resolved among theCongolese. Indeed  we wonder why President Kabila’sformer ministers  such as the Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. Karaha  and the Minister of State to the Presidency ofthe Republic  Mr. Bugera  and many other Congolesecitizens from the eastern part of the country have beenbanished from their homes and from Congolese territory. Itis Rwanda’s view that we cannot eternally have statelesspeople on our borders  especially the eastern border of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.Secondly  this inter-Congolese conflict hasrepercussions for the security of the neighbouring countries particularly Rwanda  given that Kabila’s forces are acombination of all the criminal elements of the countries ofthe region. Security in the north of Rwanda is constantlymenaced by elements of the former Rwandan ArmedForces and the Interahamwe soldiers who committed thegenocide in Rwanda in 1994 and who still use Congoleseterritory as a rear base in order to reprise their gruesomecrimes. The security of neighbouring countries must be aconstant source of concern to the Government and thepeople of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. TheGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congomust be constantly mindful of the fact that each time theforces of evil seek to sow insecurity in a neighbouringcountry  the country of origin of these destabilizing forcesforfeits its sovereignty and territorial integrity.Thirdly  the Congolese army should be national  nota Katangese militia composed of followers of PresidentKabila; the Congolese of the eastern part of the country the Banyamulengue  the Congolese of Masisi  those ofJomba and those of Rutshuru and other eastern locales  aswell as other regions of the country  should also be partof it.Fourthly  the inter-Congolese conflict will beresolved by good governance and good leadership thatdoes not incite people to commit genocide and massacreof part of the population that it is supposed to protect.The political negotiations between the Kabila Governmentand the rebels must encourage the emergence of this kindof leadership  which the Democratic Republic of theCongo so urgently needs.Fifthly  the philosophy of genocide and the cultureof murder that President Kabila is cultivating in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  with the assistance offormer elements of the Rwandan Armed Forces and theInterahamwe soldiers that committed the genocide inRwanda  as well as terrorists in the pay of either country must be quickly eradicated from the Congolese populationby a new  enlightened leadership devoted to the nationalcause  the cause of all Congolese without exception.We have spoken at some length on the problems ofthe Great Lakes region  and particularly those of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo; this is necessary inview of my Government’s great esteem  respect andconsideration for the fraternal people of the Congo. Thatis why my Government shouldered its responsibility anddid its neighbourly duty to the Congolese people  interalia by demonstrating solidarity with the fraternal peopleof Congo in helping it rid itself of the 32-yeardictatorship of the former President Mobutu  who hadbankrupted the country.6In its efforts to find a solution to the present crisis inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  the Government ofRwanda supports political negotiations leading to theemergence of a leadership worthy to guide the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo to a future other than that ofgenocide — which  unfortunately  is the situation under theregime of President Kabila.But although President Kabila and his cronies havebrought disappointment and despair to the Congolese peopleby sowing ethnic hatred in their country  Rwanda — whichhad the misfortune to be the victim of the 1994genocide — has the right to denounce the crime againsthumanity that is now being perpetrated in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  in order to prevent it from beingexported to Rwanda  as appears to be on President Kabila’spolitical and military agenda.We hope that the United Nations will speedilycondemn the genocide being perpetrated in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and will take the necessary steps tohalt it before it is too late. Copies of the Dallaire fax on thegenocide in the Democratic Republic of the Congo arewithout question to be found here in New York  at theUnited Nations Office at Geneva  at the European Unionheadquarters in Brussels and in every Western capital. Inthe light of the existence of the Dallaire fax  no one canclaim not to have been informed in time to condemnPresident Kabila’s acts of genocide and those of theInterahamwe militia and the elements of the formerRwandan Armed Forces  who planned and carried out thegenocide in Rwanda more than four years ago.At the very beginning of the crisis  the CongoleseMinister of the Interior  Mr. Gaëtan Kakudji  quietlyapproached the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the HighCommissioner for Human Rights and told them that unlessthey quickly organized the evacuation of all those who hadbeen arrested  those people would be killed. We wonderwhat the United Nations did in response to that alarmsounded by a Congolese official  none other than theMinister of the Interior  who has now dissociated himselffrom President Kabila’s acts of genocide by abandoning hisministerial post and fleeing his country for Europe according to information in the media. The defection of theCongolese Minister of the Interior  who is a cousin ofPresident Kabila  may be food for thought  and perhaps forinspiration  for President Kabila’s new allies. Will theycontinue to support a genocidal regime that has come to beabhorred by its own people?The Governor of Shaba-Katanga province also madea discreet appeal to the United Nations and  thus  to theinternational community; he revealed that he had officialorders to massacre all Congolese Tutsis  anyone ofRwandese origin  and any Congolese who resisted thisgrim plan. How did the United Nations respond to thatappeal from the Governor of Shaba-Katanga province?Many people are wondering whether or not Rwandahas a presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.They have  indeed  made this an overriding issue. Theproblem of the situation in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo and of attempts to resolve it is not to find outwho is and who is not in the Congo; it is to try tounderstand why. Why is a given actor present in theCongo? What are the real reasons for such a presencethere  and why is another actor not present or even tryingto be there? Why is genocide being committed in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo on the orders of thehighest authorities  including President Kabila himself?What is the meaning of the presence in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo of the combined genocidal forcesthat came from Rwanda in 1994 — the Interahamwemilitia  elements of the former Rwandan Armed Forces elements of the ex-forces of the former Ugandan dictatorIdi Amin Dada  terrorists in the pay of one country oranother  and other trouble-makers? Around whom andagainst whom are these fascist forces uniting in theterritory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo?Will the United Nations and the entire internationalcommunity wait for genocide to be committed in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo before they dispatcha commission of enquiry after the event? Could not theInternational Criminal Court — whose recentestablishment through the adoption of a suitable statutewe welcome — quickly take up this matter and arrest theleader and his henchmen who are now engaged in murderin the Democratic Republic of the Congo?Those are the real questions that in our humble viewshould be asked about the present crisis in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo — a crisis to which a purelypolitical solution has to be found through politicalnegotiations between the Government of President Kabilaand the Congolese rebels."
"143",6052,"SAU",53,1998,"I am pleased to express my sincere congratulationsto Mr. Didier Opertti on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-third session. As much ashis election reflects the esteem in which he personally isheld  it is also reflects our appreciation of the positive roleplayed by his country  Uruguay  in the international arena.I am confident that his presidency will be an effectivefactor in achieving the objectives to which theinternational community today aspires.I would like to take this opportunity to convey toHis Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko  President ofthe Assembly at its fifty-second session  our appreciationand esteem for having conducted the Assembly?s workeffectively  wisely and objectively.I am also pleased to express my appreciation andesteem to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. KofiAnnan  who is managing the affairs of the internationalOrganization with high competence and experience  andwho is making continuous efforts and persistentendeavours to achieve peace and security in today?sworld  which continues to face many kinds of conflictsand various forms of crises and challenges.A hundred years ago this year  the late King AbdulAziz Bin Abdulrahman Al-Saud began the initial stagesof rebuilding and uniting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia onthe principles of tolerant Islamic beliefs. In that processof unification  the late King Abdul Aziz was also layingthe groundwork of a modern State which combines  onthe one hand  adherence to Islam as a belief  a system anda way of life and  on the other hand  advanced forms ofdevelopment and modernization. Since then  the Kingdomof Saudi Arabia  which adheres to the religion of Islam has played a significant international role  because itfollows a foreign policy which conforms to thefundamental principles of the United Nations and with thenoble objectives for which the Charter was formulated.These are in accordance with Islamic law in matterspertaining to the conduct of relations between States. Theeternal message of Islam unites and does not divide establishes justice and does not inflict injustice  promotesequality and does not discriminate. It urges everyone towork and cooperate to propagate these sublime principlesand to achieve security  peace and prosperity for allhumanity.Abiding by these principles  the Kingdom of SaudiArabia  since its establishment  has continued to believein constructive dialogue and peaceful coexistence amongnations and peoples. It endeavours to cooperate and torespect the principles of international law andinternational legitimacy  it rejects violence and terrorismin any shape or form  and it does not interfere in theaffairs of others or allow others to interfere in its ownaffairs.10On the basis of the same principle  the Government ofthe Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  King Fahd BinAbdul-Aziz Al-Saud  is intent on performing its role in theinternational arena in such a way as to assist in creating themost favourable conditions for realizing the aspirations ofthe international community to security  peace  stability andprosperity.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is proud that it was oneof the original signatories of the San Francisco Charter which founded the United Nations  and it is proud also thatit constantly adheres to the principles and purposes of thatCharter. It also consistently endeavours to put theseprinciples and purposes into practice. On the basis of thoseconsiderations  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms thatit earnestly supports the United Nations and its specializedagencies  for it views the Organization as a viableframework for cooperation among nations and peoples  animportant forum for dialogue and understanding  and aneffective means to settle disputes and defuse crises.My Government wishes to emphasize a basic fact: theability of the Organization to play all its roles and to carryout all those tasks depends on the political will to put thoseCharter principles and provisions into practical effect.In this regard  my Government is well aware of theimportance of modernizing the United Nations agencies toenable them to play their required role  and on a level thatenables them to deal with the new developments in moderninternational relations. The Security Council  which bearsprimary responsibility for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  remains the focus of the various reformproposals that have been put forward. In this regard  mycountry?s point of view has been based on a deepconviction that any restructuring of the Security Councilmust be aimed at improving the Council?s ability toperform its role effectively  in accordance with the Charter and at making more active in implementing its resolutionsand in dealing with international crises. The Council mustalso cooperate with the General Assembly in a manner thatachieves the required harmony and the desired objectivity.As we seek greater cooperation  we have to look tothe lessons of history to identify the obstacles which theUnited Nations has faced and which have hindered it fromenhancing the cooperation that has become a requirementfor peace  stability and growth. We have to hold thecountries which base their international relations onprinciples that contradict the Charter basically responsiblefor creating those obstacles  and to make use of the meanscontained in the Charter to oppose such practices. Insistenceon violating the principles of the Charter and refusal tocomply with the resolutions of the General Assembly andthe Security Council signal a blatant challenge to theCharter  which we must firmly confront in a manner thatis consistent with its provisions and purposes.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  in line with itsobjective of achieving peace  security and stability in theMiddle East  has supported the peace process from thevery beginning and participated as an observer in theMadrid Conference. It has also participated actively in themultilateral negotiations  and will continue to support thepeace process in its international activities and contacts.In addition  the Arab countries  in conformity withthe conclusions of the Arab Summit held in Cairo in June1996  have unanimously adopted a firm positionstipulating that peace is a strategic Arab option. Thisaffirms that there has been no Arab retreat from that firmposition.What is regrettable  and a cause of grave concern  isthat  after a glimmer of hope for peace in the region andafter the optimistic feelings that peace was possible  thepeace process — which started in Madrid on the basis ofthe principles of international legitimacy  United Nationsresolutions and the principle of land for peace — hassuffered repeated setbacks at the hands of the presentIsraeli Government. This Government has endeavoured topursue policies that are based on retreating from theprinciples of the peace process endorsed by the MadridConference  as well as from the agreements signed withthe Palestinian National Authority  and it continues torefuse to resume negotiations with Syria at the point thathad been reached previously.In striving to destroy the peace process  the IsraeliGovernment has continued to build settlements onPalestinian lands in order to alter their character andcreate new realities. It is also adopting a policy ofJudaizing Holy Jerusalem by planting more settlements inand around it  as well as annexing areas with Jewishsettlers and emptying Jerusalem of its Arab residents. Italso enacted a law to enlarge the municipality of HolyJerusalem to include neighbouring settlements so as topreempt the negotiations on the final status of Holy Jerusalem.These Israeli practices have resulted in aborting theefforts of the international community to achieve a justand comprehensive peace based on Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and on the land-for-peace principle. Such practices have led the peace11process down a dead-end road. What we perceive of thebehaviour of the present Israeli Government does not makeus optimistic about the possibility of achieving the peacewhich the peoples of the region aspire to unless thesepractices are met by firm measures to compel Israel tocompletely implement its agreements with the Palestinians respect the principles on which the peace process wasfounded and enter into serious negotiations with thePalestinian Authority  with Syria and with Lebanon. Weurge the international community  and the United States ofAmerica in particular  to continue making all possibleefforts to save the peace process and to act resolutely tostop Israeli tampering with the most sensitive issue in thepeace process — Jerusalem  which should be dealt with onthe basis of its being the most important case in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Adhering to the rules of internationallegitimacy and fulfilling commitments is the best way toachieve peace and security.If the present Israeli Government is serious in itsefforts to achieve peace with the Palestinian side  all it hasto do is to affirm its adherence to the provisions of thesigned agreements and resume the negotiations on theunresolved issues. If the Israeli Government intends toachieve a state of mutual security with its neighbour  Syria the Syrian Government has spared no effort in declaring itsreadiness to resume negotiations with Israel from the pointat which such negotiations had stopped. As for tension andthe cycle of violence in southern Lebanon  its end iscontingent upon immediate Israeli withdrawal from that partof Lebanon and the western Bekaa valley in accordancewith Security Council resolution 425 (1978).The position of the Government of the Custodian ofthe Two Holy Mosques towards Iraq has two fundamentalbases: first  guaranteeing the comprehensive  total indivisible and non-selective compliance by the IraqiGovernment with the resolutions of international legitimacy;and secondly  insuring the preservation of the independence sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of Iraq  as well asalleviating the sufferings of the Iraqi people.Our feelings of pain and sorrow for the sufferings ofthe brotherly Iraqi people  because of the hard conditionswhich they endure  contribute to our insistence on Iraqicompliance with all relevant international resolutions inorder to get the sanctions lifted. In this context  it is withdeep sadness that we received the news of the IraqiGovernment?s decision not to cooperate with the UnitedNations Special Commission established by the SecurityCouncil. This will result in the continuation of sanctions onIraq. We call upon the Iraqi Government to annul thatdecision  and we stress that the quickest means for liftingthe sanctions is faithful and meticulous responsiveness  inletter and spirit  to the requirements of the SecurityCouncil resolutions. The Iraqi Government should stopthe policies of prevarication and delay aiming at impedingthe implementation of these resolutions  especially thoseconcerning the release of prisoners and detainees  thereturn of property  commitment to a modality forcompensation and full cooperation with the efforts of theUnited Nations Special Commission to eliminate weaponsof mass destruction.Saudi Arabia and its sisters  the members of the GulfCooperation Council  place great importance on thebettering of relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran.We have been particularly pleased at the recent positiveindicators from the Iranian Government which could havea positive impact on Iranian-Gulf relations and on theclimate of peace and stability in the region. In thisconnection  we welcome the positive implications —regarding both Gulf-Iranian relations and the issue ofarmaments in the statement by President MohammadKhatami before the General Assembly last week. We lookforward to resolving the outstanding problems betweenthe two sides — foremost among which is the issue of thethree United Arab Emirates islands  Greater Tunb  LesserTunb and Abu Musa — by peaceful means  in accordancewith the principles of international law  including theoption of referring the matter to the International Court ofJustice.We also express our concern regarding the currenttension between Iran and Afghanistan. We call upon thesetwo countries to exercise restraint and resolve theirdispute by peaceful means.The continuing fighting in Afghanistan during allthese years is a cause of sadness and sorrow. SaudiArabia has done all it could since the beginning of thefighting to stop the bloodshed and to restore peace andsecurity to Afghanistan. We support the efforts of theUnited Nations and the Organization of the IslamicConference to stop the fighting. At the same time  westrongly deplore the manipulation of the present situationof Afghanistan to make it a haven for the sheltering andtraining of terrorists  which destabilizes security andbrings further suffering to the Afghani people.Shortly after the Serbs terminated their aggressionagainst the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  theyignited the flames of a new war  aiming this time at ourbrothers in Kosovo. The Serb forces are daily committing12in Kosovo the same inhuman practices which theyperpetrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina  including ethniccleansing  coerced deportation  terror and oppression in fullview of the whole world. It would be truly tragic if silencein the face of these appalling actions was to continue overthis long duration. Therefore we call upon the internationalcommunity to shoulder its responsibilities by promptlytaking all requisite measures to put an end to thesepractices.Terrorism  which is striking every corner of the worldmercilessly and indiscriminately  has become a very seriousinternational phenomenon and requires an internationaleffort to combat it. The Government of Saudi Arabia hasregularly condemned terrorism and has joined its efforts toother international efforts to confront it with all possibleeffectiveness. We stress in particular that terrorism andviolence are universal phenomena rather than thecharacteristics of a certain people  race or religion.Precisely because of the comprehensiveness anduniversality of terrorism  the only way to combat it isthrough unified international action within the frameworkof the United Nations  with a view to ensuring an end toterrorism  saving the lives of the innocent and preservingthe independence and sovereignty of States. But combatingterrorism would also require international cooperationagainst sheltering terrorist elements and groups andpreventing them from exploiting the territories and laws ofthe States in whose territories they live in order to practicetheir destructive activities  regardless of any pretexts.The conflict in Jammu and Kashmir remains a threatto peace and security in South Asia. We call for finding apeaceful solution to this problem in accordance with therelevant United Nations resolutions and for allowing thepeople of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise directly theirlegitimate right to self-determination.The Government of the Custodian of the Two HolyMosques pays maximum attention to the ongoing efforts toeliminate weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East including the Arabian Gulf region. This is undertakenthrough its support of the efforts of the League of ArabStates in accordance with the resolution adopted by theLeague?s Council during its 101st session which called formaking this sensitive part of the world a zone free of allweapons of mass destruction: nuclear  chemical andbiological.We are greatly concerned by Israel?s refusal to accedeto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT). Israel thus keeps its nuclear programmes outside theambit of international inspection  which constitutes aserious threat to the region?s security and stability. Whilewe completely reject the international community?sdouble standard that allows Israel an exception fromnuclear disarmament efforts and thus encourages the armsrace  we also express our concern at the nuclear testscarried out in South Asia  begun by India and followed byPakistan  in view of the dangers these tests present to thesecurity and peace of the region.While believing there is urgent need to increase theeffectiveness of the NPT through the activation anduniversalization of the system of guarantees of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  we alsoconsider it of the utmost importance to establish controlsand criteria that would assist in achieving the desiredprogress in all fields of disarming weapons of massdestruction  in conformity with General Assemblyresolution 1 (I) of 1946. In this context  we urge all Statesthat have not yet done so to take the necessary steps asearly as possible to accede to the NPT and place theirnuclear installations under the international safeguardsregime  thereby contributing to international peace andsecurity.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considersenvironmental issues and environmental protection of keyimportance  to the degree that it has assigned to them aprominent place in our domestic and foreign policies. Webelieve that a decent life for mankind is directlyconnected with environmental and climatic conditions.Therefore  the Kingdom has effectively participated in allrelevant conferences  forums and internationalorganizations concerned with environmental protection. Inaddition  we have become a party to several regional andinternational agreements relevant to this issue.We only hope that international efforts relating tothe problems of the environment will be characterized bythe necessary degree of balance and of objectivity  asbased on serious and rational studies and buttressed byscientific facts that take into account the needs ofdevelopment in the developing world. In this regard  wecall upon all States to abide by Agenda 21. We also urgethe industrial States in particular to live up to theirobligations regarding the transfer of environmentaltechnology to developing countries.The emerging forces of globalization and theirseemingly rampant nature which cause geographic political and sovereignty barriers to recede  force upon usthe need to tame and channel these energies. Therefore 13we are now called upon more than at any other time beforenot to confront this phenomenon  but to act cohesively inits formulation  in conformity with our religious beliefs  ourcultural and civilizational values  and in the interests of ourpeoples. This should also be accomplished in a manner thatwould accord with the diversity and pluralism of social andpolitical systems that have prevailed after the bipolarism ofthe cold war. The objective would be to build a balancedworld based on mutual interest  reciprocity of advantagesand equality of opportunity to live free from fear  securefrom hunger and poverty. It would be a world in whichprinciples of justice  prosperity and peace predominate.It is important to stress  in this regard  that theprinciples of free world economies and open markets arenot an end in themselves. They are but a means to growingthe economies through the increase and expansion ofexports. The developing countries cannot attain theseobjectives without greater flexibility in the varyingopportunities afforded to them in the form of humanresources  infrastructure  and financial  administrative andprocedural regulations. Consequently  the developingcountries are required more than ever before to intensifytheir internal development efforts in order to be integratedin the international economy. This calls for closercooperation in international fora in order to deal with theissues of development and to draft a considered andcomprehensive agenda that fulfils the ambitions andaspirations of the peoples of developing countries within theframework of the new economic order.In this context  we cannot ignore the important rolethat needs to be played by the developed countries  whomust fulfil their international commitments to thedeveloping and less developed countries either by direct orindirect aid as well as through cancellation and reschedulingof foreign debt. Developed countries must also allow freeand easy access to their markets for the exports ofdeveloping countries and must refrain from adopting unjusttrade measures that impede the flow of such exports to theirmarkets.In this regard  it must be noted that the Kingdom ofSaudi Arabia has been very keen on contributing  within thelimits of its means  to the development of developingcountries  whether at the bilateral or multilateral levels.Because of its desire to participate in the efforts to achievea better future for the international economy  Saudi Arabiahas applied for membership in the World TradeOrganization. God willing  and with the support of friendlycountries  we hope to finalize the accession procedures assoon as possible.The issues just mentioned  with their political economic  security and social dimensions  confirm theneed for our Organization to assume its role in themaintenance of international peace and security and torealize the aspirations of all peoples to live in securityand enjoy stability and prosperity. Our firm belief in therole that the United Nations can play in dealing withcrises  as well as our efforts to avoid the horrors of warand to prepare for international cooperation  make usmore determined than ever to support this Organizationand emphasize its constructive role. The United Nationsmust have a larger role in dealing with crises before theyoccur by exercising preventive diplomacy in order tomaintain stability and preserve international peace andsecurity. We have great hopes that the Organization willcontinue its march towards these goals with strong stepsand firm determination.I cannot find more suitable words to end mystatement than this verse from the Holy Quran:“Work  soon Allah will observe your work  and HisMessenger  and the Believers.” (The Holy Quran IX:105)"
"144",6091,"SDN",53,1998,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Opertti on hiselection to the presidency of the General Assembly at thissession. We are confident that his vast experience andcapabilities will lead this session to success. I would liketo assure him of the full cooperation of my delegation.Allow me also to express our gratitude to his predecessor the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine  for hiscommendable efforts and to express similarcongratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan and his able assistants for their efforts to ensure animproved performance by the Organization  to bolster itsstatus and to achieve its lofty objectives.There are many questions in my country  in ourArab and African region  and in the rest of the world.There is a war raging between our neighbours on theeastern and southern borders. All of these questions needto be debated.The considerable improvement in the economicsituation in the Sudan is reflected in the latestInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) reports  whichindicate an increase in the growth rate and a reduction inthe inflation rate. We expect the Sudan to become an oil-30exporting State in the next few months. This is an issuewhich we are very happy to brief you on.There is also the constitutional evolution and politicalopenness in the Sudan  culminating in the approval by theSudanese people in a referendum of a new constitutionearlier this year. This will enhance the institutions of civilgovernance and the peaceful transfer of power based on asystem of political pluralism. These developments areimportant to political stability in Africa?s largest country the Sudan  a land of vast untapped resources.I also wish to talk about the humanitarian situation inthe Sudan and the improvements in that situation. Sudanappreciates the efforts of the international community andexpresses its full commitment to cooperate in thefacilitation of these efforts. This is a matter which deservesfurther elaboration.There are also the peace efforts in southern Sudan andthe positive response of the Sudanese Government to thecalls for a ceasefire by the international community including the Security Council  the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development (IGAD) and the EuropeanUnion. This ceasefire was rejected by the rebel movement resulting in the continuation of war and more suffering forthe citizens. This also is a matter which requires furtherelaboration.All these questions require more details  but I willleave that to other committees and forums  as I shallconcentrate today on one single issue: the Americanaggression committed against my country on 20 August1998. This American act  if not properly addressed  couldundermine all the achievements made by our peoplethrough years of struggle and suffering.It would be appropriate to recall the events whichbegan on 7 August. On that day the explosions took placein Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. That same evening theSudan condemned those heinous terrorist acts. Weconveyed our condolences to the Presidents and theMinisters for Foreign Affairs of the United States  Kenyaand the United Republic of Tanzania. I also made telephonecalls to my Kenyan and Tanzanian colleagues expressingSudan?s fullest readiness to cooperate to the maximumpossible extent in the efforts to search for  apprehend andpunish the culprits.The American Administration requested fly-overpermission for their military aircraft in order to evacuatethe wounded and the dead from Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam and their request was granted. That was followed byanother request for open fly-over permission for theirmilitary aircraft  to which we responded promptly and ingood faith  as it was  in our view  a humanitarian requestwhich deserved a response. Subsequently  contacts in thisregard between the Sudanese and American securityauthorities were begun. We welcomed these contacts andgave assurances of our full cooperation.But  all of a sudden  within minutes and withoutwarning  the Sudanese people were shocked on theevening of Thursday  20 August  by a grave act ofterrorism  as heinous and cowardly as those of Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi. The “Al-Shifa” pharmaceutical plant which only a few hours before that event was producinglife-saving medicines for children  women and the elderlyin the Sudan and which was a model of the economicdevelopment of my country  was completely destroyed.Some of the innocent Sudanese citizens  employeesof the factory  lost their lives under the rubble  whileothers lost their sight  or some of their limbs  or were leftswimming in blood. Families of the victims and the restof the employees were suddenly bereft of the sources oftheir livelihood.A few minutes later  we watched the message of theAmerican President on television  where he stated that theUnited States armed forces had launched air strikesagainst the Sudan and Afghanistan. He said that they haddestroyed a plant in the Sudan linked to Osama BinLaden which produced chemical weapons.This is the American perspective  which I haveconveyed to you clearly. What then is the Sudaneseperspective?I would like to state clearly and confidently that thefactory produced medicine — and nothing but medicine.The plant belonged to the private sector. It was owned bya Sudanese businessman  and it had no link whatsoeverwith Osama Bin Laden. The factory was financed by thePTA Bank of the Common Market for Eastern andSouthern Africa (COMESA). It was one of the largest ofits kind in the Middle East and Africa.In his speech at the inaugural meeting of this sessionof the Assembly  President Clinton spoke about thetolerance and greatness of Islam. We appreciate what hesaid and would like to add that Islam calls for mutualrespect between civilizations  cultures and religions. Islamcalls for dialogue — indeed  all the revealed religions call31for dialogue — and all of these religions abhor andrenounce violence and injustice  because injustice begetshatred.All faiths call for justice. The principal rule of lawstipulates that the accused is innocent until proven guilty.However  here we are faced with a situation in which theSudan was accused by the United States  the Sudan wascondemned by the United States and the Sudan waspunished by the United States. Thus  the United States hasacted as the adversary  the jury and the judge — theopponent and the arbiter. The whole world rejected theAmerican aggression and its justification.Allow me to mention here some of those whosupported our position in the Sudan: the Arab League  theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  the Non-AlignedMovement (NAM)  the Organization of the IslamicConference (OIC)  the Group of 77 and China  and largesectors of the American community  including formerPresident Jimmy Carter  former Attorney-General RamseyClark  a number of Congressmen and the American massmedia. Our position was also supported by high-rankingofficials of Western countries  including presidents andforeign ministers  as well as by the British  Jordanian andAmerican engineers who took part in the construction andoperation of the factory and who continued their technicalassociation with it until it was destroyed. A number of legalexperts and lawyers from Western countries  as well asinternational trade unions and non-governmentalorganizations also voiced their support.In spite of this  the United States continues to opposethe dispatch of a fact-finding mission by the SecurityCouncil. The American officials claim that they analysed asample of the soil near the factory and found that itcontained chemical precursors used in the production ofVX — a nerve gas.If they are so sure of what they found  we wonderwhy they object to the dispatch of a fact-finding mission bythe Security Council so that the Council can be the judge.The factory has been destroyed  true; but the soil is stillthere and the remnants and the rubble of the factory arethere. The fact-finding mission can easily collect soilsamples and examine the machines  look into thedocuments and establish the facts about the output andownership of the factory. This is the sole demand of theSudan now.Last week the Group of Arab States presented a draftresolution to the Security Council. The draft does not seekto condemn the United States for its violation of thesovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State. Itonly requests the dispatch of a fact-finding mission toverify the allegations that were the basis of the decisionby the United States to launch a strike against a medicinefactory in the Sudan.It is the responsibility  indeed the obligation of theSecurity Council to do so. This is only a proceduralmeasure to ascertain the facts — a procedure which theCouncil has always followed in similar situations.Therefore the Sudan and the entire internationalcommunity call on the Security Council to send an urgentfact-finding mission to the Sudan so that the internationalcommunity can verify the allegations upon which theUnited States based its decision to strike the medicinefactory.The Sudan recognizes that sending a fact-findingmission is a legitimate request by a developing countrythat holds dear the principles of international legitimacyand believes strongly that the fight against terrorism which we condemn in all its forms  whether committedby individuals  groups or States  must be based on theprinciples and channels of international legitimacy andcooperation and the renunciation of force as a means forhegemony and domination.We in the Sudan recognize that the United States isa super-Power  and we do not seek to involve ourselvesin a confrontation or altercation with that super-Power.On the contrary  we are keen on establishing correctrelations with the United States on the basis of mutualrespect  common interest and constructive criticism. Weare ready to engage in a dialogue with the United Statesand to cooperate with it on all issues of common concern.The people of the Sudan respect the Americanpeople and are eager to maintain good relations withthem. It is incumbent upon the two Governments to workon reflecting this desire and to strengthen these historicrelations.We have paid tribute to the countries that providedhumanitarian assistance to those affected by the war insouthern Sudan  including the United States. However  weare perplexed by the provocative statement recently madeby the spokesman of the American Administration whenhe announced the donation of $25 000 to the victims offloods in the Sudan. The statement claimed that despiteits differences with the Government of the Sudan  theAmerican Administration is concerned about the welfareof the Sudanese people.32The American Administration launched 17 cruisemissiles to destroy the pharmaceutical factory. Each ofthose missiles costs $1 million  for a total of $17 million todestroy our factory. Now the United States announces itscontribution of $25 000 to the Sudanese victims of thefloods  while the damage caused by the floods is estimatedto exceed $40 million. Had the American Administrationgenuinely been concerned with the welfare and well-beingof the Sudanese people  it would not have attacked anddestroyed one of our main economic entities  whichproduced over 50 per cent of the essential and life-savingmedicines which the Sudan requires.Therefore  on behalf of the Sudanese people  we sayto the American Administration  that we want our factoryback  the factory we built with our toil and sweat andwhich cost us millions of dollars. We need the medicine ofwhich our people were deprived as a result of thedestruction of the factory  particularly in this time of theflooding crisis which caused rampant diseases andepidemics  according to United Nations reports.Allow me now to briefly reflect on some of theconflicts that are taking place in our area  in view of theirdirect impact on peace and security in the region.I start with our eastern borders  where the conflictbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea will undoubtedly lead to adeterioration of the situation in the region. The Sudan which still hosts hundreds of thousands of refugees fromthe two neighbouring countries  is strongly affected by thisconflict. Hence  from this rostrum we urge the twoneighbouring countries to exercise self-restraint and toresort to peaceful means to settle their differences. We alsohope that the efforts of the OAU will succeed in reachinga peaceful settlement to this dispute.On the other hand  we are following with greatconcern the developments in our southern neighbour  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  which is suffering fromexternal interference in its internal affairs. We hope that theefforts of the African countries will be successful inassisting the Government of the Democratic Republic of theCongo in maintaining peace and stability on its territory.As regards the peace process in the Middle East hopes for a final settlement have evaporated as a result ofthe Israeli intransigence  which placed hurdles on the roadto peace.The Sudan welcomes the General Assembly resolutionupgrading the Palestinian participation and supports thesteps taken by the Palestinian leadership to declare the stateof Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital. The Sudan alsodenounces the Israeli attempts to Judaize Jerusalem andchange its demographic composition and legal status.Furthermore  the Sudan supports the rights of Syriaand Lebanon to regain their occupied territories in theGolan and in southern Lebanon  and it calls upon theinternational community and the Security Council to exertpressure on Israel to implement the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions and to heed the call for a just peacein order for the region to enjoy peace and security.The embargo imposed on Iraq has lasted for toolong  and the suffering of the Iraqi people has deepened.Thousands of women  children and elderly people havelost their lives because of the lack of food and medicine and the world is wondering when the blockade will cometo an end. The latest impasse between the United NationsSpecial Commission and Iraq could result in catastrophicconsequences in the area. This should prompt the SecurityCouncil to intervene by carrying out a comprehensivereview of Iraqi compliance with Security Councilresolutions with a view to lifting the embargo. The Sudancommends the efforts of the Secretary-General andexpresses the hope that these efforts will lead to abreakthrough in the current impasse.The Sudan also wishes to stress the importance ofresolving the issue of the detainees and the missingKuwaitis as a humanitarian question  and it calls forredoubling regional and international efforts to settle thisproblem so that the women and children who have waitedso long can be reunited with their husbands and parents.This would also eliminate the causes of tension andrestore solidarity and reconciliation between Arab nationsand States.As regards the issue of Lockerbie  we are very muchconcerned with the embargo imposed on the sisterlyLibyan Arab Jamahiriya  our neighbour. The damagingconsequences of this embargo have spilled over fromLibya to the neighbouring countries  including the Sudan which has hundreds of thousands of citizens living in theJamahiriya. It is a cause for sadness that scores of thosecitizens have lost their lives while trying to cross the vastdesert between the two countries as a result of the airblockade imposed on the Jamahiriya. While welcomingthe recent positive developments in this issue  we stressthe need to provide the guarantees requested by theJamahiriya  as referred to by the President of BurkinaFaso  the current Chairman of the OAU  in his statementbefore the Security Council last week.33Conflicts in Africa have caused numerous difficulties including the problems of refugees and displaced persons.As a result  Africa has become host to the largest numberof refugees in the world. Their number is estimated at morethan 8 million  and they live in the harshest conditions.In its efforts to put an end to the suffering ofrefugees and to find durable solutions to this problem  theOAU decided to convene the first ministerial meeting ofthe Committee on Refugees and Disappeared Persons inKhartoum in December 1998 at the level of foreignminister. We in the Sudan look forward to theinternational community?s effective participation in andsupport for this conference in order to ensure its success.The countries of the continent are hopeful that theconference will produce results which would assist indealing with this long-standing problem.I should like to conclude with a verse from the HolyKoran:“God commands justice  the doing of good  andliberality to kith and kin. He forbids all shamefuldeeds  and injustice and rebellion. He instructs youthat ye may receive admonition.” (The Holy Koran XVI:90)"
"145",6136,"SEN",53,1998,"Senegal takes pleasure in addressing  through me  itsheartfelt congratulations to the President on his illustriouselection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session. His election is eloquent testimony to hisintellectual and moral qualities and to his vast experiencein international relations  and also reflects the unanimousrecognition by the Member States of our Organization ofyour country  Uruguay  for its ongoing commitment in theservice of international peace and cooperation.We express profound gratitude to his predecessor  Mr.Hennadiy Udovenko  former Minister for Foreign Affairs ofUkraine  for the skill and commitment with which hedischarged his duty throughout a particularly difficult year.Finally  I should like to pay a well-deserved tributeto the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  a man ofconviction who deserves our unreserved support in thepursuit and achievement of the outstanding work ofreform  to which he is fully committed in order to readyour Organization to meet the realities of the twenty-firstcentury.The annual sessions of the General Assemblyprovide special opportunities for the great United Nationsfamily to come together to consider collectively andthoughtfully the situation of the world and the problemsand challenges that our Organization must meet as itseeks to bring about peace  progress and solidarity forhuman society.As this century fades  we are living in an era markedby major challenges that involve all of us individually andcollectively. Our world is in the throes of transformation internationally as well as within each of our States  andour transition towards the third millennium is not withoutcertain contradictions.Globalization has become a worldwide phenomenon.The movement of people and ideas  the computer andinformation revolutions  the protection of the environmentand the fight against drugs and terrorism have alsobecome transnational phenomena that call for globalreform and thoroughgoing international solidarity  whichis the only thing that will allow us to attain our majorobjectives — for while we are all similar  we are also alldifferent.At the same time  fragmentations are increasing anddifferences are asserting themselves at the national level thereby leading to civil wars and ethnic and tribal conflictsthat often jeopardize the structure of our States. Formidablewealth has been created for a tiny minority  while vastexpanses of absolute poverty remain; and while humanrights are exalted here  they are mocked or trampledunderfoot elsewhere.The United Nations  which is the repository of theuniversal conscience  must adapt to these changing realitiesand develop the capacity to act  often with urgency  in theservice of peace and to respond appropriately to thelegitimate aspirations of humankind. As we seek to attainthe goals that are before us  our Member States have theresponsibility and the duty to endow our Organization withthe tools that will allow it effectively and rapidly toimplement the agenda for the twenty-first century.In this context  I should like to emphasize andwelcome two major developments that have marked therecent history of the United Nations. I shall refer first to theestablishment of the International Criminal Court  notbecause it takes priority but because the head of State ofmy country  President Abdou Diouf  has conferred upon methe honour of being involved in this issue for the past twoyears. Senegal was among the first signatories of the Statuteof the Court and is waiting only for the certified copybefore ratifying it. The Diplomatic Conference in Romewas without doubt a historic gathering  as for the first timethe nations of the world  in particular those from Africa united by a single and shared desire for justice  togetherfound a legal means of deterring those who might betempted to commit crimes against humanity  war crimesand crimes of genocide; a means of bringing them to trial if there are grounds for doing so; and a means ofsentencing them if they are found guilty. In short  we havesucceeded in forging the missing link in the internationallegal system.That gathering will also be remembered as historicbecause the Statute of the Court  which we solemnlyadopted on 18 July 1998  in such a symbolically rich placeas Rome  introduced major innovations in relations betweenStates and between national and international jurisdictions.Finally  if anyone needs to be reminded  I am happyto say that the Statute and the final act governing the Courtcomplement  and thereby imbue with greater meaning  theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  whose fiftiethanniversary we are commemorating this year as one of thegreat milestone events in the history of the United Nations.What is more  the Statute makes the ideal of justice moreprecise and more alive.I am pleased to say that my country  Senegal recently became the first State member of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to ratify theProtocol on the Establishment of the African Court onHuman and Peoples? Rights  which was adopted at themost recent OAU summit in Ouagadougou.Last year  during the fifty-second regular session ofthe General Assembly  we all warmly welcomed thereform proposals of the Secretary-General  contained inhis report (A/51/950) entitled “Renewing the UnitedNations: a programme for reform”. We were unanimousin believing that those judicious  balanced  innovative andaction-oriented proposals were very timely because theywere in tune with the spirit and letter of the Declarationissued on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary  whichstated:“In order to be able to respond effectively to thechallenges of the future and the expectations of theUnited Nations held by peoples around the world  itis essential that the United Nations itself bereformed and modernized.” (resolution 50/6 para. 14)This conviction  which we all shared  has todaybecome an imperative. Indeed  through the dynamicimpetus provided by the President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-second session  Mr. Udovenko  theGeneral Assembly adopted resolutions through which itendorsed and reaffirmed the implementation of themeasures and proposals recommended by the Secretary-General. In this regard  I should like to convey mysincere congratulations to Ms. Louise Fréchette  who hasbeen appointed to the distinguished position of DeputySecretary-General of our Organization  with particularresponsibility for development issues. To her  our partnerin development  I wish every success in carrying out herhonourable and important mission.In calling to mind the reforms that will enable theUnited Nations to become the cornerstone of amultilateral system better attuned to the realities of thetwenty-first century  I could not ignore the delicate andcomplex negotiations under way within the WorkingGroup entrusted with the question of restructuring theSecurity Council. Security Council reform is afundamental element in the overall reform of the United2Nations  but we must recognize that it will not be an easytask.We all agree on the need to modernize anddemocratize that essential United Nations body  but we arefinding it difficult to reach consensus  or even generalagreement  on such fundamental issues as the enlargement composition and right of veto. Despite five years ofdiscussions within the Working Group  we must notabandon our hopes and become discouraged. If we redoubleour efforts and benefit from the momentum that we havecreated  I am convinced that in due course we will succeedin this great undertaking to restructure the Security Councilby conferring on it greater legitimacy  credibility andtransparency.Africa certainly has its place in this reform — a placethat must be acknowledged given its history and its destinyas a continent of the future in which there is room forcontinued growth.The United Nations has traversed half a century  andduring the course of those years we have progressively laidthe groundwork for an international system that should beable to ensure our collective security. In this regard  ourOrganization has been and remains an irreplaceable tool forthe promotion and maintenance of international peace andsecurity. Despite the numerous achievements recorded inthat area  we must agree about how much farther we haveto travel  as well as about the bold initiatives to be taken inorder fully to secure international peace and security.Longstanding conflicts continue to resist our efforts atresolving them  while a number of fresh crises — a newgeneration of conflicts linked to an upswell in ethnic orintercommunity violence — continue to be a source ofmajor concern for our countries  especially those in Africa.Thus  in the subregion of western Africa  while SierraLeone was moving towards the total restoration ofconstitutional order with the return to Freetown of thedemocratically elected President owing to efforts by theUnited Nations  the Organization of African Unity andespecially the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  a mutiny broke out on 7 June last spearheaded by part of the standing army of the Republicof Guinea-Bissau.At the express request of the legal authorities of thatcountry  Senegal and the Republic of Guinea  anotherneighbour of Guinea-Bissau  dispatched troops inaccordance with the relevant provisions of the bilateralagreements signed by each of the two countries withGuinea-Bissau.I should like to reiterate that Senegal?s involvementin Guinea-Bissau is designed solely to help restoreconstitutional order  ward off threats to the safety of thecivilian populations and foreigners  and contribute to thestrengthening of stability and security in the subregionand throughout Africa.On 26 August 1998  ECOWAS  together with theCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries  succeededin inducing the parties to sign a ceasefire accord  the firststep towards the normalization of life in Guinea-Bissau.In the Horn of Africa  we have witnessed a drasticdownturn in the relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea.Indeed  the armies of those two fraternal countries —forced by history  geography and culture to live in perfectharmony and peace — launched military operations. Andyet there have been numerous initiatives designed to bringabout a political solution of this new conflict. Thebrotherly Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea shouldagree to sit down at the negotiating table and endeavour with the help of the current Chairman of the OAU  thecountries of the subregion and other participants ofgoodwill  to find ways and means of reaching a peacefulsolution.Elsewhere on the continent  in Angola and inSomalia  the road to peace is winding — if nottortuous — and uncertainty continues to prevail.Allow me to pay once again from this rostrum arespectful tribute to the memory of Matre AliouneBlondin Beye  Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Angola  and of his companions in misfortune who included our fellow countryman Moctar Gueye  ajournalist  all of whom died in an accident on the field ofhonour in the service of peace.All of Africa aspires to progress and to a better life even though the conflicts it is enduring continue to posemajor obstacles to a balanced and lasting economic andsocial development. We therefore have the obligation andthe duty  as members of the family of nations  to continueto strive to bring about a world order that is more stable equitable and just.Aware of this reality  Africans together  working inconcert with the OAU and in close cooperation with theUnited Nations  are participating more and more actively3in regional efforts aimed at conflict prevention management and resolution.I should like to take this opportunity to welcome thepublication of the Secretary-General?s report on the causesof conflict and the promotion of durable peace andsustainable development in Africa. In this invaluable report the Secretary-General offers a well thought out andobjective analysis of the causes of conflicts in Africa rightly pinpointing the close link between stability anddevelopment  and finally recommending criteria  conditionsand ways and means of ensuring  building and safeguardingpeace in the interest of sustainable development in Africa.My country  Senegal  convinced of the importance ofpeace in the Middle East and of the need for greaterprogress in that respect  is actively supporting the peaceprocess and remains committed to the achievement of peacein the region based on the relevant resolutions andagreements  which must be respected by all parties  if onlyon the basis of the principle of pacta sunt servanda.The time is ripe urgently to call once again on theparties involved  the co-sponsors and all peace-lovingnations to ensure that fresh initiatives are taken to reconcilethe widely divergent viewpoints of the Palestinian Authorityand the Government of Israel in order to restore a climateof confidence and cooperation  which is the only possiblebasis for peace and peaceful coexistence among the peoplesof the region.Ongoing efforts to bring about general  complete andverifiable disarmament represent a major step instrengthening international security. While significantprogress has been made in this realm in the past decade  wemust acknowledge that global disarmament  today morethan ever  remains a long-range objective.Indeed  the conflicts we have seen in recent years havedemonstrated that the massive destruction caused byconventional arms requires that initiatives be taken to detertheir proliferation  and in particular the illicit traffic insmall-calibre weapons  now a real scourge in Africa. Majorefforts are being mobilized on the continent to fight thisthreat  but it is obvious that Africa alone cannot possiblyovercome it. Senegal will spare no effort to contribute tothe elaboration of an international convention to fight theillicit traffic in small-calibre weapons.At the dawn of the twenty-first century  the universalcharacter of the United Nations has achieved wideacceptance  and its universality gives our Organizationgreater credibility and effectiveness.In keeping with this principle  Senegal unreservedlysupports the request by the Republic of China to rejointhe community of free nations and to be admitted as amember of our Organization and of its specializedagencies. Accordingly  we have proposed that the GeneralAssembly reconsider that part of resolution 2758 (XXVI)that excluded the Republic of China from the UnitedNations and from its specialized agencies.In keeping with its purpose — to be a centre wherenations work together for social progress through theachievement of improved living conditions — the UnitedNations has made a remarkable contribution topinpointing the problems facing humankind.Throughout this decade  the United Nations has helda series of major conferences that have enabled theinternational community to adopt at the highest politicallevel a set of consensual plans of action. These have laidthe foundation for a new global partnership fordevelopment based upon the principle of nationalresponsibility and the imperative of internationalsolidarity  in the quest for a united response to thechallenges that face all of us. Never before has sogenerous and so highly promising an approach been takento the concerns felt by the community of nations.These action plans  apart from their degree ofrelevance  constitute a set of formal commitments onmeasures that should be taken together. Without thecorresponding mobilization of new and additionalresources  the specific actions expected from these nobleinitiatives  whose grandeur and legitimacy derive theirvery force from the ideals embodied in the Charter itself are liable to translate into severely compromised ordashed hopes.Above and beyond the problems linked toimplementing the results of the major conferences heldthroughout the decade  the fact is that internationalcooperation for development now poses a paradox that wecannot ignore without betraying the ideals of peace anddevelopment that inspired the founding fathers of ourOrganization.4Miguel de Unamuno  Rector of the University ofSalamanca in Spain  once said:“Under certain circumstances  to keep silent is to lie”.How  then  can we remain silent before the obviouscontradiction between the incessant expansion of needs foreconomic cooperation for development and the constantdecline in official development assistance  which is todayat its lowest level in 25 years? How can we forget thepersistent imbalances in multilateral international trade whose first and foremost role was  after all  to ensure foreveryone  in developed and developing countries alike  thebenefits of a trading mechanism that was to be open regulated  transparent  equitable and predictable? Whatvalues of humanity can still be invoked when at the dawnof the third millennium  in a world that has become aglobal village  over a billion men and women are deprivedof even the barest elements of a decent life? Themarginalization and exclusion that haunt the daily lives ofthese men and women give proof once again of theabsolute priority that the fight against poverty must have atboth the national and international levels.This is why strong measures to breathe new life intoNorth-South exchanges are today more imperative thanever. The General Assembly?s high-level debate devoted torelaunching a dialogue to strengthen internationalcooperation through partnership and the draft plan for aninternational gathering at the highest level for developmentfinancing are encouraging initiatives  as would be initiativesfor fair compensation for commodities and a globalsettlement of the debt crisis of developing countries.The fifty-third session of the General Assemblycoincides with the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. The promotion  consolidationand expansion of the underpinnings of the State based onthe rule of law throughout the world; the strengthening ofnational institutions for the defence of human rights; theintegration of human rights into the major activities of theUnited Nations system; the promotion of the right todevelopment — these seem to us to be the essential pillarsof a global policy for the benefit of human rights andfreedoms at the end of this century.In this context  my delegation would like to salute themajor initiatives undertaken by Mrs. Mary Robinson  HighCommissioner for Human Rights since she took office particularly those directed to our continent  Africa  whichare fully in keeping with our expectations. This means  infact  that more than ever before  we must promote dialoguewith Governments  strengthen dialogue betweeninstitutions within the United Nations system and strive torationalize the machinery of human rights.The fight against the global drug problem remains aconcern shared by the entire international communitybecause of the multiple and pernicious ties that drug-trafficking has been able to establish with phenomenasuch as transnational organized crime  terrorism  large-scale banditry and illegal arms-trafficking networks —particularly those involving small calibre weapons especially in Africa. This illicit trafficking in narcoticsand psychotropic substances has become a dangerousthreat to the peace  stability and security of all nations States and regions of the world at the end of themillennium.This is why my country  Senegal  welcomed theholding last June in the presence of numerous heads ofState and of Government in this Hall of the specialsession of the General Assembly devoted to the drugproblem. Now it is important for all of us to work for theeffective implementation of the important conclusionsreached at that meeting  both at the national andinternational levels.Before I conclude  allow me to say a few wordsabout the financial crisis and the need to strengthen theeffectiveness of the United Nations. Our Organization hasbeen in the midst of a very worrisome financial situationfor several years now. The causes of this situation havebeen debated at length right here and it does not seemnecessary for me to recall them now. I would simply liketo stress that the reform process that we have allundertaken cannot possibly be brought to a successfulconclusion within this situation of financial instability thatthe Organization is experiencing at a time when it isbeing called upon to act on many different fronts.The new international context  and themultidimensional nature of the challenges to be metrequire that we have a restructured and modernizedUnited Nations that is endowed with the capabilitiesnecessary to come to our help in resolving our disputes eliminating injustices and disparities and avoidingexclusion and selfishness.It is enough for us to want these things  because wepossess the resources and capabilities to attain them.Humanity has already met so many challenges in thecourse of its troubled history that we can have no doubt5now that it is indeed capable of meeting the challenges ofthe third millennium as well.So far as we are concerned in Senegal  under theleadership of Mr. Abdou Diouf  President of the Republic we are ready to shoulder our responsibilities in a genuinespirit of solidarity and collective effort in order to realizeour ambitions and dreams. We owe it to ourselves  butespecially to the generations to come."
"146",6183,"SGP",53,1998,"Singapore was delightedto see Mr. Didier Opertti unanimously elected as the fifty-third President of the United Nations General Assembly. Asthis century draws to a close  the world is experiencingdramatic changes. We live in an era of great uncertainties.At this crucial juncture  we are delighted that adistinguished man of letters and man of law from a fellowsmall State has assumed this distinguished office. Wewould also like to place on record our gratitude to hispredecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for his ablestewardship of the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly.In the last two decades  the world has changed. Thegrowth of international institutions  cross-border trade andinvestment  the opening up of markets  the advent ofinstant communication — all these have altered the faceof the world. From the Americas to Europe to the MiddleEast  to Africa and to Asia  no country has beenuntouched by the forces of globalization. The expansionof global economic activity has forced globalization ontothe agendas of United Nations Members. At one point oranother  we have all asked how our peoples could benefitfrom globalization and wondered how our nations couldbe better plugged into the global economic grid. Keeninternational interest at the United Nations aboutglobalization was also evident from the activeparticipation of many Member States in the high-leveldialogue on the impact of globalization held last week onthe fringes of the General Assembly.At that dialogue  Secretary-General Kofi Annan saidthat there was no subject more important thanglobalization. I agree. The long-term benefits derivingfrom the free trade of goods and services and from thefree flow of capital and information are generallyaccepted.In the last year the desirability of a freer flow ofcapital has been severely questioned. When the currencycrisis erupted in South-East Asia  some expected the crisisto blow over quickly. Unfortunately  this was not thecase. Economic problems quickly developed into full-scale social problems  which in turn became politicalproblems. The crisis has since spread from South-EastAsia to North-East Asia  Russia and even Latin America.Even as we speak  it laps at the shores of America andEurope. What started out as a national problem hasballooned into a regional problem  and it is fastthreatening to become a global crisis.The United Nations cannot avoid coming to gripswith globalization. Events in East Asia over the last yearhave caused enthusiasm for this phenomenon to give wayto uncertainty about its value. The questions foremost inour minds are: is globalization good for us? How do weprevent ourselves from being hurt by it? We are allgroping for answers. The challenge for us is whether weare able to draw the right lessons from recent events.On the whole  globalization has done a lot of good.The process has enhanced the free flow of goods andservices  capital and information; it has spurred innovationand competition and has lifted hundreds of million ofpeople out of poverty. East Asia has enjoyed two decadesof unprecedented economic growth. Our landscape hasbeen radically transformed. Financial centres have14replaced sleepy villages. Lifestyles which were a dream forour parents are a reality for us. Our cities are increasinglyplugged into the world information superhighway. Less than10 years ago  letters would have taken at least a week tocross the globe. Today  with the advent of electronic mail it takes seconds. We can now chat “real-time” on theInternet. Initially  the Internet was used mainly in developedcountries. Increasingly  it has spread its wings around theglobe.Dialogue and cooperation between countries haveimproved as the countries found issues of common interestand more areas of interdependence. Isolated economieshave joined hands to form regional economic groupings andto promote regional prosperity. Look how the globalizationof information has helped the work of the United Nationsitself. Today  anyone with a computer and modem can gainelectronic access to over 360 000 official documents of theUnited Nations  dating back to 1947. The complete list ofUnited Nations peacekeeping operations  including potentialtraining programmes  is available on-line. More crucially the Organization’s “Relief Web” provides situation reportson humanitarian relief efforts in disaster areas around theworld  along with instant information on how individualsand Governments can contribute to specific humanitarianoperations. One major force of globalization  the Internet has tied all of us together  very much like a global family.But  like any man-made phenomenon  globalizationinevitably creates some problems. Some countries havebeen made more vulnerable by the opening up of theireconomies to the global market. Control has now passedlargely into the hands of thousands of money traders whocan move billions of dollars across boundaries with a singleclick of a computer mouse. Effectively  there is now no realforce that can stop them.As the former Chairman of Citibank  Mr. WalterWriston  noted in a recent article:“When I started in the banking business  the totalforeign exchange market in New York was only about$50 million. If the Federal Reserve called Citibank orChase and instructed them to sell $10 million  anorder that size could move the markets. Today  thatmarket is $1 trillion and Central Bank intervention inforeign exchange becomes an exercise in futility.”In today’s CNN world  live images are transmittedfrom one end of the globe to another as events unfold.Perceptions can be changed  emotions stoked andconfidence irrecoverably shaken within minutes. This exertsgreater pressures on Governments  on businesses and evenon peoples to respond  rationally or otherwise.The way ahead is not to turn our backs onglobalization. This is no longer a viable or realisticoption. To repudiate globalization will hurt our long-termgrowth prospects. It is vital to remind ourselves in thiscrisis that the tremendous economic growth that much ofthe world has experienced since the Second World Warhas been the result of the free trade in goods and servicesencouraged since the formation of the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade in 1947. There is an overwhelmingconsensus among economists that we should continue topush ahead on this front  despite the fact thatprotectionism has once again reared its ugly head. If wetry to turn the clock back and walk away from free trade the impact will not just be domestic nor will it be merelyeconomic.Domestic political pressures can find regional andinternational outlets. The prosperity resulting from openmarkets has provided a foundation for national stabilityand regional and global peace and security. If countriescannot get access to the raw materials  goods and servicesthey need through peaceful and open competition  theywill resort to other means. Economic rivalries can havepolitical and military consequences. A return to globaltensions cannot be ruled out  but we must avoid it. Thecore interests of the United Nations — the maintenanceof peace and security — may be endangered. The onlyway forward is to find solutions to deal with thevulnerabilities created by globalization.At the domestic level  we must promote higherstandards of national government by strengthening ourregulatory and supervisory frameworks  improvingcorporate governance  increasing transparency andlessening government interference in market decisions.We need to put in place sound macroeconomic policiesand build strong regulatory structures to make oureconomies more resilient.On the international front  the United Nations canplay a leading role in the international effort to helpcountries reap the benefits of globalization. We shouldencourage the developed world to assume the primaryresponsibility for bringing the world out of this crisis.There should be greater dialogue and partnership betweenthe developing and developed world to ensure thatglobalization benefits every country. Globalization shouldbring security and confidence  not greater vulnerability  toour people.15United Nations Members have a common interest inrevitalizing and reforming the major multilateralinstitutions  including the International Monetary Fund(IMF)  the World Bank and the World Trade Organization(WTO). The United Nations  for its part  has prevented thescourge of another world war. The IMF  World Bank andWTO have overseen a great burst of economic expansionof a size never seen before in the history of man. Togetherwith other key United Nations agencies  they have madesignificant contributions to development efforts and topoverty alleviation. However  recent developments haveshown that these institutions have their weaknesses. Theyshould be reformed  but not destroyed.So  we at the United Nations can play a constructiverole in this process. As Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annansaid at the high-level dialogue recently  the United Nationshas”A unique and indispensable role to play. Our broadmandate  our universal membership and our ability toinvolve non-State actors all make the United Nationsuniquely well equipped to help forge a global responseto the crisis  which is global not only in thegeographical sense  but also in the range of issues thatit raises.” (A/53/PV.6)I am glad that one clear conclusion of the high-leveldialogue on globalization was  as the Secretary-Generalreiterated in his closing remarks  the need for the UnitedNations and Bretton Woods institutions to now worktogether as equal members of the same team. In my view we will also have to work together to deal with the newchallenges which were not anticipated when the BrettonWoods institutions were set up in 1944.We stand at a critical juncture of internationaldiscourse. As we approach the twenty-first century paradigms that have brought us wealth and peace in the lasthalf-century are now being questioned. The temptation totake the easiest route — to close our doors onglobalization — is very great  but the quickest route is notnecessarily the right or best route.We can begin by holding full discussions on this issue.A good start was made at the recent high-level dialogue.Many good ideas have been raised. We should continue thisprocess in order to come up with a global understanding ofthe challenges and to formulate a global response. I ampleased to learn that preparations have already begun forthe Millennium Assembly in the year 2000. Many questionswill certainly be discussed then  but I dare say that noquestion may be more pressing than the challenge ofglobalization."
"147",6216,"SLB",53,1998,"The word“globalization” did not appear in dictionaries of theEnglish language 30 years ago. Globalization is now areality  but multitudes do not benefit. To assist thosepeoples suffering its negative consequences  the UnitedNations requires skilled and innovative leadership. TheGeneral Assembly is fortunate that Mr. Opertti has beenelected to lead it at its fifty-third session. His service tohis country and intergovernmental organizations at thehighest levels and his experience as a teacher  scholar andpractitioner of international law  with extensive work ineconomic development and trade  as well as crimeprevention and the protection of children  demonstrate theunderstanding and patience required here.My delegation applauds the achievements ofMr. Hennadiy Udovenko  President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-second session who time and againdemonstrated the dexterity and humour necessary foradvancing the delicate process of United Nations reform which Solomon Islands wholeheartedly supports. In theSecretary-General Kofi Annan  who continues to nurturethat process  this Organization has found one of the greatmen of our time. We are honoured by his presence.Having often spoken strongly in favour of genderequality  my delegation rejoiced in the election ofMs. Louise Frechette as the first Deputy Secretary-General. She and the Secretary-General admirablyrepresent the indispensable Secretariat.On the eve of the new millennium  many developingcountries continue to experience difficult economic environmental and social problems. The lack of capitalresources  crushing debt  external economic shocks and thefall in development assistance retard the growth of theeconomies of many least developed countries. The smallisland developing States continue to experience growth indrug and other transborder crimes. Moreover  our peopleface the ever present threat of natural disaster  such as thedevastating tsunami that recently struck Papua New Guinea our nearby neighbour.We are a village people feeling the impact ofglobalization. The vulnerability of small island developingStates to external economic shock is indeed real. Our tinyeconomy means a narrow human and non-human resourcesbase and a limited domestic market. We are dangerouslyexposed to external economic developments in trade  capitalflows and technology. Limited in our capacity to stabilizeour domestic economy  we are especially sensitive to anddependent on the international situation. Our inability toeffectively deal with the impacts of the Asian financialcrisis demonstrates our vulnerability. The drop in mycountry’s export revenue further undermines our difficultfinancial and economic situation. Well-designed andcarefully monitored international standards and codes ofconduct for capital flows and private financial managementare essential. Without such regulatory measures  theprospects that the least developed countries will benefitfrom globalization and trade liberalization remain bleak. Weface even further marginalization.The Alliance for Change Government of SolomonIslands is well aware that whether we and other leastdeveloped countries succeed in effectively using theopportunities and mitigating the risks offered by the newworld trading system depends largely on our success inmaking major macroeconomic policy reforms andovercoming deficiencies. To stimulate private sectorinvolvement and the active participation of indigenousSolomon Islanders  the Government has launched a reformprogramme incorporating sound banking and financialpractices conducive to economic growth and stability. Thepublic sector is being restructured to create more efficient responsive and accountable governmental administration.We cannot succeed  however  without significantbilateral and multilateral assistance. The experience of othereconomies that have undertaken similar programmes showsthat the reforms can be accelerated by assured markets fortraditional products as well as access to new markets andcapital. Moreover  multilateral agencies such as the UnitedNations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) andthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) canassist significantly in enhancing competitiveness andcapacity-building.Communications and information technology are  ofcourse  essential for economic revitalization  especially sofor Solomon Islands and other small island developingStates remote from major markets and financial centres.My Government is committed to the development ofefficient and cost-effective telecommunication networksas a catalyst for economic and social progress. We arealso supporting long-distance education by radio andcampaigns to reduce and eliminate illiteracy.Sustainable development and the scientificmanagement of our forest and marine resources remainhigh priority matters for my Government. The 922 islandsand atolls of the Solomons stretch over 1.35 millionsquare kilometres of ocean. Fisheries are essential for oureconomy. Last April  Parliament enacted legislation tocontrol the exploitation of our fish resources and tomaximize the benefits for our people. Protecting thefragile marine ecosystem from pollution is a majorconcern. With the assistance of the UNDP  a study willsoon be undertaken to assess the potential danger to themarine environment posed by the large quantity ofsubmerged ordnance from the Second World War.Projects to encourage ecotourism as well as theprocessing of forest products within the Solomon Islandsare being considered.The special session of the General Assembly nextyear to review the overall implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States promises to be animportant occasion to assess the progress made in the lastfive years. Solomon Islands will participate actively in thepreparatory work and in the seventh session of theCommission on Sustainable Development and the donorsconference on small island developing States.Natural disaster remains the greatest environmentalthreat to the peoples of many small island nations. Weface such calamities as tidal waves and volcaniceruptions  hurricanes  droughts and floods and rise of thesea level from climate warming. During the past year shortages of water and food caused by El Niño severelyaffected Solomon Islands and several other countries inthe region  especially where cyclones had struck earlier.Intensified international cooperation in early warningsystems  disaster mitigation and management strategiesare needed. We strongly support the renewal of the2United Nations International Decade for Disaster Reductionand related initiatives.Climate change remains an issue demanding urgentand concrete global collective attention. The KyotoProtocol  which Solomon Islands signed a few days ago  isa positive step within the climate protection process  but itmust be understood to be only one of several. Crucialactions  besides the early ratification of the Protocol by allparties  include the strengthening of emission reductiontargets and commitment to agreed time frames byindustrialized countries and the development and transfer ofappropriate  affordable and environmentally soundtechnologies. International commitments to energyefficiency and the development of renewable energysources remain key objectives. For small island developingStates to meet their obligations  adequate resources must begenerated through the mechanisms provided by the Protocoland the Global Environment Facility. These are priorityissues for the fourth session of the Conference of theParties to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change  meeting in Buenos Aires next month.Other potential disasters concern us as well. Theproliferation of nuclear weapons is especially troubling tomy Government. Solomon Islands is committed to theelimination of these weapons and is proud of the part ittook at the International Court of Justice on the issue ofnuclear weapons. These instruments of terror are creatinginsecurity in our region. We are also committed to theelimination of biological and chemical weapons. Thecoming entry into force next March of the OttawaConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction is splendid news indeed  and we thankAustria  Canada  Norway and South Africa for theirextraordinary efforts.In our peaceful islands  the noise of any conflictresounds loudly and threateningly. We are indeed pleasedby the Bougainville peace agreement  which New Zealandskilfully helped to negotiate with the important assistanceof Australia  Fiji and Vanuatu. Crucial for the success ofthis effort was the willingness of the Government of PapuaNew Guinea and the other parties to work in good faith.We also thank France for agreeing to a timetable for theindependence of New Caledonia.The Alliance for Change Government stronglycondemns international terrorism in any form ormanifestation. We deplore in the strongest terms whathappened in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. Solomon Islandssupports the call by previous speakers for the internationalcommunity  in particular the United Nations  to take aleading role in combating terrorism. At the same time  werecognize the need to understand the conditions in whichterrorism is rooted and to change them. The desperateacts of men and women have desperate causes.International partnership is also required in fightingthe world’s illicit drug trade. The declaration adopted atthe twentieth special session of the General Assemblycalls for concrete efforts. My Government is taking thenecessary steps at the national level  but the enhancementof our interdiction capabilities and the encouragement ofalternative economic activities require practicalinternational assistance.The Solomon Islands delegation participated in thepreparation of the Statute of the International CriminalCourt  and we applaud its adoption in Rome. Thechallenge before us now is to ensure its effectiveimplementation.Half a century after the adoption of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  the progress achieved although significant  is far from satisfactory for hundredsof millions of people. Many human rights do not exist except on paper  for the over one billion persons who livein abject poverty. My Government is committed toupholding our people’s fundamental rights  as guaranteedby the Solomon Islands Constitution. We strive tomaintain human dignity. Although resource constraintshinder our ability to fulfil the reporting obligations of theinternational instruments to which we are a party  we willnot fail to meet our human rights obligations. Nor will webe silent when the rights of others are denied.We call once again for the representation andparticipation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in theUnited Nations and its agencies. When the GeneralAssembly refuses to place this matter on its agenda  itdenies to the nearly 22 million people of Taiwan theirrights under the Charter of this Organization. It rejects theopportunity to foster peace and security in the TaiwanStrait through dialogue here at the United Nations. It turnsits back on preventive diplomacy. Surely the GeneralAssembly is better than this. The people of this politicallystable  economically strong and technologically advanceddemocracy have amply demonstrated how much they haveto offer their region and the world. With the newmillennium nearly upon us  it is time to discard oldpatterns of thought if the Chinese motherland is to reunitepeacefully. My Government will continue to appeal to the3United Nations to seriously consider and recognize thelegitimate right of the people of the Republic of China onTaiwan to have a voice in this international arena.During the “reform Assembly”  Solomon Islandssupported the proposals of the Secretary-General. Mydelegation actively participated in the Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Security Council. Reform of the Councilshould move boldly toward greater democracy andtransparency. Expansion of its membership must reflectequitable geographical representation  and close thoughtneeds to be given to the composition of the regional groups.If the veto cannot be decently buried  it should be restrictedto Chapter VII questions.The Secretary-General’s proposal for a MillenniumAssembly in September 2000 to identify priorities forUnited Nation action is refreshing. Critical for the successof the Assembly will be the two years of internationaldialogue  involving the widest possible spectrum ofparticipants  leading up to it. The dialogues must truly bedialogues and not long series of monologues in whichpeople talk past one another. A leading candidate for oneof the priorities to be adopted by the Millennium Assemblyis debt forgiveness for the heavily indebted poor countries.Canada  Germany and the United Kingdom are to becommended for their recent debt-forgiving actions. We alsoappreciate the Nordic countries who have fulfilled theirtargets and commitments for official developmentassistance.Solomon Islands celebrated the twentieth anniversaryof its independence last July. The past two decades havebeen difficult but peaceful. My Government wishes toacknowledge the contribution of the internationalcommunity  especially our development partners  includingthe non-governmental organizations. We especially thankour citizens for their patience and support towards ourdevelopment endeavours. We are committed tostrengthening these partnerships. We must work together tomeet the challenges of the next millennium successfully."
"148",6262,"SLE",53,1998,"Permit me to offer  onbehalf of President Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and theGovernment and the people of Sierra Leone  our warmfelicitations to Mr. Didier Opertti on his unanimous electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession  and to express our delegation?s confidence thatunder his able guidance our session will be a successfulone. We are in no doubt that his distinguished public recordadequately equips him for the position he has been calledupon to assume  and we have already seen evidence of thisin the last two weeks. We must also express gratitude to hispredecessor  Mr. Udovenko of Ukraine  for a job well done.Our gratitude also goes to Mr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General  and to the entire staff of the United Nationscommon system for their relentless efforts in helping thepeople of Sierra Leone in the mammoth task ofreconstruction  rehabilitation and resettlement of hundredsof thousands of our compatriots who were the unfortunatevictims of nine months of junta misrule. Mr. Annan hasput the international ship of state on the right course  andmy delegation wishes him continued success.This time last year  my President addressed theAssembly on the subject of the situation in Sierra Leone.I am sure most members will remember the picture hepainted of the tragic events and the turmoil that followedwhen a democratically elected Government wasoverthrown by a bunch of military adventurists  aided andabetted by some civilian opportunists who became theiractive collaborators. Thanks to the resilience of the wholeof civil society  encouraged and backed by theinternational community  I am here today representing thelegitimate  reinstated Government of Sierra Leone.Against all odds  our people defied the violent andmisguided gun-toting anarchists who appeared to haveone objective  and one only: the total destruction of thecivil society of Sierra Leone. Mercifully  that nightmareis now behind us.In February this year  the forces of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)Monitoring Group (ECOMOG)  under the then ECOWASChairman  the late General Sani Abacha of Nigeria  ledby Nigeria and with the support of our Civil DefenceUnit  removed the junta. This was preceded by severalattempts to arrive at a negotiated settlement. Theinternational community was to learn that the junta andtheir allies  the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)  alwaysnegotiated in bad faith and were not to be trusted.The atrocities committed by the junta during theirnine-month reign  especially after they retreated to theeastern and northern parts of the country  had to be seento be believed. Rape  murder  mutilation  vandalism andthe burning down of whole villages were the order of theday. Unarmed civilians  particularly women and children were their unfortunate victims.Because of the wanton destruction perpetrated by thejunta and  much earlier  by the RUF  there is a great needto revamp the economy and for reconstruction. In a reportto the General Assembly  the Secretary-General referredto the Special Conference on Sierra Leone  which heconvened here at United Nations Headquarters on 30 Julythis year. The international community was invited tofocus on the situation in Sierra Leone.21We were very much encouraged  not only by thedeliberations and results of that conference  but also by thedeliberations of the second ministerial-level SecurityCouncil meeting on Africa  held last week  in which SierraLeone featured prominently.The humanitarian crisis is immense: there are manyrefugees and displaced persons. The disarmament anddemobilization exercise and the resettlement  rehabilitationand reconstruction processes require many resources. Someof the pledges that were made are now being fulfilled  butmuch remains to be done.Allow me to echo the appeal of the Secretary-Generalto those who have yet to pledge  and to others who haveyet to deliver  to do all they can to help us. In themeantime  I would like to express profound gratitude to allmembers  and especially to the members of the contactgroup to be coordinated by the United Kingdom  for whathas been achieved so far.As soon as the legitimate Government wasoverthrown  the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  atits meeting in Harare in June 1997  unanimouslycondemned the takeover and called on the junta to returnpower and constitutionality to the elected Government andto the country respectively. The prompt action ofECOWAS  the resultant peace in Liberia and now thereturn of democracy to Sierra Leone  clearly demonstratewhat a regional organization can achieve if thedetermination and the leadership are there. ECOMOG hasthe capacity to deliver  but it needs the tools  which onlythe international community can provide.My country is fully aware that even though the ArmedForces Revolutionary Council (AFRC)/RUF junta has beenousted  the peace and security that were achieved withenormous sacrifice by the people of Sierra Leone have yetto be consolidated. It is therefore in the interests of thepeople that the international community in general and theforces of the subregion in particular  maintain their presencein Sierra Leone until we can create a new national army. Inthis regard  the Federal Republic of Nigeria has agreed tothe secondment of Brigadier-General Maxwell Khobe Commander of the ECOMOG Force in Sierra Leone  as ourChief of Defence Staff. He is already working on themodalities for forming a well-trained and dedicated armywhich will be alive to its responsibility as defender of ourConstitution. I have every reason to believe that thatassignment will be carried out with the sameprofessionalism that has been the hallmark of ECOMOGoperations in both Liberia and Sierra Leone.At this juncture  I would like to state that theGovernment of the Republic of Sierra Leone is committedto the demobilization  disarmament and integration of allex-combatants  as provided for in both the Abidjan PeaceAccord and the Conakry peace plan  despite the lack ofgood faith that has been demonstrated by both the RUFand the junta. This programme is at the top of our post-conflict agenda  and the Disarmament Committee itself isunder the chairmanship of no less a person than ourPresident.Because of its overwhelming desire to uphold theprinciples of democracy and good governance  theGovernment lays much emphasis on the rule of law human rights and freedom of expression. There are over48 newspaper publications in a country with 80 per centilliteracy. Despite propaganda to the contrary  nojournalists have been prosecuted  let alone convicted  forpractising their profession — not even when the headlinesof a few have sometimes bordered on libel. Of the 16people recently convicted of treason  after a trial that wasdeclared transparent and fair  five were journalists; butthey were not charged for the practice of journalism.President Kabbah and the ECOMOG ForceCommander informed the Special Conference on SierraLeone that more than 90 per cent of the country wassecure and safe. Remnants of the junta and the RUF are however  perched in small areas in the east and north-eastand operate only because they continue to have a safehaven in a neighbouring country  while one other countryrenders its support to them from outside Sierra Leone.That notwithstanding  every effort is now being made byboth ECOMOG and the Civil Defence Unit to flush themout and to finally put this whole tragic affair behind us.The treason trials of both civilians and former juntamembers are still in progress  under laws which havebeen in existence since independence. Soon after sentencewas passed on the first group  some misguidedorganizations began unfairly pressurizing the President tointervene; they even mounted a vicious propagandacampaign in the name of human rights.My country is governed by the rule of law. Underour constitution there is separation of powers between theexecutive  the legislature and the judiciary. While the dueprocess of law is in progress  the President cannot andwill not interfere with it. At the end of the exercise thosewho lose their final appeals to the Supreme Court canapply to the Prerogative of Mercy Committee. Then  and22only then  will the President step in  and he has alreadygiven that assurance.Our President has not only gone the extra mile  but isseen to be bending over backwards to bring together all themain political groups into the mainstream of the post-conflict nation-building exercise  so as to secure permanentpeace and security. There have been no instances of humanrights violations since President Kabbah assumed office.With regard to the armed rebellion in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and the rebel wars in Angola  Sudanand elsewhere  we appeal to the parties in those conflicts tolay down their arms  to refrain from further provocativeactivities that ignite tempers and to give peace a chance.Our Government welcomes the successful outcome ofthe United Nations Diplomatic Conference on theestablishment of the International Criminal Court  whichtook place in Rome  Italy  in June 1998. Sierra Leone isfirmly committed to the early establishment of a permanentinternational court  and my Government has already signedthe Statute of the International Criminal Court. We urgeevery nation to sign and ratify the Statute. It will be notonly testimony to the common desire to overcome longneglected failures of national legal systems  but a uniquechance to contribute to international stability deterrenceand  hopefully  the prevention of atrocious crimes.Security Council reform is one of the most difficultissues which have to be tackled during this session. Whileprogress has been made in some areas  and new ideas andproposals have emerged  the Working Group has notpresented recommendations to the General Assembly. SierraLeone agrees with the position of the Non-AlignedMovement on the curtailment  limitation and subsequentelimination of the veto. Sierra Leone fully endorses thedecision of the Assembly of the Heads of State orGovernment of the Organization of African Unity for twopermanent seats to be allocated to our continent.As for the expansion of the Security Council  SierraLeone supports the position taken by the Non-AlignedMovement  that  in order to enhance its credibility  the newCouncil should reflect the universal character of the worldand correct existing imbalances in its composition.My country cannot talk of conflicts and peace withoutreferring to nuclear arms. When negotiations were beingconducted in Geneva on a comprehensive test-ban treaty  afew years ago  the Republic of Sierra Leone was one ofthose countries which prayed silently for its success. Weare relieved and thankful that the Treaty has been signedby a large number of countries. We continue to call on allnations to sign the test-ban treaty and refrain from furthertests  with their attendant danger to the future of mankind.In the same way as we oppose all future nucleartests  we must with all the emphasis at our disposalcondemn all forms of terrorism  both domestic andinternational. We refer particularly to the recent bombingswhich claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent people not to mention the loss of property worth millions ofdollars in Nairobi  Dar-es-Salaam  Cape Town andNorthern Ireland. We call on the international communityto coordinate its efforts to fight this menace. Those whoinsist on using this method to achieve their aims shouldbe tracked down and brought to justice. In this regard  mycountry wholeheartedly supports the signing andratification of all the Conventions on terrorism andappeals to the entire international community to adhere tothe Conventions in order to make the world a safer placefor our children?s children.My Government noted with great delight theconference convened last year in South Africa to focusthe world?s attention on the dangers posed to human lifeby landmines. We revive the memory of the late PrincessDiana  who did so much to focus the attention of theinternational community on the horrors of landmines. Inour own country  too  landmines were strewn around withcarefree abandon by the AFRC/RUF junta  resulting inthe maiming and death of innocent civilians  especiallychildren.Many African and other third world countries including my own  are today still grappling with severeeconomic problems. The effects of the debt burden  theunfavourable balances of trade and payment  and theunpredictability of the prices of their products on theworld market have all contributed to the deterioratingeconomic conditions they are facing. In addition to theseexternal factors  misguided policies and politicalinstability caused by various kinds of civil strife havecaused their economies to sink further. Globalization andtrade liberalization have become inevitable phases inworld trade. It has  however  become obvious that ourcountries have fared badly and will continue to be at adisadvantage unless there is a change of attitude and evenprocedure on the part of developed  industrializedcountries. The resultant imbalances can be overcome ifevery effort is made to create a level playing field byremoving the debt burden of our countries and opening upmarkets to African and third world products. Some23countries have already done so; we hope that others willfollow soon.I have already mentioned the refugee situation in myown country. It is grim  and yet the situation is the same inother parts of the world  especially Africa  which has thelargest refugee populations. This situation has continued toexert tremendous pressure on the already weak economiesof the host countries  which are forced to spend part oftheir meagre resources on the welfare of refugees. Havinggone through this experience both as recipient and exporterof refugees  we must commend the donor community andespecially the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Much is being donefor us  but even the Office acknowledges that the situationof our refugees in neighbouring countries is desperate. Iwould like to appeal to the donor community to shed itsdonor fatigue syndrome and continue to respond positivelyto the needs of a people who are the innocent victims ofevents not of their own making. A very urgent need now isfor the repatriation of our people from neighbouringcountries  where life in camps is now a nightmare.Sierra Leone is one of the countries in our subregionthat still have the remnants of what were once the UpperGuinea rain forest  which stretches from Sierra Leone downto the Cameroons. The reserve supports the largest numberof animal species in Sierra Leone: a total of 46 mammalspecies  including Western chimpanzees  red colobusmonkeys  Diana monkeys  duickers  leopards and forestelephants. Two hundred and seventy four species of birdsare to be found in the Gola rain forest. These include 10globally threatened species — 8 restricted to the UpperGuinea forest block — and 169 forest-dependent species.There is a very rich diversity of interesting invertebrates including two species of dragonfly  endemic only to partsof the Upper Guinea forest  as well as the rare Africanswallow-tailed butterfly  which has Sierra Leone as thewesternmost limit of its range in Africa.Unfortunately  the Gola rain forest  like most otherforest areas on the continent  is under considerable pressure.Much of the forest cover is lost annually from logging andfrom brush burning as well as shifting cultivation carriedout by an ever-increasing population. Conservation of theseforests in Sierra Leone  as in other parts of Africa  is linkedwith poverty. The Forestry Division of our Ministry ofAgriculture and the Environment has a Gola Rain ForestConservation Programme. The programme is being operatedin collaboration with a local non-governmental organization the Conservation Society of Sierra Leone  the Sierra Leonepartner of Birdlife International  which sponsors theprogramme.Notwithstanding this valuable work  pressure onforests in the third world will not be reduced unless weenhance food production from the same piece of land yearafter year  as happens in the industrialized countries. Thiscan only be achieved by a transfer of food productiontechnology to our own countries.I have made frequent references to the role of theinternational community in the restoration of democracyto my country and to the reinstatement of PresidentKabbah. I have mentioned the United Nations  the OAU ECOWAS and the Commonwealth. I would like to makespecial reference to the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP).The restoration of constitutional order and thevarious efforts of the Government to effect durable peaceand to rebuild the country provide us with an opportunityto regain donor confidence and ensure the completion ofvarious initiatives and programmes interrupted by theevents of the coup of 25 May 1997.As lead agency in the partnership between theGovernment and the donor community  the UNDP  priorto the coup  had spearheaded the following: preparationof a national poverty-eradication programme; facilitatingthe establishment of a coordination mechanism for reliefassistance by the humanitarian community; andfacilitating the peace process through the provision ofdiplomatic  logistic  technical and administrative supportto the peace negotiations and the preparation of thedemobilization programme. Since the return of the electedGovernment in March 1998  the UNDP has spentconsiderable amounts of money in the development ofvarious other programmes as well. I urge the internationalcommunity to continue its support for these programmesand to help us in our task of rehabilitation.Let me close by referring again to the report of theSecretary-General  whom I have already thanked. I shallrefer once more to the special conference he convened for which I thank the Secretary-General."
"149",6309,"SLV",53,1998,"Allow me to begin by expressing our sorrow at the loss ofhuman life and the material damage caused by theinclemencies of nature in our sister nations of theCaribbean. We feel the greatest solidarity with them andurge the international community quickly and generously toprovide them with emergency assistance to deal with thiscrisis.We would like to extend to you  Sir  our sincerecongratulations on your election to preside over this sessionof the General Assembly. We are particularly delighted byyour election  as we enjoy excellent relations of friendshipand cooperation with your country.We would also like to extend our thanks to yourpredecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for his work inpromoting the objectives of the United Nations particularly in the area of encouraging reform of thisOrganization.We extend our thanks to the Secretary-General forhis excellent work in discharge of his mandate in anextremely complex international situation in which a greatvariety of interests are represented.This will be my last participation here as Presidentof the Republic of El Salvador  and I should thereforelike to reiterate our appreciation to this Organization forhaving been a decisive factor in the signing andverification of the Peace Accords that ended the armedconflict in El Salvador.From the beginning of our Administration  wedeclared our political will and our Government?scommitment to comply fully with the Peace Accords  andwe are pleased to say we have done so  despite thedifficulties and obstacles encountered along the way.We can say that profound transformations have takenplace in El Salvador  resulting in the replacement ofauthoritarianism  abuse of power and impunity by asystem founded on strict respect for the law and theprinciples and values of democracy.The restoration of peace and the consolidation ofdemocracy have enabled the state of law in El Salvador tobe strengthened  guaranteeing full independence for thebasic organs of the Government of our Republic  as well asrespect for the rights of the individual. We have also beenable to proceed with a strategy of economic and socialdevelopment with emphasis on the eradication of theunderlying causes of poverty.El Salvador now has a solid economy that is growingprogressively and is internationally recognized and trusted.We are carrying out a successful plan for modernizing thecountry  seeking greater efficiency  productivity andcompetitiveness; one important component of this approachis the elimination of State monopolies through theprivatization of such sectors as energy  telecommunicationsand social security.We are implementing an economic policy ofpromoting our exports and attracting foreign investment with a view to stimulating production  creating more jobsand making better use of the opening of internationalmarkets.We have focused on programmes for promotinghuman resources and the progress of communities especially in the neediest and most vulnerable sectors ofsociety. To this end  we have allocated increasingpercentages of our national budget to education  health andhousing. As part of our strategy for fighting againstpoverty  the National Department for the Family is carryingout support programmes for women  children and theelderly.Because we attach great importance to the ecology  wehave established a Ministry of the Environment and NaturalResources and we have now adopted a special law on thisissue  in the aim of seeking solutions to the seriousenvironmental problems facing our country and the world.We are pleased to report that currently we are carryingout consultations across the country on the conclusion of adraft basic agreement for a national plan  involving thegeneral agreement of all the various representative sectorsof El Salvador?s society. Our greatest hope is that thenational plan will encourage participation by all Salvadoranmen and women in a common long-term undertaking inwhich the interests of all are intertwined  withoutdistinctions or political or ideological conditions  and whichwill be established as the nation?s second great politicalagreement  after the Peace Accords.El Salvador fully supports Central Americanintegration  and along with the other Governments andprivate sectors in the region we are updating our legalinstruments and strengthening the institutions that makeup this system of regional integration.From a multilateral perspective  we can say that wehave participated in and supported the declarations andplans of action adopted at international summits andconferences  responsibly shouldering our commitments inthe areas of environment  human rights  social issues development of women  rights of the child  populationand the fight against drug abuse  inter alia.The profound changes that have taken place inrecent years have had a strong impact on the internationalsystem  including the United Nations  resulting inagreement on the need for restructuring so as to respondproperly to and solve global problems  particularly thoseof the developing countries.We believe that Member States must join forces  actin solidarity with each other  shoulder theirresponsibilities and reach agreements to promote thechanges that are needed in the United Nations so that itcan fully discharge its mandate.We support implementation of the Secretary-General?s proposals to complete the restructuring of theSecretariat  and we advocate a change in attitude so thatthere can be real reform in the Security Council and theEconomic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies.We need a Security Council that is more transparent democratic and representative  so that it can enjoy thesupport of all Members of the Organization  andaccordingly can become more effective in adoptingpractical and efficient measures to prevent and resolveconflicts.We are pleased that progress has been made in thepolitical situation worldwide  but we must express ourconcern over the fragile state of peace and stability insome parts of the world as a result of continuing conflict failure to implement agreements  deadlocks and possiblebreakdowns in peace processes  acts of terrorism  hostilityand lack of trust among States.We are concerned about the deadlock in the peaceprocess in the Middle East  and we urge the parties toseek a swift solution in accordance with the agreementsmade.2The Preamble to the Charter states that the peoples ofthe United Nations are resolved to save succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war and to unite theirstrength for the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. Unfortunately  not all Member States areconvinced of this or ready to put into practice these ideasso as to achieve the objectives that are of concern to us all.The recent nuclear tests run counter to our efforts toachieve a world free from nuclear weapons. We havesupported every initiative to ensure a safer world for ourpeoples  and  in a spirit of international solidarity  I ampleased to report that earlier this month El Salvadordeposited its instrument of ratification on theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.We believe that terrorism in any of its manifestationsis an affront to the civilized principles of the human raceand constitutes criminal conduct  which we stronglycondemn and which cannot be justified on political ideological  philosophical  ethnic or religious grounds. Weaccordingly condemn the terrorist attacks in Kenya Tanzania  South Africa and Northern Ireland  which tookinnocent lives  wounded thousands and destroyed property.That is why we support Security Council resolution1189 (1998)  which calls on all States and internationalinstitutions to cooperate with and provide support andassistance to investigations with a view to bringing tojustice those who planned and carried out thosereprehensible acts.The Government of El Salvador recognizes andsupports the efforts of the international community stronglyto fight against drug abuse. We reaffirm our commitmentmade in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of DrugDemand Reduction and in the measures to enhanceinternational cooperation  which we adopted during thespecial session of the General Assembly devoted to thedrugs problem last June.The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights and the fifth anniversary of the ViennaDeclaration and Programme of Action will be importantmilestones providing an opportunity for us to think aboutthe progress made and the effective enjoyment offundamental freedoms. They also provide an opportunity forevery State to renew its commitment to comply with theobligations it has entered into  as part of the internationallegal machinery that protects and promotes these rights.El Salvador reaffirms its support for the restorationof the rights of the Republic of China on Taiwan as aState Member of this Organization because we believe itis a matter of justice to respect the sovereign will andaspirations of its people in accordance with the principleof universality enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations.The changes that have occurred in the internationalarena since the end of the cold war have not narrowed thegap between the developed and developing countries —rather  the gap has become wider. The globalization liberalization and interdependence that characterize thenew international order are challenges and opportunitiesof which many of our countries cannot take properadvantage because of the constraints we face. Integratinginto the competitive world requires resources  technologyand financing that go well beyond the national capacitiesof the least developed countries. This situation can beovercome only with the participation of the countries thatare better developed.In his report on the work of the Organization  theSecretary-General said again that the volume of externalassistance to the developing countries has declinedsteadily during the current decade  and much of what isgiven is not appropriate for or aimed at the needs of therecipient countries. El Salvador urges donor countries totry to increase their cooperation for development  andparticularly urges the industrialized countries to facilitateaccess to their markets for products from less developedcountries.The great advances made in recent times in all areasof human knowledge highlight the need to make more ofan effort to resolve the basic problems facing the majorityof the world?s population. If we truly wish to have aworld free from poverty  war  drugs  crime  terrorism andenvironmental degradation  we must join forces so thattogether we can find new mechanisms and new paths ofaction that lead us to a swift solution to the problems andconcerns of our peoples.We appeal for the wisdom and help of the gods ofthe nations to ensure that in all corners of the earth peace harmony  solidarity and progress will reign."
"150",6334,"SMR",53,1998,"On behalf of the Republic of San Marinoand on my own behalf  I wish  first of all  to congratulateMr. Didier Opertti on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly and to wish him all success in his work.I also wish to assure him and the Secretary-General of thefull support of my Government for their unceasing andvaluable efforts.I would also like to take this opportunity to thankMr. Hennadiy Udovenko for his work as President duringthe last session of the General Assembly.1998 is an historic year for our Organization. We arecelebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  which has always been  andtoday remains  a milestone for democracy and for thesafeguard of the inalienable rights of human beings.The Republic of San Marino  during the more than 16centuries of its existence  has always promoted respect forhuman rights. Today more than ever before  the principlescontained in the Declaration represent the essence of acivilized way of living together in modern society.Therefore my Government decided to finance theproject of the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights entitled “Global Dissemination of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights”. This project aimsat making the Declaration accessible and understandable toa wider number of people  by preparing a compendium oftranslations of this important text into 250 of the world’smost widely spoken languages. With this small butmeaningful gesture  San Marino wishes to celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of the Declaration and to make acontribution to the dissemination of the fundamentalhumanitarian principles contained therein.Experience has taught us  at a high cost  that wherethere is no peace  there is no respect for human rights. Ibelieve the United Nations should play an active role in themaintenance of peace  especially where it is weakest andmost precarious. This is vitally important. It should be thepersonal responsibility of every human being to carry outhis or her own duty in the context of the internationalcommunity.Sadly  we have recently once again confrontedanother dramatic issue: the problem of terrorism. Wemust all cooperate to prevent it from spreading anyfarther. We must combat terrorism and condemn it always and by all possible means.Nuclear tests in the Asian region are a new andworrying problem  one that is going to be characteristicour era. This problem could represent the beginning of anew season of anxiety and danger for all mankind if theinternational community  and the United Nations inparticular  is unable to prevent it. The Republic of SanMarino  like many other States  is against any initiativeaimed at provoking an escalation of the nuclear threat andwill do all in its power to prevent this from happening.Our generation  and the ones to come  must not knowthese fears or the destructive ambitions that couldannihilate our entire planet.Unfortunately  in our opinion the presentinternational legal instruments have proven insufficient tofight the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Thisproliferation has taken on a new profile because of thewill to acquire a more influential and prestigious positionat the national and international levels  while the peacefuland constructive uses of this energy are forgotten ordeliberately denied.My country deems that the United Nations must leadthe international community to strengthen thoseinstruments capable of preventing and repressinginternational crimes which until now have merely beenthe object of moral condemnation. With this in mind  ourRepublic took part in the Diplomatic Conference on theEstablishment of an International Criminal Court in Romelast June and July. San Marino contributed to the work ofthe Conference because it is convinced that such a courtcould represent an effective and strong deterrent to crimesagainst peoples or any ethnic group. The court establishedby this Conference will represent not only a hope for butalso an instrument of protection for the victims ofoppression  as well as a point of reference for all thosewho believe in the absolute value of justice and in respectfor human beings.San Marino follows with particular attention thedebate on the death penalty. Our civil and culturalconsciousness entitles us to do so. In 1865  San Marinobecame the first country in Europe to abolish capitalpunishment  though in fact it had not been applied forcenturies. The Government and people of San Marinodeeply believe that death imposed by law cannot represent19a valid protection for society  nor can it be a deterrent tocrime.Our criminal code  in which sanctions have arehabilitative as well as a punitive function  rejects capitalpunishment  defining it as “a residual of vindictive justice”.For these reasons  I wish to express the support of theRepublic of San Marino for all initiatives that  like theresolution adopted this year by the Commission on HumanRights  aim at the abolition or limitation of the deathpenalty.The nations of the world differ geographically ethnically  economically and culturally  but all of them havea common substantial and undeniable responsibility towardsyoung people. If we are not able today to put an end towars and poverty  future generations will have to fightarduous and complex battles arising from the degenerationand wounds that currently afflict humanity  as it movestowards the third millennium.It is a question not only of doing away with age-oldgeopolitical imbalances but  and primarily  of rediscoveringvalues and principles that are capable of offering all peopleof the world  and especially young people  the culturalmeans to fight for freedom  development and mutualunderstanding. That is a challenge based on solidarity andpersonal values. Given that perspective  San Marinoconsiders the moral and professional growth of youngpeople to be a priority. Our school system is based onpersonal development  focuses on the job market andrespect for environment and encourages young people totake part in the social lives of their communities.The need for reform in the United Nations is aconcept widely shared by all Members of this Organization thanks in particular to the input of the Secretary-General who started a slow but irreversible process which will leadto the rationalization and updating of all its principalorgans. Some of those reforms  such as the reform of theSecurity Council  must  because of their significance  beapproved by consensus only — a consensus that sadly isyet to be reached. We have confidence in the steadfastcommitment of the President of the General Assembly andin his substantial role in leading the Working Group on thereform of the Security Council to an equitable andunanimous solution that fully respects the principles of theCharter.San Marino is among those countries that are stronglyconvinced of the need for reform so as to guarantee for theUnited Nations the functions and the role that form thebasis of its nature and its existence. We are absolutelyaware of how important it is for the Organization tostrengthen its presence and its prestige  which derive frommore than 50 years of activity in the service of peace andthe protection of human rights. We are moreoverconvinced that this noble mandate has today its ownraison d’être  and that it must be supported withdetermination  consistency and loyalty. We should alsohave the courage and humility to be able to give upsomething in the name of the higher interest of allcountries and all peoples who form part of theinternational community."
"151",6411,"STP",53,1998,"On behalf ofthe people and the Government of Sao Tome and Principe and on my own account  I congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session  and wish you success in carrying outyour duties.On the occasion of the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tomeand Principe would like to join with all other countries ofthe world in advocating the cause of development  peaceand liberty for all the world’s people. We want also to stateour deep concern at the grave problems which affectmankind and which pose a threat to the world.We are one year away from the beginning of a newmillennium  and it is with sadness that we observe aworld deeply divided between North and South  rich andpoor  and developed and underdeveloped countries.The African continent continues its process ofhealing and its struggle towards development. In recentdecades many countries of our continent have becomeindependent and democratic  and are ready for the openmarket. Some of them have experienced significanteconomic growth. Economic reforms and democracy havemade them favourable ground for development.However  against this background  many Africancountries have become poorer. Bad management andvarious types of crisis have given these countries veryfew opportunities for development. In 1996  240 millionAfricans were living on less than one dollar per day.Africa’s share of international trade was only 2 per cent and the continent received 2 per cent of foreigninvestment. Poverty is increasing  and political instabilityis creating violent conflicts which are very difficult tocontrol.With deep sadness  we observe too many armedconflicts  such as those in Sudan  Somalia  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Angola  the GreatLakes region  Guinea-Bissau  Eritrea and so on. Toomany lives have been lost; too much economicinfrastructure and too many homes have been destroyed;too many refugees have been created. That is the result ofarmed conflicts in our continent.This situation merits the attention of all in order toprevent armed conflicts  by creating an environment fordialogue and reconciliation based on democraticprinciples  good governance and respect for the humanrights of minorities.The situation in Guinea-Bissau requires the specialattention of the international community in order topromote dialogue between all the parties in conflict. Weparticipated in negotiations as a member of theCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries  togetherwith the Southern African Development Community  andour mediation resulted in a ceasefire. We appeal to bothparties to create a good environment to secure peace andtranquillity and restore the normal functioning ofdemocratic institutions and respect for the Constitution.19Angola is also our concern. We call on theinternational community to avoid another war in thatcountry. We also appeal to UNITA and to the Governmentof National Unity and Reconciliation  of which UNITA isa part  to fulfil all the objectives of the Lusaka Protocol andwork for peace and development.The situation in Central Africa and the Great Lakesregion is for us the most worrying in our continent. I do notwant to exaggerate  but I can say that this subregion is inflames which can spread into other countries. Our desire isto work together with the international community and allcountries in the subregion to seek a solution. Despite all theapproaches already made to end the conflict peacefully  wecannot remain inactive while the conflict is widening  withcatastrophic consequences. The international communitymust continue to work for peace to stop the suffering ofinnocent people.Besides the conflicts on the African continent  thereare others  such as that in East Timor. The East Timoresepeople have been suffering under foreign occupation. Theyare fighting for self-determination  the right to freely choosetheir own destiny  in accordance with the Charter of theUnited Nations. If we deny them those rights  we contradictthe principles of our Organization. Against this background we reaffirm our support for the Maubere people in theirstruggle for self-determination. We appeal to the UnitedNations and the international community to continuesupporting the negotiations to reach a peaceful end of theconflict.The world is facing serious environmental problems.The development of programmes to protect our planet mustbe a priority  and we must work together to avoidbehaviour that damages the environment by creatingpollution  land degradation and destruction in general. Weneed to follow the Rio Declaration if we want a safeenvironment and sound development. We have to payspecial attention to the problems of desertification  waterpollution  deforestation and biological diversity.I would like to call attention to resolution 2758(XXVI)  adopted in 1971  which denied over 21.8 millionpeople their right to international representation and totallycontravenes the principle of universality  consecrated in theCharter. The admission of the Republic of China on Taiwanas one of our own would not pose a challenge to any of theexisting Members  and the peaceful coexistence of the twosides in this Organization would be a catalyst to end one ofthe largest and most enduring sources of instability in Asia.Taking into consideration this and the changes that havetaken place in international relations  we call on theGeneral Assembly to review resolution 2758 (XXVI).Fifty-three years after the United Nations wasfounded  I would like once again to emphasize and praisethe positive contribution this Organization has made tofreedom  development and peace. The Organization facesmore and more challenges  and it is necessary andconvenient to proceed with reform of the system to makeit capable of responding to the demands upon it. Thereform must also include the Security Council; it is timeto reform its structure to provide a better geographicalrepresentation.It is our understanding that a more democratic efficient and less bureaucratic United Nations may bettershoulder its obligations and carry out its duties  in orderto guarantee progress and universal peace.The struggle against organized crime  drugs  moneylaundering and international terrorism must be one of thepriorities of the United Nations and of all countries.Everybody must contribute to fighting these problems andtheir catastrophic consequences.My country is facing a difficult moment in itshistory. The economy of Sao Tome and Principe has beenundergoing deep changes. Statistical data show that thereis a significant improvement. It seems that inflation hasslowed; there is an improvement in the fiscal system andthe value of the national currency has risen.The Government has been making efforts in order toachieve satisfactory results in the area of economicdevelopment and reducing poverty. One of our concernsis related to the problem of our high foreign debt estimated at nearly $270 million and which is 54 timesgreater than the value of our exports. Despite all theefforts that have been made  these numbers are still tragic.It is essential for Sao Tome and Principe to benefit fromhaving its foreign debt forgiven. It is very important forus to be able to participate in the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt (HIPC) Initiative.In closing  I would like to thank the United Nationsand its specialized agencies for the support given to mycountry."
"152",6450,"SUR",53,1998,"Before starting mystatement  I should like to express  on behalf of mydelegation  our sympathy to the victims and their familiesin the path of the destructive Hurricane Georges through thecountries of our region  including Caribbean sister nations.I call upon the United Nations and its humanitarianagencies to render all possible support to the countries andthe peoples afflicted.Allow me to extend my congratulations to you Mr. President  on your election to preside over ourGeneral Assembly at this session. I would also like toexpress my appreciation to Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko forhis important contribution during the last session.In addition  may I also thank the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his continuous efforts to transformour United Nations into a more effective instrument forpromoting peace and enhancing the well-being of thepeople of the world as we move into a new millennium.The restructuring of the Security Council with aview to properly reflecting the present internationaleconomic and political reality and to meeting the newchallenges of the next millennium is of fundamentalimportance. My delegation believes that the discussionsshould not be limited to the mere expansion of theCouncil  but should rather address the improvement of itseffectiveness and its adherence to the principle of ourCharter that all States are equal. We would like toemphasize that my delegation fully underscores theposition taken by the Non-Aligned Movement  mostrecently at its twelfth summit meeting in Durban  SouthAfrica.Suriname is pleased with the call by the Secretary-General for greater cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional organizations in preventing conflicts.In the western hemisphere  it is mainly the Organizationof American States and the Caribbean Community(CARICOM) which have often demonstrated theircapabilities of overcoming seemingly insurmountablehurdles by preventing or ending conflicts between andwithin member States.Allow me to raise some matters of equally seriousinternational concern that require urgent attention. Adisturbing and despicable phenomenon  which we all mustcondemn in the strongest terms  is the senseless attackson and even killing of international civil servants including United Nations field officers. Since these heroicmen and women are contributing to the cause ofhumanity  crimes committed against them must be treatedas crimes against humanity and punished accordingly.Recent terrorist attacks in Africa  Europe and elsewherehave once more shocked the international community andhave left us in a state of dismay.5The Republic of Suriname condemns internationalterrorism and welcomes the conclusion of regionalagreements and mutually agreed declarations to combat andeliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.My Government deeply deplores the fact that theprocess for durable peace and reconciliation in the MiddleEast has again been stalled and the current situationcontinues the great suffering of the Palestinian people anduncertainty for the people of Israel. We call upon all sidesto re-establish mutual confidence and call on theinternational community to exert every influence on theparties concerned to save the peace process.It is recognized that the phenomenon of globalizationpresents a challenge for the Caribbean region  and requiresfundamental changes in our economies and in thedevelopmental process of the region  while increasing therisk of marginalization for all vulnerable economies.In this regard  we share the view that the smallCaribbean States should be granted a reasonable period foradjustment to the changing international environment  inorder to enable us to improve our competitiveness  and anon-reciprocal preferential system must be maintainedduring that transition period. This will allow for a morerealistic transition  which will eventually facilitate betteradaptation of our economies.More than ever  the interdependence of States hasbecome clear  now that the negative consequences ofglobalization have recently manifested themselves in adramatic manner for many of our member States. Itherefore make an urgent appeal to all responsible actorsinvolved in the world economy  including the internationalfinancial institutions and monetary authorities  to adjusttheir relevant policies so as to redress the structural financial and economic imbalances and adverse effects thathave risen.We call upon all nuclear-weapon States to accede toand fully implement the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty. We are convinced that the new Department forDisarmament and Arms Regulation will bolster the capacityof the United Nations to pursue these objectives  bearing inmind the ruling by the International Court of Justice in July1996 that the use of  or the threat to use  nuclear weaponsis contrary to international humanitarian law.As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  Suriname wishesto reiterate its commitment to these rights. At the sametime  my Government holds the view that it is equallyimportant not to focus our attention solely on thefulfilment of civil and political rights; we should alsofocus on the fulfilment of the social and economic rightsof our peoples.It is in this respect that Suriname believes that theimplementation of the “Right of Development”  inparticular for peoples in the developing world  must begiven equal attention by the international community.What should be stressed in this context is that humanrights and sustainable human development areinterdependent and mutually reinforcing. The promotionof human rights is  indeed  of particular relevance in aglobalized world  with its potential to marginalize theweak and small States  particularly those with limitedresources.Suriname takes part in the General Assembly debatewith a sense of pride  since it has demonstrated to theworld its acceptance of responsibility for the protection ofthe environment by preserving one of the most pristineforests on this globe for conservation purposes. Mycountry has recently created the Central Suriname NatureReserve  comprising 1.6 million hectares and 12 per centof the territory of the Republic of Suriname. This naturereserve  one of the largest nature reserves in SouthAmerica and possibly the single most pristine tropicalarea on Earth  is our gift to humankind for eternity. Iconsider this gift a special contribution to  among otherthings  the safeguarding of one of the fundamental humanrights of the world population  namely  the right to life.We hope that other nations will follow this example andcommit themselves to the protection of the forests of ourworld.The information superhighway facilitates theexchange of information and can also contribute to thedevelopment and the promotion of public awarenessworldwide. However  I must also express my sincereconcern about the possible negative consequences of themisuse of this form of technology  which could haveadverse effects on all strata of our communities  includingour youth. It deserves serious consideration to developand implement legislative measures to prevent any formof misuse of this form of technology  without in anyrespect jeopardizing the fundamental right of freeexpression.As a result of the twentieth special session of theGeneral Assembly  devoted to the world drug problem 6Suriname is now in the final stage of organizing asubregional conference on the drug problem  the aim ofwhich is to establish a plan of action in cooperation withGuyana  Venezuela  Brazil and France  in order toeffectively combat this form of organized crime.Finally  I am pleased to conclude that since our lastAssembly reform of our Organization has been well on itsway  with a renewed emphasis on economic  social anddevelopment activities  and the need to implement itsmission of peace  development and human rights in a moreeffective manner.We must continue to revitalize the United Nations since it is our universal instrument for concerted action inthe pursuit of our noble aim of the betterment ofhumankind. It bears repeating  again and again  that themajority of the key conflicts in the world  and the threatsto the world community  can only be solved or avertedthrough the strengthening of our multilateral mechanism.The United Nations must be that mechanism. Ourcombined political will should be its new life; a new lifefor the challenges of the new millennium."
"153",6474,"SVK",53,1998,"First of all  I wish tocongratulate the President on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession and to express my sincere belief that under hisleadership this session of the General Assembly will carryout successfully the tasks that the international communityexpects this global forum to deal with.I would also like to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenkofor his work and contribution to the successful completionof the last session of the General Assembly.In this period of significant global political andeconomic changes  the world needs a modern andeffective United Nations that is capable of dealing withissues of importance to all of mankind in a proper andflexible manner. Slovakia believes that the ongoingprocess of reform of the United Nations will contributesubstantively to this goal. It gives its full support to theswift implementation of the reform measures initiated bythe Secretary-General in his basic report on reform.The Slovak Republic welcomes the proposal todesignate the fifty-fifth session of the General Assemblyas the Millennium Assembly. We expect that theMillennium Assembly will provide Member States anopportunity to formulate answers to questions about thestrategic goals of the United Nations for the nextmillennium in the field of international peace and securityand economic cooperation. We assume that the report onthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-first centurythat the Secretary-General intends to present to theGeneral Assembly in the year 2000 will provide athorough evaluation of the results achieved in specificareas of United Nations activities.The Slovak Republic supports a Security Councilreform that would enhance its representative character  itsworking methods and the transparency of its work  aswell as preserve the Council?s capability to act promptly.The reform should result in an adequate representation ofindividual regional groups and accommodate a legitimateclaim of the Eastern European regional Group and otherStates to a new non-permanent seat in the SecurityCouncil. Let us keep in mind that the number of membersof the Eastern European Group has doubled over the pastfew years.22Slovakia supports the efforts to reach a consensus onthe reform in the area of United Nations financing favouring the principle of capacity to pay. In any case much of the tension can be solved through the regularcontributions by Member States to the relevant UnitedNations budgets.The Slovak Republic supports the idea of theexclusively peaceful use of nuclear energy and is a strongadvocate of unconditional and universal observance of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).Slovakia actively participates in the Preparatory Committeefor the 2000 sixth Review Conference of the Parties to theNPT  and in this context fully supports the universality ofthe NPT and the CTBT. In March of this year  Slovakiacompleted the ratification process of the CTBT. Thisconfirms our active approach in this area.We appreciate the highly qualified and objectiveexpertise of the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA)  both in the field of elimination of the nuclearmilitary threat and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.Slovakia fully supported the activities of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency known as programme “93+2” forstrengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiencyof the safeguards system. I have the honour to inform theAssembly that the Board of Governors of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency approved at its session inSeptember the additional protocol to the safeguardsagreement between Slovakia and the International AtomicEnergy Agency. Early entry into force of the additionalprotocol will be a high priority for Slovak authorities.Slovakia pays very close attention to the issue oflandmines. The ratification of the Ottawa Convention is inthe internal legislative process. We believe that the Ottawaprocess and the Conference on Disarmament arecomplementary. Slovakia — which has experience indemining devices and technologies  and has capacities ineducation and training in mine clearance — would like toplay an active role in the process of the total elimination ofanti-personnel landmines.In the area of biological weapons  the Slovak Republicsupports improving the verification system of the BiologicalWeapons Convention  as well as the elimination of theillegal transfer of these weapons.Slovakia supports the efforts of the United Nationsaimed at conflict resolution through the strengthening ofUnited Nations capacities in the field of preventivediplomacy  early warning systems and effective use ofUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. Slovakia?s activeparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping operationsis proof of our continuing commitment. At present Slovakia is participating in three peacekeeping operations and it is prepared to provide troops to other missions aswell.My country supports the United Nations efforts tostrengthen its capacity for rapid deployment of UnitedNations peacekeeping forces  especially in furtherdeveloping the concept of United Nations stand-byarrangements  as well as a rapidly deployable missionheadquarters.In the process of post-conflict peace-building  it is ofthe utmost importance that a multifunctional approach inclose coordination with regional institutions and non-governmental and humanitarian organizations should bestrictly observed.One of the global problems that poses an everincreasing threat to humankind is terrorism. Slovakia hasalways rejected terrorism and strongly condemns all acts methods and practices of terrorism as criminal andunjustifiable  wherever and by whomsoever committed.The joint efforts of all States are a vital precondition forsuccessful fight against this evil.The year 1998 will witness two important humanrights anniversaries — the fiftieth anniversary of theadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsand the fifth anniversary of the World Conference onHuman Rights. Both these events represent an appropriateframework and provide the impetus for the furtherpromotion  protection and development of human rightsat the threshold of the twenty-first century.In a year which will mark two importantanniversaries in the field of human rights  theGovernment of the Slovak Republic approved thecountry?s accession to the Second Optional Protocol tothe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which I had the honour to sign on 22 September last.The Slovak Republic attaches great importance tointernational economic cooperation and to the importantrole of the Economic and Social Council in this process.In the framework of regional cooperation  Slovakiafavours respect for the specific needs of individualregions. We welcome  therefore  the activities of the23Economic Commission for Europe aimed at broadeningcooperation with the private business sector and non-governmental organizations. Slovakia is interested in a moreintensive participation in the development programmes ofthe United Nations specialized institutions and is preparingits own concept of development assistance  whose objectiveis to increase Slovakia?s participation in programmes fordeveloping countries.The Slovak Republic  as a member of the UnitedNations Environment Programme (UNEP) GoverningCouncil and the United Nations Commission on SustainableDevelopment  takes an active approach to issues ofenvironmental protection and sustainable development.In accordance with General Assembly resolution52/201  the Government of the Slovak Republic offered tohost the fourth meeting of the Conference of the Parties tothe Convention on Biological Diversity in Bratislava thisyear. In total 169 parties to the Convention took part in theConference under the presidency of the Minister of theEnvironment of the Slovak Republic. The successfuloutcome of the Conference reaffirmed the commitment ofall parties to conserve biological diversity for futuregenerations. The fact that the Government of the SlovakRepublic hosted that Conference confirms the importancewe attach to the protection of environment and sustainabledevelopment.As an emerging donor country  Slovakia isinvestigating ways of providing humanitarian assistance ona bilateral basis. A very important element in the process ofhumanitarian assistance  especially in crisis regions  isensuring the security of humanitarian personnel  and theSlovak Republic is ready to give its support to all UnitedNations measures aimed at reinforcing this security.The recent twentieth special session of the GeneralAssembly devoted to countering the world drug problemtogether was an important milestone in the joint efforts ofthe international community in the fight against drugs. It isa great achievement that for the first time in history aconsensus was reached between producer and consumercountries on the need to eliminate the threat of drugsthrough parallel and considered action in both priorityareas: decreasing the demand for drugs and decreasing theproduction of drugs.To coordinate drug control activities at the regionallevel  the Slovak Republic is ready to secure theestablishment in Bratislava of a regional United NationsInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) officefor the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.We appreciate that the Diplomatic Conference ofPlenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an InternationalCriminal Court in Rome was successfully completed  andwe believe that in the foreseeable future a permanentcriminal court will be established in order to punish themost serious crimes against humanity and  moreover  toprevent them.We believe that progress in the preparation of aninternational legal document on the elimination of nuclearterrorism will be achieved during this session of theGeneral Assembly. We also expect further substantialprogress in the discussion on the jurisdictional immunityof States and State property prepared by the InternationalLaw Commission.The United Nations contributes not only to theprogressive development of international law and itscodification but also — in particular through its mainjudicial authority  the International Court of Justice — tothe peaceful solution of disputes between States inaccordance with international law. The Slovak Republichas gained its first experience of ICJ proceedings. Itwelcomed the Court?s Judgment in the case concerningthe Gabcˇ'kovo-Nagymaros Project  which confirmed thevalidity of the treaty between Slovakia and Hungaryconcerning the construction and operation of the projecton the Danube. The Slovak Republic is sincerelyinterested in the implementation of the Judgment  whichwould be based on an agreement with Hungary reached if necessary  with the further help of the InternationalCourt of Justice.An active and effective participation of Slovakia inthe United Nations is one of our foreign policy priorities.To achieve this objective  Slovakia meets all itscommitments under the United Nations Charter in full andis consistently intensifying its engagement in all areas ofthe United Nations system. The candidature of the SlovakRepublic for a non-permanent seat in the Security Councilfor the term 2000-2001 is the logical result of thisapproach. I should like to stress that my country  whichbelongs to the group of small and medium-sized States is prepared to be fully responsible for bearing its fairshare of the global responsibility connected withmembership in the Security Council.As we approach the third millennium  a considerablepart of humankind is still facing poverty  violence 24violations of human rights and the effects of war. Themillions of people on this planet affected look to theinternational community  and the United Nations inparticular  with great hope. Whether we will succeed inreforming the United Nations together into a strong politically efficient and financially healthy system that willbe able to meet the expectations of current and futuregenerations depends on the will and commitment of all ofus."
"154",6499,"SVN",53,1998,"Let me take thisopportunity to congratulate the President and his country Uruguay  on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session. I am convinced that hisexperience and skills will help the General Assembly fulfilits important tasks.I would also like to thank Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko ofUkraine for his work as President and to commend him onhis decisive guidance during the deliberations of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly.The world order is being rearranged. Our time ismarked by continuous change. It is of crucial importancethat this process of change take place in a peaceful way andunder the rules which the international community hasagreed upon. The United Nations has an indispensable rolein that regard and must be able to respond to the world?sneeds. While it is true that the United Nations is aframework within which the Member States can pursuetheir own national interests  the United Nations is above allan instrument for making the common goals and aspirationsof humankind a realistic programme for a better future.The world and its goals and challenges are changing and the United Nations has to change as well. It was a wisedecision for the Member States to support the Secretary-General?s programme for reform and help him undertakethe necessary measures. We are glad to see that some ofthe steps of this excellent programme have already madethe United Nations more responsive and more effective.Only an efficient universal organization can help uscope with the pressing challenges of globalization economic and social development  environmental changesand the urgent need to protect and respect human rights.We need the United Nations to protect our highest andmost basic goal: the maintenance of international peaceand security. Therefore  we expect that the remainingproposals of the Secretary-General will be approved bythe Members during this session of the GeneralAssembly. This will allow us to move forward in thereform and transformation of our United Nations.Slovenia attaches special importance to thepromotion of the noble principles and values upon whichthe United Nations is built. This is why we wereespecially proud to be elected a non-permanent memberof the Security Council. The implementation of our keyforeign-policy objectives  which we pursue in our workand endeavours in the Security Council  is  however challenged by an increasing number of threats to peaceand stability. Judgement  compassion and determinationmust guide us in our struggle to offer new hope forsuffering people.From the Balkans to Central Africa and CentralAsia  a particular type of warfare seems to be prevailingin all conflicts. The civilian population is the main —and  very often  also the only — target. Violations ofhuman rights  international humanitarian law and the mosthorrible atrocities are becoming the usual consequences ofthese conflicts. These violations and their political rootcauses must be addressed by the international communityfrom the very start. We must act with unity anddetermination to ensure that violations of humanitarianlaw and human rights do not remain unpunished.There are actors in the international community whostill believe that the threat or use of force is a legitimatemeans of change. They consider political solutions andnegotiations only after and if military options fail. We cansee this in Africa  where new crises are succeeding theold ones. We can see it in the continued arms race  evenin the nuclear field. We can also see it in Europe  withKosovo offering yet another humanitarian tragedy. As ifall of this were not enough  we also face the lowest  themost unjustified violence of all — international terrorism which has harmed hundreds of innocent victims.6In Bosnia and Herzegovina the peace process is slowlybut definitely extending its roots. However  this process hasnot yet become irreversible. The international communitystill has an important role in leading the post-conflictmanagement of the situation. There is a growing need toensure economic reconstruction and provide adequateeconomic aid. Slovenia is actively participating in thoseefforts.Many important issues in Bosnia and Herzegovinaremain to be solved. The number of returning refugees especially among minorities  has been substantially lowerthan expected. In this regard  we commend the role of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization  its MultinationalSpecialized Unit and the international police transition forcefor their role. Democratization and reconciliation areindispensable elements in consolidating peace in Bosnia andHerzegovina. Reconciliation  however  does not meanimpunity. In fact  there will be no reconciliation until allwar criminals are brought to justice. To this end  we expectthe cooperation of all countries concerned.The situation in Kosovo has been giving rise tolegitimate international concerns for quite some time now.Serious violations of human rights have been reported foryears. In recent months the population of Kosovo has beensubjected to a campaign of terror and forced to flee theirhomes and seek refuge in the woods and mountains. Theinternational community should prevent humanitariancatastrophe this winter and force all the parties in theconflict to face their responsibilities. All forms of violenceagainst the civilian population in Kosovo must stop. TheKosovo population needs a ceasefire and needs negotiationsto start now. This is a prerequisite for the process of thereturn of refugees to start.The United Nations has the means to organize aneffective international action for the maintenance of peace.The Security Council is addressing most of these problems.At the moment  Slovenia is proud to be a non-permanentmember of the Security Council. We are doing our best tocontribute to the common effort to ensure that peace ismaintained  international obligations respected  justice doneand innocent lives saved wherever and whenever possible.Slovenian armed forces already participate in actionsto consolidate peace  security and stability. The conduct ofpeace-support operations is an expression of Slovenia?spolitical will and a reflection of the readiness of our armedforces.The wealth of experience the United Nations hasaccumulated is impressive. However  in many waysreform of its 50-year-old structure would greatly enhanceits effectiveness. Slovenia shares the view of the majorityof Member States that the Security Council also needs tobe and should be reformed. It should become morerepresentative and more up to date by expanding thenumber of its non-permanent as well as permanentmembers. It should become more effective in its decision-making. Last but not least  it should become moretransparent  for its decisions affect all the Member States.This year?s session of the General Assembly will bemarked significantly by the commemoration of animportant event  which continues to be an importantsource of inspiration for United Nations activities today.Fifty years have passed since the adoption of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  a historicdocument that recognized the inherent dignity and equaland inalienable rights of all members of the human familyas the foundation of freedom  justice and peace in theworld.This is an appropriate time to reflect on what hasalready been achieved and what still remains to be donein the field of human rights. This is the time to reconfirmour commitment and show our determination to promoteand protect the whole spectrum of human rights — civiland political  as well as economic  social and cultural.We believe strongly that the promotion andprotection of human rights is a legitimate concern of theinternational community and calls for a high level ofinternational attention and cooperation. Slovenia stronglysupports the work of the International Criminal Tribunalsfor the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda and is pleasedto see the first ever verdict on the crime of genocidehanded down by an international criminal court. We alsosee this as the most gratifying way to mark the fiftiethanniversary of the Convention on the Prevention andPunishment of the Crime of Genocide.The successful completion of the United NationsDiplomatic Conference on the establishment of anInternational Criminal Court on 17 July of this year is ahistoric step towards making the rule of law and humanrights truly universal. We hope that this will help providejustice for victims  limit impunity and deter acts ofgenocide  crimes against humanity and war crimes in thenext century.7The signing of the Ottawa Convention was animportant step forward towards the total ban of anti-personnel landmines. We all have to start a global processof demining and mine clearance operations in thousands ofmined areas all over the world. At the same time  theprocess of the physical and mental rehabilitation of millionsof mine victims throughout the world should start as soonas possible. Slovenia has already joined this process. TheGovernment of the Republic of Slovenia established theInternational Trust Fund for Demining and Mine VictimsAssistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The main purposeof the Fund is to raise financial resources and organizedemining operations and a programme of rehabilitation formine victims from Bosnia and Herzegovina. I would like totake this opportunity to invite other countries to join us inthis noble effort.At the end of the cold war  many countries anticipatedthe end of the nuclear era. We were expecting anaccelerated process of elimination of nuclear weapons.Unfortunately  and notwithstanding important successes inthe reduction of nuclear arms  the proliferation of nuclearweapons has increased in recent years. Slovenia stronglydeplores nuclear tests and appeals to all countries to endtheir military nuclear programmes.Slovenia demonstrated its determination to contributeto nuclear disarmament by joining seven other non-nuclearcountries — Brazil  Egypt  Ireland  Mexico  New Zealand South Africa  and Sweden — in launching the jointdeclaration of eight Ministers for Foreign Affairs entitled“Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a newagenda” [A/53/138]. The prime goal of our action was tostart new efforts for nuclear non-proliferation and nucleardisarmament. We  the representatives of eight countries  arefirm in our efforts to enable forthcoming generations toenjoy a world free of nuclear weapons.This is the time for concrete action and visionaryinitiatives. The evolution of the international systemrequires both. Slovenia is aware of this important need. Webelieve that such basic issues of international security as theissue of nuclear arms need to be addressed in a realistic andcomprehensive manner."
"155",6544,"SWE",53,1998,"Let me first of all through you  Sir  congratulate the President of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly upon his election. Iam confident that our important work will be guided in amost productive way. I would also like to thank the formerPresident  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for his relentless workand creativity to bring about consensus on the Secretary-General?s important reform proposals for the UnitedNations.Before proceeding to my statement  I would like toreport that this afternoon an important resolution on thesituation in Kosovo was adopted by the Security Council.The resolution is a firm response to a stark reality. TheCouncil spells out what Belgrade must do now towardsachieving a political situation and to avoid a humanitariandisaster. Their deeds and not their words will determinefurther Security Council action. Also  the Kosovo Albaniansmust act in accordance with the demands in theresolution. As a Council member  and now as itsPresident  Sweden has worked persistently for such aclear message to be sent by the Security Council. I trustthat it will be heard and understood.Sweden aligns itself with the statement madeyesterday by my Austrian colleague  Mr. WolfgangSchüssel  on behalf of the European Union.Economic turbulence  persistent poverty andenvironmental degradation provide a sombre backgroundto this session of the General Assembly. So do crises andconflicts  terrorism and nuclear test explosions and  ofcourse  the political and financial realities affecting theUnited Nations itself.We receive early warning signals  but early actionrarely follows. Isolationism and unilateralism could easilyre-emerge.Many are concerned about the difficulties they facein meeting the requirements of a globalized internationalcommunity. The positive aspects of globalization —integration and economic progress — offer the bestopportunities we have ever known for achieving peace democracy and development. When trade  economies andfinancial markets do not recognize any borders  politicsmust be global as well.The United Nations has to continue to reform inorder to remain relevant. The Swedish Government standsfirmly behind the reform efforts of the Secretary-Generalto streamline the Organization  to focus more on its coreactivities and to introduce a stringent and up-to-datemanagement culture.Member States cannot shy away from theirresponsibility for the Organization. United Nations reformis not a cost-cutting exercise  but one of rendering theOrganization more effective. It cannot be reformed underthe threat of political and financial crisis. No MemberState has the right to set conditions for fulfilling Charterobligations. All debtors must pay their assessedcontribution in full  on time and without conditions.I will speak today of five key areas for globalresponse  international cooperation and common action.First  we must strengthen cooperation to eradicatepoverty. Poverty is not only lack of material resources. Itis also lack of knowledge and influence over one?s own32life. It is a question of justice. The principle at stake is thatof equal rights and opportunities for all. A prerequisite forsuccess in the fight against poverty is that the poorthemselves are involved in a partnership based on commonethics and mutual trust.Democracy  development and peace are closely linked.Empty stomachs do not provide a sustainable ground fordemocracy. Individual human security and the security ofthe planet must be given as much recognition as thesecurity of States.Putting an end to poverty is imperative. Largeeconomic inequalities and lack of civic infrastructure createfriction between individuals  between groups  betweencountries. Marginalization spurs violent conflicts. Securitycannot be seen primarily in a military perspective.Development and economic integration play a much greaterrole in preventing serious conflicts.In an increasingly globalized world the fight againstpoverty is a common interest and a common duty. Only onthe basis of solidarity can we create a world which respectsthe equal rights and value of all its people. It will requirenot only efforts by poor countries  but also by richercountries.Therefore  I regret that only four countries meet theUnited Nations aid target of 0.7 per cent of gross nationalincome. Sweden is proud to be one of them. The sevenlargest economies on average contribute only 0.19 per cent.Free trade still remains to be fully achieved.Remaining barriers which prohibit poor countries frommaking use of their comparative advantages are counter-productive and must be abolished. The trade policies ofindustrial countries should also facilitate regionalcooperation among developing countries.The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiativemust be strengthened  as the debt crisis creates viciouscircles for weak economies. The international financialsystem has proved to be insufficiently adapted to politicaland social realities.Secondly  we must strengthen cooperation to promotehuman rights. Societies which respect human rights aremore stable and more peaceful. Repression spurs rebellion violence breeds violence.This year we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It has givenhope to people all over the world. It has inspired humanrights advocates to expose violations in their owncountries. It has encouraged Governments to take actionto protect and monitor respect for human rights. Butmuch remains to be done.Primitive expressions of public vengeance have noplace in a civilized legal system. Today  a majority of theMember States have abolished the death penalty or placedit under a moratorium. This is sometimes done inresponse to public opinion  but also frequently as a resultof political leadership and with the support ofinternational norms and standards.Economic  social and cultural rights create the basisfor a sustainable society with strong democraticparticipation. The exploitation of children drasticallyillustrates the importance of these rights. A convention onchild labour should be agreed at the next internationallabour conference  and urgent national and internationalmeasures should be taken to combat the most disgustingform of exploitation — child prostitution.The use of child soldiers is another fundamental andincreasingly frequent violation of the rights of the child.It is vital to achieve international standards againstinvolving children under 18 as combatants and tocombine this with practical and preventive measures tohelp and protect children in need.The rights laid down in the Universal Declarationapply to all. Special norms for vulnerable groups arenecessary to ensure that they can be equal with others.The principle of non-discrimination is of particular andcritical importance for individuals who belong to ethnic linguistic or religious minorities or to indigenous peoples.This principle should be complemented with nationalmechanisms to ensure effective participation in society.Few measures would be more important to preventconflicts within and among States.The adoption of the Rome Statute for theInternational Criminal Court is a milestone in the struggleagainst genocide  crimes against humanity and warcrimes. Sweden will become a party  and I urge all Statesto do the same. It is imperative to close the gap ofimpunity.Thirdly  we must strengthen cooperation to deependemocracy. The United Nations should increasinglybecome a leader in worldwide efforts to strengthen anddeepen democracy. It is essential to develop civil  open33and pluralistic societies; to promote equal participation ofall women and men in political life; and to ensureindependent media  freedom of speech and the rule of law.I suggest that the time has come to look systematicallyat how the United Nations system as a whole can be evenmore effectively put to use to promote democracy.Already in 1795 Immanuel Kant stressed the strongconnection between peace and democracy:“If the consent of the citizenry is required in order todetermine whether or not there will be a war  it isnatural that they consider all its calamities beforecommitting themselves to so risky a game.”(Perpetual Peace)Democracies seek security in cooperation with oneanother rather than through deterrence — in openness ratherthan in secrecy. Democracies also have a proven record indealing with internal tension and strife without resorting toviolence.Strengthening democracy helps prevent violentconflict  by allowing for differing views and interests. Ademocratic culture provides the ground for reconciliation.The common values inherent in democracy alsoprovide fertile ground for peaceful cooperation to buildsociety. The free exchange of ideas  people and goodscreates interdependence and common norms. The futurebecomes a shared opportunity.This is illustrated by developments during the lastdecade in Sweden?s own neighbourhood  the Baltic region.For half a century  the Baltic was a deep trench separatingEast and West. The same sea today unifies free countries inblossoming trade  political cooperation and people-to-peoplecontacts.Fourthly  we must strengthen cooperation to bringabout disarmament. In May this year  two States — Indiaand Pakistan — exposed their nuclear ambitions byconducting a series of test explosions. These aspirationsendanger international peace and security  as well asstability in the region and international non-proliferationand disarmament efforts. This was why Sweden and Japantook the initiative to prepare a Security Council resolutiondeploring the testing. After a decade of great promise in thefield of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament  thespectre of nuclear weapons is again at the centre ofattention.The possession of nuclear weapons — by anyState — cannot be indefinitely accepted as legitimate. On9 June  I and my colleagues from Brazil  Egypt  Ireland Mexico  New Zealand  Slovenia and South Africa madea joint ministerial declaration on nuclear weapons. In thedeclaration  we urge the five nuclear-weapon States andthe three nuclear-weapon-capable States to clearly committhemselves to eliminating their nuclear weapons andnuclear capability and to start work immediately onpractical steps to this end. We also set out a series ofmutually reinforcing measures providing a road map to aworld free from nuclear weapons.At this session of the General Assembly  the eightnations will follow up the declaration with a draftresolution. This initiative has already been presented fromthis rostrum. We invite all Member States to join us insupporting this draft resolution and  inter alia  call for theaccession by all States to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  the entry into force of STARTII and negotiations on START III  the prompt de-alertingof nuclear weapons and the withdrawal of non-strategicnuclear weapons.New and forceful impetus is urgently needed toregain the momentum for nuclear disarmament. It isnecessary to counteract the tendency to assign newimportance to nuclear weapons. These weapons mustneither be given increased emphasis in defence planningnor be seen as a means to counter threats from otherweapons of mass destruction.The world needs a new international agenda forcomplete nuclear disarmament. We must at the same timeredouble our efforts to rid the world of all biological andchemical weapons.The threat of terrorist use of weapons of massdestruction adds to the urgency of disarmament efforts.Strict adherence to international agreements  strengthenedverification and controlled weapons destruction areessential parts of a long-term strategy against terrorism.International control regimes to limit the transfer oftechnology that could be used to produce weapons ofmass destruction as well as other armaments must befurther developed.The proliferation of small arms and light weapons isa serious threat to peace  security and development. Such34weapons have been the primary cause of casualties inalmost every recent conflict on the United Nations agenda.Practical and concrete measures — such as collection safe storage and destruction in the context of peacekeepingoperations — should be the focus in dealing with smallarms and light weapons. Therefore  the SwedishGovernment supports the Mali initiative for a West Africanmoratorium on the production and transfer of suchweapons.I warmly welcome the forthcoming entry into force ofthe Ottawa Convention. This is a major step in the struggleagainst the plague of anti-personnel landmines. Concertedefforts will be needed to ensure its full implementation aswell as the adherence of the largest military Powers.Fifthly  we must strengthen cooperation to preventarmed conflict. Stable peace does not suddenly turn intomilitary conflict. War normally breaks out after a period ofgradual deterioration. Prevention has the best prospects ofsuccess at the earliest possible stage of such a process.The need for early action is obvious. Nevertheless decisions are taken at a late stage — often too late. Thereare strong forces at work which obstruct early action —forces hiding behind arguments about sovereignty  publicopinion and national interest; forces defining security asstability and order  rather than dealing with the underlyingcauses of conflicts.After almost two years on the Security Council we aremore convinced than ever of the urgent need to buildpolitical commitment for preventive measures and todevelop  hone and refine preventive instruments. It is aquestion of political will. It is a matter of allocatingresources. It is about looking for solutions that aresustainable over the long term  even when strong forceswant to focus on short-term needs alone.National responsibility for conflict prevention isfundamental. International law makes every Stateresponsible for its international behaviour. States shouldalso be expected to account for their internal actions  whichoften have major external consequences. Sovereignty shouldstand for responsibility and accountability.Conflict prevention is also an internationalresponsibility. The United Nations possesses a wide arrayof instruments for preventive action. Lessons have alsobeen learned from a wide range of peacekeeping operations.A new generation of peacekeeping operations isemerging  often with a flexible mix of civilian  militaryand police components. International service is a key taskfor the Swedish armed forces  and increasingly also forthe Swedish police.To be effective  the United Nations — and  inparticular  the Security Council — must act promptly unitedly and in unison with regional actors. Severalregional organizations have identified conflict preventionand peaceful settlement of disputes as key tasks. Thegrowing network of European security organizations isone example  cooperation between African States another.Cooperation with regional actors is crucial butcomplex in today?s growing grey zone of conflicts —domestic in origin but international in impact. They ofteninvolve neighbouring countries as recipients of refugees as weapons suppliers or even as participants. In suchsituations  the United Nations must be faithful to itsglobal principles  but must also find a way of engagingregional actors in peaceful solutions that guarantee thelegitimate security interests of all.When regional leadership is available  the role of theUnited Nations should be one of providing support and when international military peace operations are needed authorizing and monitoring. When regional leadership islacking  the United Nations must be ready to lead.I have highlighted five key areas and objectives forthe United Nations: the eradication of poverty  thepromotion of human rights  the deepening of democracy the achievement of disarmament and the prevention ofarmed conflicts.Yet the uniqueness and strength of the UnitedNations lies not in any single field of activity  but in thetotality of them all. Peace  security  democracy  humanrights  social justice  humanitarian relief  sustainabledevelopment and prevention are inseparable.In a time of difficult political and financialchallenges for the Organization  it is important that wespell out our expectations and priorities. We will have towork hard to allow the United Nations to realize itspotential. We owe it to the United Nations — and to eachother — to give it the chance to succeed."
"156",6582,"SWZ",53,1998,"I come with the greetingsand warm wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III  HerMajesty the Indlovukazi  the Queen Mother  theGovernment and the whole Swazi nation to all our fellowmembers of the United Nations.On behalf of the Kingdom of Swaziland  I wouldlike to extend our warmest congratulations to Mr. Operttion his unanimous election to the presidency of the fifty-9third session of the General Assembly. We have the fullestconfidence in his ability to lead the deliberations of thissession  and I can assure him of my delegation?s fullsupport and cooperation.I would like to congratulate his predecessor Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  on the skill with which hepresided over the fifty-second session.I would also like to commend the work done over thepast 12 months by our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan and the staff of the United Nations Secretariat. We havebeen impressed by the strength of their commitment tomeet the many challenges facing our Organization  and wetake pride in their considerable achievements.The Kingdom of Swaziland is encouraged by theprogress that has been achieved in the reform of the UnitedNations. Much credit is due to the Secretary-General andhis staff for their implementation of cost-cutting measuresand the commitment they have shown to creating a moreefficient Organization.For our part  we believe the membership must providethe financial resources for the Organization to carry out thetasks that we ourselves have set. We surely cannot expectthe United Nations to meet its existing obligations  let alonetake on the new challenges we present to it  if we lagbehind in the payment of our dues. The Kingdom ofSwaziland makes every effort to keep up to date with itsfinancial obligations in full  on time and withoutconditions — and we appeal to all our fellow MemberStates to do the same.The Kingdom of Swaziland is nevertheless concernedat the painfully slow rate of progress in the debate on therestructuring of the Security Council. The delay isespecially frustrating when we know that there is globalconsensus on the need to make the permanent membershipof the Council more democratic and representative of thedeveloping world. This issue has been central to discussionsduring Non-Aligned Movement summit meetings andsuccessive meetings of the Organization of African Unity(OAU). There continues to be unanimous support forchange.In this regard  the Kingdom of Swaziland continues tosupport the African common position  which calls  amongother things  for membership of the Security Council to bebased on an equitable geographical formula. Africa iscalling for two permanent seats  with the full voting andveto rights that are enjoyed by the current membership.However  in the longer term  we believe that the right ofveto should be the subject of review  as it is not inaccordance with recognized democratic practices since itgives unequal weight to the minority view.As we celebrate the thirtieth year of ourindependence and the thirtieth birthday of our monarch the Kingdom of Swaziland is continuing quietly andpeacefully to develop all aspects of life according to thewishes and expectations of our people. Our overall aim isto raise the living standards of all our people and toensure that access to all the basic requirements of decenthuman life is available to all. We have conducted anumber of initiatives aimed at identifying the areas ofhighest priority for action and we have asked the peoplethemselves to contribute their ideas and views on how wecan overcome the challenges we face. We have alwaysbelieved that sustainable development will be bestachieved in our country when there is the involvement support and understanding of the whole nation. It is forthis reason that we continue to consult the people onissues of national importance at open forums  thus givingall Swazis the opportunity to make their views known andhave them considered.The implementation of our development aimsinvolves a twin-track approach  with an economic andsocial reform agenda covering the shorter term  and anational development strategy to provide an action planfor the next 25 years. Both are the result of therecommendations of the Swazi people themselves andreflect the wishes of all Swazis.In a similar vein  and again in response to thepeople?s request  we are conducting a review of ourConstitution. His Majesty informed the General Assemblylast year of the establishment of the ConstitutionalReview Commission. The whole nation is engaged in thisvitally important exercise  and I am pleased to inform ourfellow Members that substantial progress has been madeover the past 12 months. The end result will truly reflectthe will of the people themselves  and we are confidentthat we will have in place a Constitution that will servethe best interests of all Swazis for many generations tocome.We have been most grateful for the support we havereceived from the United Nations towards these importantnation-building processes  and we value highly thecontinued support and encouragement from many of ourfriends and partners in the international community withrespect to our development efforts.10In common with almost every country  we find thatthe issue of unemployment remains our greatest challenge.We recognize that  with the global economic situationdeteriorating and the gap between the developed and thedeveloping countries widening  the task of creating jobs isbecoming more and more difficult. In response to this  wehave introduced incentives to attract investment from bothinternal and external sources  and we have established aninvestment promotion authority to act as the catalyst forrapid investment growth. Such national initiatives are aimedat creating favourable conditions for our people to gain adecent standard of living and to continue to enjoy the peaceand stability with which we have been blessed throughoutour history.We have noted with regret that the past 12 monthshave seen an alarming rise in situations of internal conflictand external aggression among many of the Member States.Furthermore  there are many instances of situations whereinternal conflicts have spilled over borders  creating thepotential for regional instability. The situations in theKosovo region of Yugoslavia  and the heightened tensionon the border between Iran and Afghanistan  are just twoexamples which are of great concern to the internationalcommunity.This worrying trend has resulted in valuable globalresources being channelled away from economic and socialdevelopment priorities  and has undermined our collectiveefforts to achieve peace and stability throughout the world.All too many of our fellow human beings are caughtup in a spiral of seemingly unending violence  with millionsforced into exile from their own homes  thus becoming thelatest statistics among the unfortunate numbers of refugees.In this respect  we urge the international community tocontinue to improve its response mechanisms so thatappropriate action is taken quickly and decisively to preventconflict and to repair the misery caused by it.In a similar vein  the stalling of the peace process inthe Middle East continues to frustrate the efforts of thosewho desire a genuine  lasting peace in that troubled region.The Kingdom of Swaziland applauds those nations whichare working hard to get the process back on track  and wecontinue to urge those involved to respect the terms of theOslo peace accord as the only basis on which to rebuild theatmosphere of trust which is so necessary for the process tomove forward.Meanwhile  on our continent of Africa  the conflicts inareas including the Horn of Africa and in countries such asthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  Angola  Lesothoand Guinea-Bissau  are challenging to the full thediplomatic skills of all of us in the internationalcommunity who hope to bring lasting peace to ourcontinent.Of particular concern to us in the southern Africanregion has been the renewal of civil war in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  the resumption ofhostilities in Angola and the very recent disturbances inLesotho. Our fellow members will recall the efforts of theSouthern African Development Community (SADC) among others  to find a solution to the distressingsituations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo andAngola  which are hampering cooperation betweenmember States of the community. In the case of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  the Kingdom ofSwaziland believes that the United Nations has a role toplay as peacemaker to complement the efforts of SADCand the OAU.In all cases  we pray that a solution may be found toend the bloodshed  establish a lasting ceasefire and allownegotiations between the opposing sides. We pray thatsustainable solutions may soon be found to all of Africa?sconflict situations and that all our fellow Africans may befree from the sufferings endured by so many for so long.The Kingdom of Swaziland applauds the remarkableprogress made towards a lasting settlement in NorthernIreland. We know there is still a long way to go  but given the centuries-long history of the Troubles  theachievement has been all the more impressive. We alsocommend those who have contributed to the process  andwe salute especially the people of Northern Ireland  whochose to take their destiny in their own hands and votedfor peace. This provides an excellent example of what ispossible when there is true commitment to peace from allsides in a dispute.Our continent?s fresh crises have shown once morethat Africa needs to be better prepared to head offpotential conflicts through timely dialogue andnegotiation  and to have available a pool of peacekeepersto act where necessary.The Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes the Secretary-General?s report to the Security Council regarding thecauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace andsustainable development in Africa.11In this regard  we support the concept of an integratedapproach to conflict resolution on our continent as a way ofenhancing closer cooperation between Africa and the rest ofthe world and making the best use of the resources at ourdisposal.The Kingdom of Swaziland is already engaged inefforts to become more involved in conflict resolution. Tothis end  we have welcomed the support of the UnitedKingdom and of the United States of America towards thepreparation of our defence force for participation inpeacekeeping operations in Africa and around the world.Of particular concern has been the evidence in the pastyear of the spread of weapons of mass destruction  andtheir use as instruments of aggression and intimidation. Wein the Kingdom of Swaziland reaffirm the view of the Non-Aligned Movement that there can be no moral justificationfor the ownership  manufacture or use of such weapons.We join the majority of States Members of the UnitedNations in calling for real commitment by all countries toglobal disarmament and to the creation of a world that willbe free and safe for future generations. In this respect  weurge all nations that have not done so to become parties tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT).It may be said that the crises we have mentioned sofar have been the result of man?s worst qualities andtherefore unnecessary and avoidable. The same is not trueof the many natural disasters that have struck hard atnations across the globe  irrespective of development status.The “El Niño” phenomenon has resulted in a series ofnatural disasters  the latest example being widespreadflooding throughout the Americas  Asia  Africa and parts ofEurope. Meanwhile  ironically  we in southern Africa mustwait once more to see if we will receive sufficient rain forour crops this year.The establishment by the United Nations of the Officeof Humanitarian Affairs could not have come at a moreopportune time  and the Kingdom of Swaziland gives itsfull support for its operations. We hope that its role willinclude assistance to Member States to develop emergencyrelief mechanisms so that we may all be better prepared tocope with disasters of all kinds in the future.The Secretary-General recently gave warning of thedeteriorating global economic situation and the wideninggap between rich and poor nations. The crisis in Asia hashad a devastating effect on the people of that region  andnow all the indications are that the economies of the restof the world will also be adversely affected. The twocertainties are that the worst is yet to come  and that itwill be the developing world that will be hardest hit.In this interdependent world of ours  the Kingdom ofSwaziland recognizes the importance of the concept ofpartnership between nations. We agree that no nation canafford to remain isolated and that there is an obligation —and an economic necessity — for the more developedcountries to support and assist those of us in thedeveloping world.We believe that the underlying principle of anypartnership should be one of mutual respect andunderstanding of each partner?s views  beliefs andposition. We look forward to working with our partnersin areas that our people have chosen as their developmentpriorities  in an atmosphere of trust and openness  andfree from the imposition of conditions that can impactnegatively on our capacity to improve.The process of globalization is now well advanced.The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that a good dealmore time and preparation are needed before we in thedeveloping world are ready to cope with the additionalresponsibilities that globalization will bring.The United Nations provides the ideal forum fordiscussion of these matters; let us make full use of ourOrganization  in an atmosphere of true respect betweenpartners  so that the positions of all may be understoodand appreciated.As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of theadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the Kingdom of Swaziland appreciates the efforts of theUnited Nations to integrate human rights issues into all itspolicies and programmes.The Kingdom of Swaziland has taken and continuesto take seriously its obligations to its people on humanrights issues. Furthermore  we support all initiatives aimedat improving the status of women  youth and children.They have a vital role to play in the development of anation in all aspects of life. The ongoing constitutionalreview is  inter alia  promoting the debate on humanrights issues.It is unfortunate to note that  even as we celebrate 50years of existence of the Universal Declaration of Human12Rights  there is one nation of 21.8 million people that webelieve is denied the right of membership of the UnitedNations. I am referring to the question of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan.The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to raise thisissue because of our conviction that the United NationsCharter provides for the representation of all nations of theworld. Furthermore  the Republic of China on Taiwan hasshown very clearly that it is a nation with the willingnessand capacity to play a prominent and responsible role inglobal development affairs  and yet it remains excludedfrom the activities of the one truly global developmentorganization.The principle of universality  as contained in ourfounding Charter  provides that all citizens of the worldhave the right to be heard in these chambers  and yet it isa fact that as I speak the people of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan are not represented here and therefore cannotcontribute their resources and expertise for the benefit ofthe international community through the medium of theUnited Nations.The Republic of China on Taiwan has shown itself tobe a peace-loving nation  with a high level of political economic and social development. It has an excellent recordof supporting development activities throughout the world.The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the time has nowcome to restore its rightful membership of the UnitedNations to the Republic of China on Taiwan. We join therest of our fellow members in proposing a review of thisissue  with full regard for the change in circumstances sincethe decision was taken in 1971 which led to the expulsionof the Republic of China on Taiwan from our Organization.The problem of drug abuse and trafficking is arelatively new phenomenon among the people of Swaziland but it is fast becoming a major threat to the development ofour country  particularly among our youth  who seem to bethe easiest target.The Kingdom of Swaziland welcomed the specialsession of the General Assembly on drugs  held in June thisyear  as a timely and necessary initiative. We thereforehave high expectations of the recommendations thatemerged from the special session  and we commit ourselvesfully to their implementation. We recognize  though  thatthe drug trade is cross-border and international in nature and we are working closely with our neighbours andregional partners to share ideas and resources in acombined effort to prevent the spread of the drug trade.The Kingdom of Swaziland condemns internationalterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We believethere can be no justification for the type of outrage thatwas witnessed recently in Nairobi  Kenya; Dar-es-Salaam Tanzania; and Cape Town  South Africa. The deaths of somany innocent people can surely bring no credit to —and win no support for — those who planned andcommitted the deeds. Our prayers are offered again forthe victims and their families and to all whose lives havebeen affected by the evils of terrorism. We support allmoves to bring the perpetrators to justice and to preventthe spread of the use of terrorism tactics.In this regard  the Kingdom of Swaziland welcomesthe establishment of the International Criminal Courtfollowing the Rome Conference. We believe it to be welltimed and justified  and we are of the view that theinternational nature of terrorism and drug-trafficking makeit essential that they be included as crimes that will fallunder the jurisdiction of the Court. We are confident thatthe General Assembly will give urgent priority to theestablishment of the Preparatory Commission so that theCourt itself will become operational in the shortestpossible time.The United Nations remains the only global forumin which the world can have any hope of achieving thegoals we all strive for. Peace and stability among allnations  promotion of sustainable development for all  andthe hope of future prosperity and security for all ourpeoples: these are the wishes and expectations of thosewe represent here.Our peoples look to this Organization to create theright conditions for these things to be possible. We cannotlet them down. I give my assurance that the Kingdom ofSwaziland will work hard to support the Secretary-General and his staff in their efforts to improve theefficiency and effectiveness of the United Nationsoperations. We are deeply grateful for the assistancegiven by the United Nations in support of the initiativeswe are undertaking in our country.Finally  on behalf of His Majesty the King  HerMajesty the Indlovukazi  the Queen Mother  theGovernment and the whole Swazi nation  I am proud totake this opportunity to reaffirm the Kingdom?scommitment to the ideals and aims of the Charter of theUnited Nations."
"157",6615,"SYC",53,1998,"eychelles is pleased to seeMr. Opertti at the helm of this session of the GeneralAssembly. We welcome the experience  expertise and skillswhich he brings to our deliberations. Likewise  we wish toexpress our appreciation to his predecessor for hisoutstanding contribution and leadership during the fiftysecond session.Our felicitations also go to the Secretary-General forspearheading courageous and innovative reforms aimed atrevitalizing the United Nations at the threshold of the newmillennium.We support the measures being undertaken to makethe United Nations more efficient and effective  capableof making optimal use of its resources. My delegationbelieves that development ought to be central to therenewed United Nations agenda. For this reason  we holdthat a larger proportion of United Nations resourcesshould be allocated to development  particularly to meetthe growing and imperious needs of the developingcountries. It is only in so doing that the objective ofattaining a “dividend for development” can be attained.Reform of the United Nations cannot be completewithout the reform of its main organ responsible for peaceand security: the Security Council. We are all agreed onthis  but we differ on how to go about it. Yet there is nodoubt that the Security Council should be transformedinto a democratic and representative organ  reflecting bothits universal character and present-day realities  andtaking into consideration the need for balancedrepresentation in its membership.Many options have been mooted. But there are stillmajor obstacles to overcome if we are to agree on thecomposition of the enlarged Council  the creation of newpermanent seats and the question of the veto right forboth current and prospective members. We need to moveand harmonize positions in order to arrive at a generallyacceptable solution. And in so doing we must reckon withthe fact that the developing countries of Africa  Asia andLatin America are and will be major stakeholders in theformulation of the international power structure of thetwenty-first century.Equally important for my delegation is that the reformpackage should encompass the enhancement of the GeneralAssembly as the supreme policy-making organ of theUnited Nations. It is only through the reinforcement of theAssembly’s role and mandate that we can successfullytackle some of the most pressing issues facing humanity not least the process of globalization. Globalization hasbrought prosperity to some. However  in this new globalvillage  many of its inhabitants — especially those in itsslums — face the prospect of further impoverishment andmarginalization. For them  the spectre of poverty  hunger malnutrition  inadequate shelter and disease is a constantreality. It is their daily lot. It flouts human dignity. No oneshould have to live and die in poverty. This is not how weenvisage the destiny of the greater part of humankind in thetwenty-first century.So the greatest challenge facing us  the UnitedNations  is the eradication of the slums of our globalvillage. If we want to get rid of the scourge of poverty  weneed to redress the present imbalances. We need to ensurethat all countries of the world benefit from the effects ofglobalization.Our basic contention — and I do not think that it istoo much to ask for — is that we should be able to increaseour share in the global economy  be it through trade orthrough the mobilization of foreign direct investment. Assmall developing economies  we face the enormouschallenge of building our export and institutional capacitiesto allow us to assume our place in this fiercely competitiveglobal environment.If we are to attract investments  improve productquality  meet standards — in short  compete effectively andgrasp the opportunities presented by the World TradeOrganization (WTO) agreements — then it is imperativethat the international community recognize the need to grantus adequate transitional support.It is in this context that my delegation appeals to theEuropean Union to accept the African  Caribbean andPacific group of States’ request for an extension of tradepreferences under a WTO waiver for a protracted period oftime  within the framework of the successor agreement tothe Lomé IV Convention. Genuine cooperation should takecognizance of the special development need of weaker andvulnerable partners to adjust to the demands ofcompetitiveness. We need time to allow a transitionalperiod of preparation and adjustment. And we need to doso under fair conditions.We small island developing States are the weakerand more vulnerable members of the internationalcommunity. It is a well-established fact. But whilstmomentum has been created for the recognition of ourspecial characteristics and constraints  it is somewhatdisappointing to note that avowed intentions have yet tobe translated into action. How are we to interpret thisapparent inertia in the application of the so-calledvulnerability index? How are we to interpret this apparentindifference to the problems we face  especially inrelation to security  sustainable development andenvironmental protection?Vulnerability has taught us in the Seychelles a fewlessons  though. Whilst our voice is little heard in thisforum  whenever we are asked about our role on theworld stage our response generally reveals an impressivescoresheet in such areas as conservation of theenvironment and an equally ambitious vision of our placein the world. We continue to work very hard to ensurethat the development necessary to give our people a highdegree of social well-being does not affect the “lastsanctuary on Earth”  as we call ourselves.“Environment” for us is not a fashion statement. Wedo not intend to give any lessons  but we certainly intendto be the conscience of the world. Whilst others  infinitelymore powerful and developed than we are  pollute andspoil  we preserve and protect. We have set aside some45 per cent of our national territory for the protection ofnature. And we have offered to the internationalcommunity two of its most precious natural treasures asWorld Heritage Sites.But all this has a cost. We bear the brunt of it conscious of our responsibility to future generations conscious that planet Earth is our common heritage. Ours though  is a shared responsibility  requiring globalsolutions to a global problem. And the solution is to befound not in rhetoric  but in action. Therefore  we expectthe industrialized nations to pay less lip service toenvironmental protection. We expect them to beaccountable and to meet their Kyoto commitments. Aboveall  we expect them to get their act together and clean upthe mess we are all in.Vulnerability has also taught us to live in racialharmony  to make ours the ideals for which the UnitedNations stands for. The force of our social cohesion liesin our racial diversity. Africans  Asians and Europeanshave forged our nation  resulting in a happy marriage ofraces that has led to an eclectic population of 79 0002people living in harmony and tolerance. When we see whatgoes on around us — wars  acts of wanton terrorism anddestruction  savagery and barbarism — all in the name ofsome insane ideology  religious  racial or political  we failto comprehend. We fail to understand  perhaps because wehave learned to live together as one nation  regardless ofracial origin or political or religious conviction.We try very hard to mitigate the effects of ourvulnerability. If we have achieved some degree of success it is through the prudent and often painstaking managementof our natural resources. It is also through the judicious useof international aid and grants that we have received overthe years. We have not wasted a cent of what has beenawarded to us. We have managed overseas developmentassistance by creating a beneficial multiplier effect that hastrickled down into all spheres and levels of our nationaldevelopment. Unfortunately  the logic and unwritten lawsof international cooperation will have it that we havebecome victims of this very prudent use of aid. We seemto have worked ourselves off the list of nations that qualifyfor such help.In this interdependent world of ours  the ramificationsof globalization have proved that the world order has nofrontiers. Solutions to the challenges of the newinternational order are to be sought through internationalsolidarity and cooperation  through the vehicle ofmultilateralism. This presupposes that every member of theinternational community should enjoy peace and security.Unfortunately  too many conflict situations persist  negatingeconomic growth and social progress. The African continenthas been disproportionately afflicted by intra-State andinter-State conflicts.At the special meeting of the Security Council onAfrica in April this year  we urged the internationalcommunity to put its full weight behind African peaceinitiatives  but also to reinforce the institutional andoperational capacity of the Organization of African Unity(OAU) in the prevention  management and resolution ofconflicts in Africa. Finding durable solutions to ourproblems in Africa requires a concerted and integratedapproach by the international community if we want tomake the African renaissance a reality in an era of globalsolidarity and partnership.Speaking of peace and security  we cannot butempathize with a fellow small island State — Cyprus —with which we are sentimentally bound in a commondestiny. The division of the island has persisted for toolong. We cannot allow it to continue as a fait accompli. Norcan we condone the presence of foreign troops there.Cyprus is a unitary  sovereign State whose intercommunalproblems can only be resolved on the basis of SecurityCouncil resolutions.In a separate but related context  we note with regretthe continuing tension in Greek-Turkish relations. Mycountry  like all peace-loving nations  would like to seeGreece and Turkey establish good-neighbourly relationsbased on international law and treaties  as well as on thebasis of the principles enshrined in the United NationsCharter. Differences are bound to remain  but these canbe resolved within mechanisms available in internationallaw  in particular  through the jurisdiction of theInternational Court of Justice. We urge Turkey to acceptthe Court’s jurisdiction.We are conscious of the inequalities and doublestandards which prevail throughout the world. The rulesof the game  more often than not  are not tipped in favourof the smallest among us. Indeed  relations betweennations give the lie to the statement that we are all equal.This is the reality of things. We do not say that wenecessarily accept the status quo. But we have learned tolive with it. Neither do we accept that squalor  injusticeand poverty should be the norms guiding relationsbetween human beings in the next millennium.So  in recognizing our own shortcomings andfailures  we also recognize that humankind is presentedwith a unique opportunity to right the wrongs andinjustices that it has perpetrated.We are also presented with a unique opportunity tomake our planet  our only home  a better  cleaner andsafer place to live. We can do so through a proactiveUnited Nations. It is not a perfect institution. But it is theonly institution which represents the collective conscienceof humanity. It represents the unique  indispensable forumfor shared international responsibilities and global issueswhich affect the entire community of nations.The United Nations remains our greatest hope forjustice  peace  security and development. It remains ouronly hope for a more compassionate world."
"158",6657,"SYR",53,1998,"I have the pleasure of congratulating you Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fifty-thirdsession of the General Assembly. We are confident thatyour wide-ranging expertise in international affairs willfacilitate your task and lead the deliberations of thissession to a successful conclusion. I should like also tothank your predecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for hiswise leadership and invaluable contributions during thepreceding session of the Assembly. Nor can I fail toexpress our thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Kofi Annan  for theefforts he is exerting to enhance the role of the UnitedNations in international affairs.Following the end of the cold war a decade ago many  especially in the countries of the North  believedthat this planet  which is home to approximately 6 billionpeople  was going to become a more stable  secure andprosperous world. That conviction proceeded from thenotion that the bi-polar system was unable to achieveinternational security except in the framework of abalance of terror. Nor was the old system able to resolveregional conflicts due to competition for areas ofinfluence.The question now before the internationalcommunity is the following: were these convictionsjustified? Or did wishful thinking leapfrog reality ignoring the following salient facts?First  nuclear weapons  which are unparalleled intheir destructive capability  have proliferated since the endof the cold war and have now reached India and Pakistan.This proliferation has also gained a sort of legitimacybased on the fact that Israel?s possession of nuclearweapons was not spoken of during the 1995 Review andExtension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. My country Syria  Arab countries and most countries in the Non-Aligned Movement appealed to the five nuclear-weaponStates during the review and extension conferences forthis Treaty not to exempt any country from adhering tothis Treaty  so that the world will not face a new nucleararms race. Unfortunately that urgent call fell on deaf ears.Those who now assume that nuclear-arms proliferationwill be limited to a few countries are mistaken. Syria and10all Arab countries call for turning the Middle East into anuclear-weapon-free zone  as a serious contribution tohalting the nuclear-arms race.Secondly  in the post-cold-war era regional conflictshave multiplied  becoming more fierce  and with varyingforms and motives. This has happened to such an extentthat the United States  which is now the only super-Powerin a unipolar world  and the Security Council  the bodyresponsible for maintaining international peace and security are no longer able to contain these conflicts  let alone findjust solutions to them. Anyone who reads the statementissued by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the fivepermanent members of the Security Council  issued at thebeginning of this session of the General Assembly  willhave a headache and will be severely frustrated at seeingthis world face so many regional conflicts and so manycomplicated crises without any light at the end of thetunnel.Thirdly  we have the recent economic and financialcrises in the world  particularly following the collapse offinancial markets in South-East Asia and the accompanyingsharp decline in the prices of raw materials  especially oil.All of this has proven that economic globalization is a two-edged sword and has repercussions which cannot beconfined to those countries tantalized by rapid prosperitygenerated by an inflow of capital and foreign investments.Rather  such effects go beyond those countries to thecountries exporting capital and investments  which werealso tempted by quick profits without paying much heed tothe consequences.What is going on in the world now under the bannerof globalization is a cause for concern  because it givespriority to profit over other development factors: economic social  cultural and environmental. It also strives to confinethe role of the State to providing guarantees and protectionto major market forces  ignoring the responsibility for theachievement of social justice for the peoples. Furthermore the continuing marginalization of developing countries ininternational economic decision-making and the continuingsevere restrictions on access by such countries tointernational markets and financial and technologicalresources render these countries unable to benefit from thepromised opportunities of globalization.Strengthening development indicators and increasinglevels of productivity are the more durable means oflimiting the effects of economic crises and reducing theeffects of financial upheavals  especially in developingcountries. At any rate  we believe that such crises andshake-ups may happen from time to time and may touchevery country  no matter how immune it may seem  solong as the most powerful and prevalent monetary unit inthe world — the United States dollar — is not stable.However  the imminent issuance of a European monetaryunit may contribute to establishing a more stableinternational financial and economic system.In any case  we believe there is no alternative toopening a serious dialogue within the framework of theUnited Nations between developing and developedcountries and international monetary institutions in orderto lay a solid foundation for international cooperationwhich might save the world from economic surprises andsocial upheavals and also contribute positively to theinterests of all countries in the world  in the South as wellas the North.Since its beginning  the Arab-Israeli conflict hasbeen given high priority on the agenda of the internationalcommunity. International efforts to contain this conflicthave been unrelenting every time it has exploded  becausethe Middle East  with its singular strategic position  itstremendous material and spiritual wealth and its renownedcultural heritage can be considered the most sensitiveparameter for measuring the state of world peace andsecurity.The peace process that was launched in Madrid wasseen as a new beginning to settle this conflict with theend of the cold war. The Madrid terms of reference  theAmerican assurances and the results reached constituteda firm basis which cannot be ignored under anycircumstance.The insistence of the Israeli Prime Minister onpursuing a policy hostile to peace and his rejection of therights of the Arabs to regain the occupied territories underthe pretext of security for Israel alone — at a time whenIsrael?s military arsenal is considered one of the mightiestand most modern in the world — constitute a challengenot only to the Arabs  but also to the will of theinternational community as a whole.It seems clear that Israel does not limit itsconception of security to the Arab territories it occupies;rather it is working to establish a military alliance in theregion which will undermine the peace process and putthe region on a path fraught with dangers  tension and thepotential for explosion.11What the region and its peoples need is not theestablishment of alliances and axes but the establishment ofa just and comprehensive peace  based on the fullwithdrawal of Israel from the occupied Syrian Golan to theline of 4 June 1967 and from the south of Lebanon and itswestern Bekaa  in implementation of the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. Inaddition  the legitimate national rights of the Palestinianpeople must be safeguarded  including their right to self-determination and the establishment of their independentState on their national territory.The peace process faces a real crisis. It has been in astalemate on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks for over twoyears. It faces erosion on the Palestinian track  as well  dueto Israeli intransigence. The entire peace process is on thewane and will be so long as the Israeli Government rejectsthe principle of land for peace and attempts to impose onthe Arabs a peace based on occupation and settlerism.However  Syria has been and continues to be committed topeace; we consider it a strategic option that requires theresumption of negotiations from the point at which theystopped on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks and thatcontinues to build on the commitments and undertakingsreached until a just and comprehensive peace is establishedin the region.Syria stresses its concern for the unity and territorialintegrity of Iraq and calls for alleviating the suffering ofour brotherly Iraqi people and lifting the sanctions imposedon them according to a specific timetable. In the meantime Iraq is called upon to implement the remaining SecurityCouncil resolutions in a way that guarantees a justresolution to the issue of Kuwaiti prisoners of war.Syria also calls for an end to the sanctions imposed onLibya  for it is our belief that it is possible to address thiscrisis in an appropriate legal framework  separate from anypolitical motivation. We fully support the Libyan demandfor a solution to this problem on a just basis.Syria stands against terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations; we condemn it on all fronts. Wedifferentiate between terrorism and the legitimate struggleof peoples against foreign occupation and for self-determination and national liberation  which cannot beconsidered terrorism. We also condemn killing innocentcivilians everywhere  just as we condemn the Stateterrorism exercised by Israel against the Arabs.We believe that resorting to force and violence ininternational relations  in contravention of the UnitedNations Charter and the principles of international law does not promote international legitimacy but leaves thedoor wide open to the law of the jungle. In this regard Syria finds the United States attack on the Al-Shifapharmaceutical facility in Sudan to be unjustified. Webelieve that this attack constitutes a violation of theprinciples of international law and the Charter of theUnited Nations. From this perspective  Syria supports therequest of the Sudanese Government to the SecurityCouncil to send a fact-finding mission to investigate theAmerican allegations relating to that installation.Syria follows with great concern the sharp conflictssweeping some African countries. While expressing itssolidarity and support to the peoples of Africa  Syria callson the international community to make the necessaryefforts in close cooperation with the Organization ofAfrican Unity to find solutions to these conflicts in amanner that consolidates peace  stability and security onthe African continent. The international community is alsocalled upon to give all types of support to enable AfricanStates to eliminate the scourge of poverty and freethemselves of the burden of debt in order to achievesustainable development.We are also following with great concern thesituation in the Republic of Somalia. We urge all theSomali parties to respect their undertakings andimplement the agreements reached among them. We callon them to put the national interests of Somalia above allother considerations and to cooperate with Arab  Africanand international efforts towards the realization ofnational reconciliation so as to guarantee the return ofsecurity and stability for the Somali people.Syria supports the measures taken to ensure theachievement of peace and security in the Koreanpeninsula  and we also support the Korean people?saspirations to achieve unity.Syria stresses anew the urgent need to take allnecessary steps  as promptly as possible  to end theeconomic  commercial and financial sanctions imposed bythe United States against Cuba for more than threedecades now. We second Cuba?s call for the resolution ofdifferences between the two countries through dialogue on the basis of equality  mutual respect and good-neighbourly relations.12Syria is extremely concerned about the generalsituation in Afghanistan and the continuing bloodshed.Syria strongly condemns the killing of the Iranian diplomatsin Mazar-i-Sharif. This was a violation of the principles ofinternational law and of the tolerant values of Islam. Wecall upon all parties to exercise self-restraint and to worktowards reaching a peaceful solution and nationalreconciliation.Syria supports the stand of the Non-AlignedMovement which considers the reform of the SecurityCouncil  its democratization and the expansion of itsmembership as part and parcel of a package deal that is notsubject to a specific timetable. We emphasize the principlesof equal sovereignty among States and equitablegeographical representation according to the provisions ofthe Charter. Syria also believes that the exercise of the rightof veto should be reduced and that its scope should belimited.We support the position of the Non-AlignedMovement concerning the concept of general agreement specifically that such agreement should  in conformity withthe provisions of Article 108 of the Charter  require amajority of two thirds of Member States.The Secretary-General?s proposed plan for reform wasa positive step to improve the Organization?s efficiency andenable it to cope with the changes required in the nextstage. The Syrian delegation participated in the discussionsrelevant to reforming the United Nations in the spirit ofcollective responsibility of Member States to enhance therole of this international Organization. We believe thatMember States do have a major role to play inconsultations concerning the reforms and in the resultingresolutions.The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights is an important occasion for re-emphasizing the fact that all human rights are universal andinterrelated and that the international community shouldaddress human rights in a just and comprehensive manner free of double standards and manipulations for politicalpurposes or to interfere in the internal affairs of States  andtaking into account the national characteristics and thehistorical  cultural and religious elements of each peopleand nation.Humankind continues to aspire to a world free ofwars  poverty  ignorance and injustice  a world in whichjustice  security  stability and sustainable developmentprevail. Peoples of the world have pinned their hopes onthe United Nations Charter  which specifies among itspurposes the importance of maintaining world peace andsecurity  developing relations among nations based onrespect for equality and self-determination of peoples achieving international cooperation in the economic social and cultural fields and enhancing basic freedomsfor mankind everywhere.Let us work together seriously and confidently onthe basis of these principles and objectives. Let us notdisappoint future generations. This is not an easy task  butit is certainly a noble one  which deserves our efforts sacrifice  patience and wisdom."

In this context  may herest assured of the renewed support of the Republic ofChad for the reforms that are needed to make ourOrganization better able to achieve its goals in the contextof the rapid changes sweeping the world.The ever growing problems facing humankind —including  inter alia  civil wars  famine  epidemics andpandemics  terrorism  and the evils of globalization andmondialisation — are making our United Nationsincreasingly sought after to solve them. More than ever the Organization needs the genuine cooperation of each ofits Members in support of its efforts to ensureinternational peace and security  the sine qua non foreconomic and social development. The ongoingparticipation of the Republic of Chad in the work of thisAssembly; its payment of all its arrears  despite itsfinancial difficulties; and the presence of elements of theChad Armed Forces in the Inter-African Mission toMonitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreements(MISAB) and  later  in the United Nations Mission in theCentral African Republic (MINURCA) bear witness toour desire to cooperate with our Organization in theaccomplishment of its noble mission. But this effortwould never have been possible had we not first soughtto stabilize the situation in our own country  which  untilrecently  was beset by a civil war fuelled by all types ofoutside interference.In fact  since 1 December 1990  when President IdrissDeby came to power  Chad has resolutely followed the pathof national reconciliation and pluralistic democracy. Therule of law has become a tangible reality  based on theConstitution adopted by referendum on 31 March 1996 which was followed by presidential and legislativeelections. In order to complete the process ofdemocratization  the Government  together with theNational Assembly  is establishing the other institutionsprovided for in the Constitution.In this respect  I am pleased to point to the adoptionby my country?s National Assembly  in early 1998  laws onthe Supreme Court and the High Court of Justice. The billon the Constitutional Council is currently being considered.At its next session  the National Assembly will consider abill on decentralization.In the economic sphere  I would note that the extremepoverty in my country is not irreversible  since we haveexcellent opportunities to emerge from it. This convictionhas prompted my Government to take the course ofeconomic and financial reform with the principal goals ofrestoring the macroeconomic balance  disengaging the Statefrom public enterprise and promoting the private sector.Thus  since July 1995  the Government of Chad hasadopted a medium-term strategy for economic recovery.This is aimed at laying the foundations for sustainableeconomic and social development.In this framework  a structural adjustment programmehas been adopted in order to achieve high and sustainedeconomic growth  reduced external imbalances andstrengthened competitiveness. This programme  supportedby the International Monetary Fund in the framework of atriennial agreement under its Enhanced StructuralAdjustment Facility  covering the period 1995-1998  hasalso enjoyed financial assistance from the World Bank andother multilateral donors.Apart from our hopes for agriculture and animalhusbandry in the fight against poverty  we rely on theimportant mineral and oil resources beneath Chadian soil.The exploitation of our oil is one of my Government?spriorities  because with the expected oil revenue  Chad?sincome will increase substantially early in the next century not to mention the fact that the flow of oil investments willalso generate important added value for local enterprises.In this respect  we have tirelessly reaffirmed that oilincome will be allocated to the fight against poverty andwill help to finance health  social and educational materials;the modernization of agriculture and husbandry; andinfrastructure and environment. In other words  the entirepopulation of Chad will benefit from this oil manna.In this respect  we stress the fact that Chad is one ofthe rare countries of the world that is managing such asensitive endeavour as oil exploitation in all transparency.Meetings and seminars with the various sectors of civilsociety and open parliamentary debates have beenorganized by the Government in order to explain thisendeavour in all its aspects.Despite the political and economic advances in mycountry  we deplore the campaign of lies that is being ledagainst my Government. Indeed  for some time now disinformation and untruths have been spread among theinternational institutions and some friendly countriesabout both the oil question and the human rights situationin Chad.Nonetheless  my country has made considerableprogress in the area of human rights. We have ratified themain international instruments relating to human rightsand have suppressed all extraordinary judicial procedures such as the court martial established in 1991. To betterguarantee respect for human rights  we have establisheda national commission for human rights  which choosesat its own discretion the questions to be considered andgoverns its own activities.After more than three decades of civil war  foreigninterference and ruthless dictatorships  Chad  thanks to thedetermination of its people  has succeeded in turning thedark pages of its history and in making the necessaryinstitutional reforms for the establishment of a state oflaw and pluralist democracy  and it now legitimatelyexpects the international community?s help in fulfillingthe fundamental right of the people of Chad to economicand social development.In this respect  I solemnly invite friendly countriesand international institutions  governmental and non-governmental alike  interested in Chad?s development toparticipate extensively in the Geneva IV round table  tobe held from 20-22 October 1998  on strategicdevelopment options for Chad for 1998-2001.Our appeal for the development of our countrywould be incomplete if we were not to raise a serioussubject of concern  the improvement of our environment which has been endangered by the approximately 1million mines that infest a large part of our national2territory and prevent all development activity. In thisrespect  we reiterate the appeal for international assistancemade here by President Idriss Deby at the commemorationof the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization and reiteratedby our delegation at the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly.Our concerns about domestic policy in no way divertour attention from the international situation. In Africa  weare gratified at the progress made in settling conflictsthrough negotiation. This applies particularly to WesternAfrica  under the auspices of the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS)  particularly in Liberia Sierra Leone and  more recently  in Guinea-Bissau.The efforts undertaken in the Central African Republicfirst by MISAB and then by MINURCA have yieldedsatisfactory results. My country is proud to have been aparticipant in these efforts since 1996. We are duty-boundto work towards consolidating peace  which remains fragilein that fraternal neighbouring country. The legislativeelections will be an important stage in the peace process and the elections therefore call for the full support of theinternational community. A premature withdrawal ofMINURCA  before these elections which are but one stageof the process  would endanger the costly efforts made forpeace. In these troubling times throughout Central Africa we appeal for much more patience in order to enable theinternational community to assist the Central African peopleeven farther along the path of national reconciliation andsecurity  as the United Nations does everywhere.The strengthening of existing structures for theprevention  management and settlement of conflicts inAfrica must be encouraged and firmly supported by theinternational community  regardless of whether it is amatter for the Standing Advisory Committee on SecurityQuestions in Central Africa or the United Nations RegionalCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa  located atLomé  Togo.Despite the existence of these mechanisms  hotbeds oftension have emerged here and there in Africa  dangerouslythreatening peace and security on that continent  whichmore than ever needs peace and security for its economicrecovery. Thus  we deplore the persistent situation of warin the countries of the Great Lakes region  and particularlythe ravages of war in the Democratic Republic of theCongo. It is urgently necessary that genuine efforts be madeby the international community under the aegis of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  with the cooperationof the States of the region  so that the Democratic Republicof the Congo can exercise its right to nationalreconciliation  the unity of its sons and daughters  itsterritorial integrity and national sovereignty. This meansthe withdrawal of the forces of aggression that occupy theentire eastern part of that brotherly country.With respect to Angola  Chad believes thatMr. Jonas Savimbi is the only party responsible for thedeterioration of the situation. We therefore make aheartfelt appeal to the international community and theSecurity Council to acknowledge the new direction takenby UNITA and to provide it the assistance necessary topromptly achieve the terms of the Lusaka Protocol.In the Horn of Africa  the armed conflict betweenEthiopia and Eritrea threatens peace in that part of thecontinent. The relative calm obtained  thanks to OAUmediation  must be observed in order to facilitatenegotiations with a view to a peaceful settlement of thedispute between those two fraternal countries.Close to those two countries  the situation of latentwar in Somalia is far from reassuring. In that country where the different factions in conflict are sowing terror war could break out at any time. It is important to makea concerted effort to reintegrate that country into theinternational community.The consequences of these hotbeds of tensionafflicting the African continent can be measured in thenumber of homeless people and refugees moving fromone country to another in search of a land that willwelcome them  not to mention the very high number ofinnocent victims  including maimed and starvingindividuals.Having recently suffered the horrors of warourselves  our country is keenly aware of the value ofpeace and appeals to the collective conscience to bring anend to the multiple tragedies affecting innocent Africanpopulations.The same challenges confront us in Bosnia andHerzegovina  where the implementation of the DaytonAgreement must be firmly supported so that a lastingpeace can be established in that part of the world.In Afghanistan  Chad urges the Taliban in power inKabul and the opposition coalition to undertake a frankand sincere dialogue in order to achieve a lasting peace.3In the Middle East  the hope of peace raised by theOslo accords is fading daily because of the stalled Israeli-Palestinian talks. We urge all the parties concerned torespect their commitments  as this is the only way toachieve a lasting peace in that part of the world. Neitherviolence nor extremism  much less intransigence  willenable the achievement of a just and definitive solution tothis crisis which has lasted too long.My country  Chad  noted with satisfaction the end ofthe bipolar world and the radical change that took place inthe international situation. By resuming diplomatic relationswith the Republic of China on Taiwan  the Government andthe people of Chad had only one consideration: to diversifyrelations of friendship with cooperation with all the peace-and justice-loving countries of the world on the basis ofequality and solidarity. Thus Chad gave its support to therequest that an examination of General Assembly resolution2758 (XXVI) of 25 October 1971 be inscribed on theagenda of the fifty-third session  because of the radicalchanges in the international situation and the coexistence oftwo Governments  one on each side of the Straits ofTaiwan.We are gratified at the progress  however slow  thathas been achieved in recent years in the fields ofdisarmament and the fight against narcotic drugs. However we denounce the scandalous trade in conventional weaponswhich fuel so many conflicts and bring bloodshed to somany parts of the world. We are prepared to support allmeasures aimed at combating this scourge.Furthermore  and in the face of the globalization anduniversalization that is engendering the arroganttriumphalism of the powerful  the international communitymust rise above the disparities among its members and findadequate ways of overcoming the negative impact on afragile international balance of the mutations that arecurrently taking place. In so doing  it must give priority toconsensus and agreement among its members and rejectunilateral actions conducted in its name but in disdain forthe principles and rules that govern it. Therefore  it isurgent that peace- and justice-loving nations speak out todenounce the frequent interferences in the internal affairs ofStates and take a unanimous stand against the economicsanctions that are often ineffective and are unjust andfraught with social consequences  as well.For this reason  Chad once again firmly condemns thehaste with which unilateral air strikes were made against asimple pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan  causing theloss of innocent lives in that fraternal neighbouring country.In this respect  Chad reiterates its support to the appealmade from this rostrum by the current Chairman of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to send a fact-finding mission to study the matter.As for the Lockerbie affair  while we support theresolution of the latest OAU summit  in Ouagadougou  onthis question  Chad is also gratified that the United Statesand Great Britain have agreed that the trial of the twosuspects take place in a neutral country. We appeal tothose two countries and to the Netherlands to undertakenegotiations with Libya  either directly or through themediation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in order to conclude an arrangement for theimplementation of Security Council resolution 1192(1998) and thus to establish the modalities for the trial including measures of security and guarantees for thesuspects. These negotiations are indispensable if thisquestion is to be truly resolved.That being said  may there be no mistake as to themeaning of our policy. We wholeheartedly condemnterrorism in all its forms. The many victims of the recentterrorist actions against the United States Embassies atNairobi and Dar-es-Salaam  as well as the equally tragicreactions that have ensued  force us to reaffirm stronglythat no end can justify such recourse to an aggressive andblind fundamentalism.It is clear that the infinite despair in which millionsof human beings are submerged cannot be alleviated bythe use of force  wherever it may originate. Furthermore the radical fundamentalism often inveighed against todayis not the preserve of any specific faith. To attribute itlightly to one religion or one people inevitably reducesthe scope of the actions undertaken to circumscribe it.We therefore support the plan for the urgentconvening of an international conference under UnitedNations auspices in order to establish the modalities of aneffective international cooperation for the total eradicationof terrorism in all its forms.On another matter which is related to the precedingconcerns  we would like to express our deep concern atthe present state of international economic relations. It isindeed deplorable to see that the process of detente thatis evident in the international political situation and in theglobalization of the economy has in no way modified theunequal economic relations  so that the imbalancesbetween rich and poor States are increasingly glaring. Ifgrowth has continued in the developed countries for4almost fifty years now  the opposite has taken place in thedeveloping countries  where growth has stagnated  if notregressed. Thus  the eternal problems of indebtedness anddeterioration in the terms of trade have been compoundedby the problem of the constant marginalization of thedeveloping countries  in particular those of our Africancontinent  on international economic circuits.In order to achieve the objective of lasting growth anddevelopment in the interests of humankind  we invite theinternational community to work for a system based onrules that are just  fair and more open; for the progressiveliberation and elimination of obstacles to trade  in bothgoods and services; for the rejection of all forms ofprotectionism; etc. It is therefore urgent that concretemeasures be adopted to make it possible for Africa toachieve sustained growth which should lead to realdevelopment.In conclusion  we would like to reiterate our completesupport for the United Nations both in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and in the establishment ofa just and equitable international order.But if the United Nations wishes fully to play the roleit has been given  it must adapt to the realities of the day.It must be credible and its legitimacy must be undeniable.The Security Council in its current form is far fromenshrining these ideals  for two principal reasons: first  itscomposition does not at all reflect the views of the wholeand especially of the least and the smallest; secondly  itpursues a policy based on a double standard  which makesits decisions increasingly vulnerable.Given this situation  the need for Security Councilreform is self-evident. Such reform must respond to theexpectations of Member States. This means that there mustbe a recomposition of the Council as well as a review of itsdecision-making procedures  in particular the right of veto which is used and abused. We must reaffirm the positiontaken by the last Assembly of Heads of State andGovernment of the Organization of African Unity: theAfrican continent must be equitably represented in thatorgan where the fate of all humanity is at stake. It isinconceivable and impossible to accept that an importantsector of humanity continues to endure the harshness ofdecisions in which it did not participate."
"160",6748,"TGO",53,1998,"Allow me first of all  on behalf of the people of Togo andPresident Eyadema and his Government  to join in thecongratulations extended to you  Sir  since the beginning ofour work on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session.We would also like to congratulate his your illustriouspredecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  on the effectivemanner in which he conducted the work of the fifty-secondsession.I would furthermore like to pay tribute to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and his colleagues fortheir continuous efforts to champion the noble ideals ofpeace  justice  progress and solidarity embodied by theUnited Nations.By way of analysing the situation in Africa  I wouldlike to present Togo?s perspective of the world?s problemsin the context of improved international cooperation.Africa is democratizing  but it needs peace andsecurity if it is to succeed. Africa is the continent mostaffected by the great scourges of the planet  but itsdevelopment is also part of a dynamic of progress. Thescourges hampering its development are well known:endemic disease  drought  poverty  political instability ethnic conflicts  civil wars and regional conflicts. Thesescourges have a tendency to eclipse the successes.Since the signing of the Abuja Treaty in 1991  Africahas set itself a timetable for integration in the framework ofthe African Economic Community  on the basis ofstrengthening regional groupings of western  northern central  eastern and southern Africa. These groups arethemselves actively engaged in seeking joint solutions tothe challenges confronting its member States.The rate of economic growth of certain African Statescontinues to make progress thanks to good managementpolicies.A vast democratic movement has begun throughoutour continent to build States based on the rule of law.This movement is being followed up by the adoption ofnew constitutions and the establishment of independentbodies to implement them. Numerous heads of State andof Government have had their mandates challenged inperiodic elections. The majority and the oppositionrepresentatives of the people have seats in the newrepresentative bodies — parliaments and nationalassemblies. The success of the functioning of these newconstitutional bodies is ensured by independent legalbodies. The press is now free  as are labour unions inmost of our States.I am emphasizing these institutional aspects ofbuilding a new Africa because the respect and support ofthe international community for these institutions is afactor in favour of peace within the particular States  andtherefore for peace in our regions.Experience has shown us that a domestic conflict  bygiving rise to an exodus of people to neighbouringcountries  also has a rapid and serious effect on the latter.I repeat  as the current situation in the Great Lakes regiondemonstrates  such domestic conflicts can lead to regionalcrises.Togo is among the States that voluntarily establishedinstitutions that safeguard the rule of law and that canarbitrate disputes that may arise in the new context ofdemocratization. It is in this framework that theConstitutional Court of Togo declared the results of thepresidential election of 21 June 1998 after havingarbitrated the disputes that resulted from the election.Togo?s respect for institutions is the very foundationof democracy and peace. On behalf of my Government I would like to invite all of our partners at the UnitedNations to support without distinction the efforts of all thecountries of Africa that commit themselves to the difficultbut rewarding path of building a State of law. This is theprice of peace in Africa.While we can be gratified at the end of certainconflicts — particularly in Liberia and Sierra Leone —and while solutions are in sight to relieve the tensions inGuinea-Bissau  we cannot fail to express our concern overthe crisis in the Great Lakes region  the resumption ofhostilities in Angola  the continuation of the crisis inSomalia and  finally  the armed confrontation betweenEthiopia and Eritrea.7We cannot stress enough the advantages of dialogueand negotiation as the best paths to follow for settlingdisputes between States on the basis of respect for theirterritorial integrity.In that connection  the international community mustput an end to the embargo imposed on Libya byimplementing the jurisdictional solution accepted by thatcountry and by ensuring a fair trial for the suspects in theLockerbie bombing. Togo firmly supports the efforts of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) to settle this disputeand end the suffering of the Libyan people.My country takes this opportunity to repeat itssteadfast condemnation of terrorism in all of its forms andto emphasize the need for urgent and concerted action tocombat this scourge effectively.As we are aware  the proliferation of conflictsituations in Africa remains a real cause of concern for theinternational community. I would like to note in this regardthe important report (A/52/871) presented by the Secretary-General last February at the request of the Security Councilon the causes of conflict and the promotion of durablepeace and sustainable development in Africa. That reportcontains specific recommendations on means of preventingsuch conflicts and putting an end to them  as well as onmeasures to be taken to create conditions for lasting peaceand economic growth. We hope that the implementation ofhis recommendations by the Security Council  by therelevant bodies of the United Nations system and by theBretton Woods institutions will result in the effectiveprevention of conflicts and put Africa on the road toprogress  stability and sustainable development.Elsewhere in the world  we were relieved to see thesigning of an agreement between the Government of Iraqand the United Nations  which made it possible at the lastmoment to avoid a new confrontation in the Gulf.In the same region  my Government deplores thepresent deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.We remain convinced that only the resumption of directnegotiations between the principals will make it possible tousher in an era of peace  security and prosperity in thatregion. We were relieved to see the contacts that have takenplace between Mr. Yasser Arafat and Mr. BenjaminNetanyahu through the mediation of the AmericanGovernment. Togo strongly supports this initiative.With regard to the other crises that assail the worldand jeopardize the lives of so many millions of people —particularly in Afghanistan and Kosovo — my countryhopes that through firm political will backed by candidand sincere negotiations  the parties to the conflicts willfind appropriate solutions that are acceptable to all.The world?s concerns at the dawn of the thirdmillennium are not linked solely to the effects of thephenomenon of globalization. The preservation of peace security and stability for States and peoples continues tobe an important priority. In that context  Togo is gratifiedto note that the United Nations is continuing to dischargeits mission of peacemaking and peacekeeping. In thisregard  I welcome the upcoming commemoration on 6October of 50 years of United Nations peacekeepingoperations  and I would like to pay tribute to the memoryof all the men and women who have given their lives inthe service of the Organization.My country  which firmly supports the ongoing questfor peace and security for all  would like to emphasize theneed to strengthen cooperation in this area  in a spirit ofcomplementarity  between the United Nations andsubregional and regional organizations  in accordance withChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. Theappropriate regional machinery necessary to give concreteform to this shared desire for collective maintenance ofpeace and security should be established.It is in that spirit that Togo — together with othercountries of the West African subregion and in theframework of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) — is working to establish a viable andpermanent mechanism for the prevention  managementand settlement of conflicts and the maintenance of peace.It is also within this framework that we welcome thefourth extraordinary summit of ECOWAS  held in Loméfrom 16 to 17 December 1997  and the holding of thejoint military manoeuvres named “Cohesion Kompienga?98”  held from 16 to 21 April 1998  in which the armedforces of Benin  Burkina Faso  Côte d?Ivoire  Ghana  theNiger  Nigeria  Chad and Togo participated.Among the goals of the United Nations are vigilanceover the maintenance of peace and security  theestablishment of conditions for harmonious economicdevelopment to ensure the well-being of our populationsand working for a just world in which the rights ofindividuals and peoples are not only recognized andconsecrated  but above all respected.My delegation would like to take this opportunity tohail the holding of the United Nation Diplomatic8Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of anInternational Criminal Court  which led to the adoption ofthe Statute of the court which was held in Rome from15 June to 17 July.Togo believes that peace is impossible without justice.The struggle for peace and the struggle for greater justicemust be viewed as two complementary aspects of one andthe same struggle for the realization of the deepestaspirations of all the peoples of the world. The positiveoutcome of the negotiations at the Conference resulted inthe adoption of the Statute of the court  illustrating anewthe vigour and ability of our Organization in dealing withthe present and preparing States to face the issues oftomorrow.It is for that reason that my delegation favours allefforts to reform the Organization that aim to make it moreeffective  more concerned with the problems of mankindand more democratic  so that the views of all are betterreflected and taken into account in all of its bodies.Togo would therefore like to see the rapid conclusionof discussions to allow for the permanent representation ofAfrica in the Security Council  in accordance with theresolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).The democracy we are advocating at the national level mustalso be reflected in international organizations.The United Nations has always played an importantrole in the advancement of economic and socialdevelopment and  when necessary  in providing the men women and children of the entire world with the assistanceon which their survival often depends. We are neverthelessobliged to recognize that despite the efforts made  theimprovement of standards of living  full employment andthe conditions for progress and economic and socialdevelopment have not been realized. This is particularly thecase in Africa  where continued inequality and poverty among other things  dangerously imperil the stability ofStates.It is true that African economies have performedremarkably well in the last three years; but it is also truethat the consolidation of these gains still depends on theinternational economic environment. Global economicstructural constraints — including the continuing burden ofdebt  the reduction in the flow of official developmentassistance  currency fluctuations  the inequality ofinvestment flows  weak commodity prices and marketprotectionism practised by developed countries — stillremain the major obstacles to the economic developmentof African countries.With regard to the debt burden in particular  mycountry highly values the declaration of the eighthconsultative meeting of the Organization of African Unity the African Development Bank and the EconomicCommission for Africa  which was held in Abidjan inJanuary 1998. We believe that the efforts to alleviate thedebt burden must be continued in conjunction withAfrica?s partners in order to find appropriate solutions tothis thorny problem.In this context  Togo would like to reaffirm theimperative need to hold an international conference onAfrica?s foreign debt  and it requests the support of theinternational community to translate that proposal intoreality.Regrettably  at this time of economic globalization the marginalization of Africa in terms of internationaltrade is accelerating  even though today the developmentof trade appears to be the most effective means ofmanaging the resources necessary for self-sufficiency.Indeed  the development and economic growth of AfricanStates requires as a basic condition sufficient currencyinflows from the export of their commodities. Thus  in theview of my delegation  an open world system operatingunder just and equitable regulations should be establishedin order to ensure the active participation of AfricanStates in international trade. To that end  more liberalmeasures will be required in order to promote thetransformation and diversification of their products aswell as to attract and channel investments towards them.The industrialized countries are attempting to joinforces. This shows clearly that today no country regardless of how powerful it is  can alone provide for itsown economic growth and cope with increasinglyaggressive international competition. Given this state ofaffairs  the African countries have in recent yearsreaffirmed their will to pool their potential by establishingand strengthening subregional units. It is clear that thedevelopment policy of our countries must be consideredwithin this framework  for this is the only way that Africacan become a fully fledged and reliable partner in theworld of the twenty-first century.In this respect  the entry into force of the Treatyestablishing the African Economic Community serves asa good illustration of the will of African States to unitetheir efforts to ensure their own progress.9Togo  which is firmly committed to the policy ofeconomic integration of the continent  wishes to take thisopportunity to once again urge the international communityto support the efforts of the African countries to achieve thegoals of sustainable development which alone can promoteprosperity and the well-being of their peoples.I should like here to underscore an emerging trend inAfrica: inter-African parliamentary control of the activitiesof our regional and subregional organizations. It is in thisframework that an inter-parliamentary committee of theWest African Economic and Monetary Union was createdrecently in Bamako; its work is already under way. Also inthis framework  a parliamentary assembly was establishedin the countries of the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC)  in southern Africa. This shows thatwhile  generally speaking  people tend to despair of thefuture of Africa  we young Africans have faith that Africais on the right path as long as we have the unswervingsupport of the international community.Here I should like once again to welcome thecommitment of the Japanese Government to Africa throughthe Tokyo Conference on the Development of Africa(TICAD)  aimed at seeking solutions to the continent?sdevelopment problems. My delegation would like here onceagain to thank the Japanese Government for all of itsefforts to strengthen cooperation between Africa and Asia and congratulates it on the convening of TICAD II nextOctober in Tokyo.Moreover  Togo believes that the combination ofTICAD with other initiatives — in particular that of theUnited States on equitable partnership  known as 20/20Vision; that of the European Union  within the frameworkof the Lomé Convention; and that of the francophoneworld  within the framework of the Hanoi Plan ofAction — will help safeguard and consolidate the spirit ofsolidarity  which Africa wishes to see ever more active andever more purposeful.My country is convinced of the need for solidarityamong the Members of our Organization and is deeplycommitted to the noble ideals of peace  freedom and justiceand of economic  social and cultural progress  which theUnited Nations has contributed to advancing. During thisyear of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights  Togo fervently hopes to witness therealization  for the benefit of all humankind  of theprofound aspirations of peoples to greater freedom and toa world of peace in which the struggle against poverty famine and illness grows is daily strengthened."
"161",6793,"THA",53,1998,"On behalf of theGovernment and the people of the Kingdom of Thailand  Ishould like to extend my warmest congratulations to HisExcellency Mr. Didier Opertti upon his unanimous electionto the presidency of the current session of the GeneralAssembly. I wish also to take this opportunity to pay tributeto his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Hennadiy Y.Udovenko of Ukraine  for his leadership and his tirelessdedication to the heavy responsibilities entrusted to himduring the past year. With his wisdom and experience  heled us successfully through the fifty-second session  whichtook place against a backdrop of political transition andeconomic transformation in the world  as well as of thereform of this Organization. Allow me also to warmlywelcome Ms. Louise Fréchette  who has brought creativeenergy to her new post of Deputy Secretary-General sincethe beginning of this year.As we gather here to discuss United Nations reformand other issues of vital importance to this world body  itis imperative for us to be clear about what exactly we aretrying to achieve. To my mind  many vital questions begto be answered as the United Nations prepares to meet thechallenges of a new millennium.One question that looms large above all others is:What kind of global community do we wish to see in thenext century  and what role can the United Nations playin such a community?As Members of the United Nations  what are ourshared responsibilities  both individually and collectively in working towards a global community that fulfils thevision of our founding fathers and reflects today?schanging needs? By what means can we prevent thecurrent economic crisis from undermining the vastprogress achieved during the past decade in the social economic and political areas? In what ways can wetransform the challenges emanating from the crisis intoopportunities to strengthen the fabric of peace  prosperityand stability around the world? When will we achieve ourcommon aspiration to a world in which democracy ischerished  human rights are respected  sustainabledevelopment is practised  economic freedom is exercised and people are given the opportunity to realize their fullpotential?I do not pretend to have the answers to all thesequestions  but I am convinced that  together  we can assistone another in addressing these crucial issues.The United Nations should be exactly what its nameimplies: a community of nations united in a commonvision and common purpose. For in this age ofglobalization  our destinies are truly intertwined andinterdependent. One has to look no further than theeconomic crisis to realize how necessary it is for us tothink and act as a global community possessed of a senseof shared responsibility.For  indeed  the United Nations can only be what wemake of it. The United Nations can only be an effectiveand efficient instrument for peace and prosperity to theextent that we  the Members of the United Nations demonstrate the will  the resolve and the commitment tomove the reform process forward.I therefore wish to take this opportunity to commendthe Secretary-General for having so promptly respondedto the calls by the Member States to reform the24managerial structure and working methods of the Secretariatand to strengthen cooperation among various UnitedNations agencies. Now that the Secretary-General has donewhat we have called upon him to do  we  the MembersStates  must do our part to reform the intergovernmentalstructure and processes of the United Nations  and we mustdo so expeditiously.What is plain is that the reforms will not be of anymeaningful consequence if we fail to deliver on oursupport  politically and financially. It certainly serves nopurpose to talk about an enhanced role of the UnitedNations if we fail in our responsibility to provide theUnited Nations with the means and resources to carry outits mission. For its part  Thailand has done its best to meetits obligations despite the financial difficulties we are goingthrough. That is the least we can do to show our steadfastsupport for the United Nations and the causes it represents.But the reforms are not an end in themselves. Theyare the means by which we can make the United Nationsrelevant to the demands of the changing times. No one canpredict what new challenges the twenty-first century maybring. Only one thing is certain  such challenges will bemore complex  more multifaceted and more demanding thanever before. At the same time  many current issues promiseto play an increasingly significant role in the internationalarena. These include globalization  human rights disarmament and illicit drugs. Allow me to touch briefly oneach of these issues.The biggest and most complex challenge of our timeis globalization  which has emerged as an elemental forceof nature  not yet well understood but with the power tobuild and the power to destroy. In the early part of thisdecade  we saw mainly the positive side of globalization —more open markets  greater material well-being  morechoice and more convenient dissemination of ideas andinformation. As the end of a decade draws nearer  we arealso seeing that globalization is not without cost.Economies are succumbing to volatility beyond theirborders. Seemingly isolated crises can send shock wavesrippling through the international system.Over the past year  Thailand and a growing number ofcountries have been penalized by the global financialmarkets. We recognize that domestic institutionalshortcomings were partly to blame for the mismanagementof the economy. Reforms are therefore being undertaken inmany of the affected economies  but they will likely takemany years to bear fruit. At this point it seems clear thatthe severity of the crisis has been all out of proportion tothe severity of our mistakes. The crisis is no longer anAsian crisis  but a global crisis and a systemic crisis.The industrialized countries  insofar as they stand togain the most from globalization and lose the most froma worldwide retreat from it  have an obligation to helpcontain the spreading contagion. The perception that thiswill stop at a certain point — at Thailand  at Indonesia at South Korea — has time and again been proven wrong.Now  with the world teetering on the brink of globalrecession  the G-7  by acting to check the financial crisis will not be performing an act of global charity but one ofself-preservation.The destabilizing potential of unfettered globalfinancial flows  as demonstrated by the Asian crisis points to a glaring gap in our global economicarchitecture. I wish to add my voice to the growing callsfor the international community — developing nations inconjunction with developed nations — to come up witha mechanism or framework entrusted with the globalmonitoring and regulation of international financial flows.The United Nations should propose a world conference onthe world financial system to be held in the very nearfuture. The proposal by the Committee for DevelopmentPlanning (CDP) of the United Nations for the creation ofsuch a body or mechanism also merits seriousconsideration.While such a mechanism is being worked out  wemust pay greater attention to the human and social costsof the crisis. To cushion the impact  the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its dialoguepartners will be discussing how to promote humanwelfare and development within the framework of theASEAN Post-ministerial Conference caucus on socialsafety nets proposed by Thailand.In this age where ideas can be carried far and wideby the currents of global media  such concepts asdemocracy  human rights and sustainable developmenthave stirred the imagination of peoples in developingnations everywhere. My delegation would like tocongratulate the Secretary-General for strengthening thework of the United Nations on human rights  particularlyin bringing Geneva and New York together andappointing Mary Robinson as the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights. Her grace  herexperiences  her devotion and her competency willcontribute to the protection and promotion of humanrights worldwide.25ln today?s global village  human rights have becomenot a luxury but a necessity. Advancing the cause of humanrights makes sense not only from a philosophicalstandpoint  but also from a pragmatic standpoint. Obstaclesto and violations of human rights lead to the displacementof populations across borders  with a host of attendantsocial and economic problems  posing an immense burdenon countries of first refuge  receiving third countries  andthe international community as a whole.The primary responsibility for observing human rightsnecessarily rests with the State. Respect for human rightsand civil liberties must begin at home. But progress can beslow. Democratization is by definition driven by eachcountry?s own internal dynamics.In South-East Asia the economic crisis has givenmomentum to the struggle for democracy and human rights.Governments are being challenged to reconcile rising publicexpectations and demands with pre-existing norms andinstitutional structures. It may well be that democracy andhuman rights will gain ground as a result  but there is alsoa lurking danger that Governments will respond harshly andreverse any progress made.In Cambodia  for example  a fragile democracy istaking root  but the outcome is far from certain. Continuingfactionalism threatens to unravel the peace and stabilitywhich took so many years to build. As a neighbour Thailand cannot but be concerned that should this latestattempt at democracy fail  mission fatigue might set in.After spending so much time  energy and money onCambodia  it is not unreasonable for the internationalcommunity to expect some compromise among the politicalleadership  if only for the sake of the country?s long-suffering people. It would be unfortunate indeed if theinternational community were to give up on Cambodia andturn its attention elsewhere. But Thailand recognizes as wellas any country that building democracy is not an overnightprocess.Thailand does not advocate human rights promotionmerely because it is fashionable to do so. Human rights anddemocracy in Thailand were won the hard way — paid forwith blood  sweat and tears. Something that comes at sohigh a price cannot but command great value.Thailand therefore fully supports the United Nationsinitiative to strengthen its human rights mechanisms andbelieves that the global community should step upinternational and regional cooperation to uphold andpromote fundamental human rights.For Thailand?s part  the advancement of humanrights and democracy has become an integral part of ournational development policy. The most recentmanifestation of this effort is our new Constitution adopted in 1997. I am proud to say that thisConstitution — the most democratic in Thai history —accords human rights in Thailand their most prominentposition to date and embodies practically all the importantelements of the international instruments on human rights.Thailand also gives high priority to the advancementof women and the protection of children?s rights  inkeeping with its obligations and commitments under theframework of the international instruments  plans andprogrammes of action. Moreover  as part of thecelebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  apart from the organizationof a series of seminars  Thailand is making plans toaccede to the International Covenant on Economic  Socialand Cultural Rights.Over the past decade  humanity has made greatstrides towards global peace  but we have yet to fullyreap its dividends. Despite the end of the cold war nations continue to place greater value on armaments thanon meeting the basic needs of their people. One statisticI saw in this year?s Human Development Report was atonce startling and disheartening. It indicated that just lastyear the nations of the world spent a total of $6 billion onbasic education for their people  $9 billion dollars onwater and sanitation  $13 billion on basic health andnutrition  and a staggering $780 billion on militaryexpenditures.Of the potentially most devastating threats tohumanity  the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction remains particularly worrisome. Thailand isfully committed to the multilateral effort towardsdisarmament. We welcome the establishment of theDepartment for Disarmament Affairs  under the leadershipof Under-Secretary-General Jayantha Dhanapala  as partof the Secretary-General?s reform measures approved bythe General Assembly last year. We will also continue tosupport  financially and materially  the activities of theUnited Nations Regional Centre for Peace andDisarmament in Asia and the Pacific  in spite of financialdifficulties at home.Even as we continue our efforts to dismantle andeliminate weapons of mass destruction  we must continueto work towards reducing the conditions that wouldprompt their use in the first place. Confidence-building26through closer dialogue and interaction must be a corecomponent of any effort to build lasting peace.For nuclear weapons  the task of disarmament cannotbe left to only the nuclear Powers. The global communitymust also bring pressure to bear to emphasize that nucleararms have no place in confidence-building efforts. Thailandthus joined with nine other South-East Asian nations insigning the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free ZoneTreaty  which has already come into force. We are hopefulthat the nuclear-weapon States will support our endeavoursin this regard by acceding to the Protocol of that Treaty.Thailand also hopes for South-East Asia and the worldto be free of anti-personnel landmines. Multilateral attemptsto address the problem should not be confined merely tothe banning and destruction of landmines. The internationalcommunity must also tackle other equally important relatedissues  including the provision of financial and technicalassistance on demining to mine-affected countries as wellas humanitarian assistance to victims of landmines. Mydelegation has learned with great pleasure of the rapidprocess of ratification by signatory States  which wouldresult in the Ottawa Convention entering into force lessthan six months from now. As a signatory State  Thailandlooks forward to ratifying the Convention in the near future.A more insidious but no less destructive threat tohumanity is the scourge of narcotics. We all know thecorrosive effects that drugs have on the fabric of society the lives and dreams they shatter on a daily basis. Yet forall our efforts  the problem has never been completelyeradicated.My Government has therefore made the fight againstnarcotics a high national priority. On the occasion of thetwentieth special session of the General Assembly in June Thailand joined with other signatory countries of the 1993memorandum of understanding on drug control to issue ajoint Declaration reaffirming our strong determination tofight the narcotics problem. The following month  in July1998  Thailand and its fellow ASEAN members issued ajoint declaration stating our intention to achieve a drug-freeASEAN by the year 2020.Thailand?s success in opium-supply reduction is amatter of record. But effective drug control also requiresdemand reduction  towards which the Thai Government isalso undertaking various national measures. Accordingly we welcome the Declaration on the Guiding Principles ofDrug Demand Reduction adopted at the special sessionearlier this year.As food for thought  I would like to reiterate mydelegation?s view that  for the next decade  internationaldrug-control efforts should focus on the problem ofamphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) as well as on waysand means to prevent the diversion of precursors used forillicit drug production. This idea was recently agreed uponby members of the Non-Aligned Movement at the summitin South Africa. We urge all States to cooperate ineliminating the supply of ATS and precursors  the illicitmarket for which is now much larger than that for drugsderived from narcotic crops  the natural sources.As we approach the new century  it is becomingclear that we are also entering a new epoch in humanhistory  unlike any that has gone before. As the forces oftechnology  globalization and complex interdependenceexert ever greater influence on international relations  thecoming epoch will be one of great peril but also of greatpromise.The past year has shown us that ouraccomplishments rest on fragile foundations. The worldnow faces a crossroads. One path offers the choice ofworking harder to forge ever stronger internationalcooperation  spurred on by the prospect of continuedpeace and prosperity. Or we can choose the other pathand remain apathetic and complacent  lulled by a sense ofour own infallibility.The choice is clear enough. But the challenge will beto translate all the good intentions into effective action.Much uncertainty exists in the way international financialmarkets work  in the appropriate measures and strategiesthe international community will need to evolve inresponse to new economic and political challenges  and of course  in the age-old problems of war and peace.The United Nations  as always  will have a centralrole to play in resolving the differences among nationsand regions  in ensuring the promotion of internationalcodes of conduct and norms  in strengthening preventivediplomacy and peacekeeping  in bridging the gap betweenthe rich and poor nations  in fighting the scourge ofinternational crime  and in promoting and protectinghuman rights.The United Nations alone cannot achieve theseobjectives. The fulfilment of our common hopes andaspirations rests not only with the United NationsOrganization  but with the united nations of the world. Itis up to all of us to make the right choices  to make thedifference as humanity prepares to enter the new centurywith resolve and hope for a better world."
"162",6818,"TJK",53,1998,"First allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to the crucial post of President of the GeneralAssembly and to wish you success in guiding the work ofthis important forum.The example of Tajikistan clearly demonstrates thefruitfulness of close cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional organizations in peacekeepingactivities and highlights the need for the internationalcommunity to implement a coordinated strategy to supportthe efforts of the Government and people of a country toresolve crises  overcome instability and find ways toachieve lasting peace  national reconciliation andprosperity. We welcome the key role played by theUnited Nations in coordinating this multifaceted work.I would like once again to express my profoundgratitude to all Members of the General Assembly and theSecurity Council and to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for their growing and multifaceted support for thepeace process in Tajikistan and for their overallunflagging attention to our problems  which  regrettably remain acute.We commend the efforts of all States andinternational organizations that are acting as guarantors ofthe General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace andNational Accord in Tajikistan signed on 27 June last yearin Moscow and reached with the assistance of the UnitedNations. During the almost five years they were stationedon the territory of Tajikistan  the collective peacekeepingforces of the Commonwealth of Independent States  bytheir presence and practical actions  helped stabilize thesituation in our country and helped us continue to pursuethe complex inter-Tajik political dialogue. This has led tothe implementation of the historic agreements thatresulted from these talks.We express our deep appreciation to all our friends— countries and international organizations  and inparticular United Nations agencies — that empathize withthe people of Tajikistan in their hardships and are tryingto help them overcome them as soon as possible.While paying due tribute to the United Nations forits contribution to the strengthening of peace and nationalreconciliation in Tajikistan  we are fully aware that theprimary responsibility for restoring peaceful life in ourcountry and for the future of our motherland lies with theleadership of the Republic of Tajikistan and with theTajik opposition.19We believe that the peace process in Tajikistan though arduous  is becoming more established and ismoving towards national accord. This is born out by thefact that the work of the Commission on NationalReconciliation has definitely entered a constructive phase.The majority of refugees and displaced persons havereturned home. The process of reintegrating the UnitedTajik Opposition armed formations into the Governmentmilitary structures has begun. The majority of theparticipants in the military and political resistancemovement have been granted amnesty and released fromprison. All prisoners of war have been released. Virtuallyall the leaders of the Opposition forces have returned to thecountry and are living and working in Dushanbe.Representatives of the Opposition have been appointed toa number of important Government posts. A process isunder way to bring the nation’s laws up to date with thenew needs of political life in Tajikistan. A number of otherserious measures have also been implemented.Guided by the vital aspirations of the people andrecognizing that there is no viable alternative to full andtimely implementation of the Tajikistan General Agreement the country’s leadership is determined to continue to do allit can to ensure speedy implementation of all the provisionsof the General Agreement.We are grateful for the empathy for our problemsshown by the former Special Representative of theSecretary-General for Tajikistan  Mr. Gerd DietrichMerrem  who completed his work in May this year. We areprepared to build on this positive experience of cooperationin our relations with his successor  Mr. Jan Kubisz.Tajikistan has great respect for the United NationsMission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) and for all itsstaff. These brave and noble people are serving a lofty goalunder difficult conditions and are making a valuablecontribution to the attainment of national accord and theestablishment of peace and tranquillity in our country.The Government of the Republic of Tajikistanreaffirms its desire to continue to closely cooperate with theUnited Nations in implementing the peace accords and inthe post-conflict reconstruction of the country. We havetaken decisive action to prevent excesses similar to thetragic death this past July of four UNMOT officers  and toprovide better security for all personnel of internationalorganizations present in Tajikistan.While in no way diminishing the United Nationsobvious achievements in organizing collective internationalresponses to crisis situations in various regions of theworld  we feel obliged to draw attention once again to thedangerous  protracted Afghan conflict  which remainsunresolved. We have particular reason for highlightingthis problem — above all because we feel profoundsympathy for the continuing sufferings of the fraternalpeople of Afghanistan. Moreover  we  together with ournearest neighbours and Russia  are very seriouslyconcerned about the dangers posed by the situation inAfghanistan  which threatens to destabilize the entireCentral Asian region; to lead to a massive andspontaneous exodus of Afghan refugees across the borderinto Tajikistan; and to spread terrorism  arms and drugs.We are especially alarmed about the threat of theproliferation of religious extremism  and are joiningforces with Russia and Uzbekistan to counter it. Since theinter-Tajik reconciliation process has not been completed all these factors are impacting very negatively on thesituation in our country.As the history of Afghanistan shows  the use offorce by any internal or external actors not only isincapable of solving the problems of Afghan society  butis fraught with the danger of a new escalation of civil warin that country. In this context  we cannot but feelalarmed at developments in Afghanistan  in particular theopen disregard for the efforts of the internationalcommunity to find a political solution to the conflict andfor the Afghan people’s desire to preserve the integrity oftheir State.We  together with the other members of the AlmatyFive  are closely following developments in the IslamicState of Afghanistan. Tajikistan fully supports the UnitedNations playing a central role in coordinating allinternational efforts to find an Afghan settlement. As amember of the group of neighbours and friends ofAfghanistan  the Six plus Two group  we are firm in ouropposition to any external interference in the affairs ofAfghanistan  including interference in the form of sendingmilitary personnel and arms to that country.The Republic of Tajikistan notes the important roleplayed by the United Nations in disarmament and in awhole range of problems related to strengthening non-proliferation regimes with regard to weapons of massdestruction  particularly nuclear weapons. In this context we are joining the initiative of our neighbours to create anuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. We believe theestablishment of such a nuclear-free zone requires  firstand foremost  action on the part of prospective parties tothat treaty. We need to consider such questions as the20definitive geographical configuration of this zone; thesubstance and range of guarantees granted to the parties bythe nuclear Powers; how to deal with any transporting ofnuclear weapons through such a zone; verificationmeasures; and other matters.Our position on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia cannot overlook the factthat India and Pakistan have conducted nuclear tests. Wefully support the urgent appeal of the Security Council toIndia and Pakistan to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We believe thatboth these countries — along with the overwhelmingmajority of members of the international community —must choose the path of preventing the proliferation ofnuclear weapons.The evolution of the world economy today ischaracterized by increasing globalization and liberalization.This is reflected in the growing interdependence and greateropenness of national economies and of commodity andfinancial markets — a development that is beginning tohave both positive and negative impacts.We share the view that  in addition to national effortsto increase their economic and social potential  developingcountries and those in transition need the consolidatedsupport of the international community  including that ofthe United Nations and other multilateral institutions.Above all  we have in mind two things: first  thecreation of favourable international conditions so as toprovide open access to markets  as well as to financialresources and modern technology; secondly  assistance inovercoming poverty  protecting the environment implementing economic reforms and enhancing thecompetitiveness of national enterprises. Unless we resolvethese problems  it will be impossible to fully integratecountries in transition into the world economy.For Tajikistan those matters are all the more relevantgiven that our country has many outstanding problemscaused by the prolonged period of military confrontation  aswell as challenges directly related to its peaceful settlement.They include the humanitarian needs of rather large andvulnerable segments of the country’s population — needsfor food  medicine and health care. Vital infrastructure  inparticular for water supply and sanitation  needs to berehabilitated. And  finally  assistance is needed to helprefugees and displaced persons return home  and todemobilize and reintegrate the Tajik Opposition fightersinto civilian life.The leadership of Tajikistan is doing all it can todeal with the country’s humanitarian crisis caused by theinternal conflict  to rebuild the basic elements of thenational economy and to make progress in transformingit into a socially oriented market economy. However these efforts will be insufficient without the assistance ofmany countries and international organizations  includingthe humanitarian agencies of the United Nations systemand the charitable funds. In this regard  we note inparticular the work of the United Nations ResidentCoordinator in Tajikistan  who is responsible forcoordinating international aid to Tajikistan for its post-conflict reconstruction and further sustainabledevelopment.We hope that at this fifty-third session there will bebroad support for a resolution that fully reflectsTajikistan’s needs at this difficult stage in itsdevelopment  including the tasks related toimplementation of the General Agreement on theEstablishment of Peace and National Accord in ourcountry.We have gratefully acknowledged the consolidatedappeal drawn up by United Nations agencies to meet thehumanitarian needs of the Tajik people for 1998. Thisappeal clearly defined the priorities and set the minimumamount of external aid required. We would be grateful todonors if  reflecting the spirit of support for the peaceprocess in Tajikistan expressed at the Vienna meeting ofdonors in October last year and at the Paris conferenceheld in May this year  they would meet the goals of thisappeal.We attach great importance to continuing ourcooperation with institutions such as the World Bank andthe International Monetary Fund  which are seeking toprovide assistance during the post-conflict reconstructionand development of the Tajik economy. We hope that inthe near future this cooperation will further expand.Tajikistan consistently supports various UnitedNations efforts to protect the environment. As apredominantly mountainous country  Tajikistan seesparticular relevance in increasing the attention paid by theinternational community to the preservation of biologicaldiversity and natural mountain ecosystems. In thisconnection  we actively supported the proposal of theKyrgyz Republic to declare the year 2000 the21International Year of the Mountain. We were one of the co-sponsors of the relevant draft resolution  which we hopewill be adopted by consensus at this session.We are inspired and encouraged by the growinginterest of the United Nations in helping to solve theenvironmental problems faced by our country and othercountries of Central Asia. In our view  one of the mostserious ecological challenges posed not only to Tajikistanbut to almost all the countries of the region is to eliminatethe potential threat of the major natural disasters that couldoccur if no effective action is taken to normalize thesituation in the area of Lake Sarez  which lies 3 263 metresabove sea level and contains 17 billion tonnes of water.This poses a grave danger not only for the people ofTajikistan but also for neighbouring Uzbekistan Turkmenistan and Afghanistan  which could sustain seriousdamage in the event of a breakage of the natural dam thatwas formed at the beginning of this century as a result ofan earthquake. We count on our renewed cooperation withthe United Nations for help in dealing with this problem ina comprehensive manner.Among the many problems on the United Nationsagenda  we would like to stress the issue of combating thedrug menace  whose deleterious impact  unfortunately  hasnot bypassed our country. We fully support the coordinatingrole of the United Nations in the mobilization of theinternational community’s efforts in this area. We note theusefulness and timeliness of the convening in June this yearof the special session of the General Assembly devoted tothis issue.Tajikistan  together with its closest neighbours  istaking active steps to halt illicit drug trafficking. It isbroadening its cooperation with the United NationsInternational Drug Control Programme. As is well knownto those who have observed the situation in one of ourneighbouring countries  “narcodollars” create fertile soil forterrorism and illicit drugs and arms trafficking. We viewterrorism in all its forms and manifestations as a gravecrime against humanity. The Government of the Republicof Tajikistan vigorously condemns the acts of violence thathave been committed recently in certain countries. We callupon the United Nations and its Members to declaremerciless and uncompromising war on terrorism all overthe world.Tajikistan supports the steps being taken by theSecretary-General to reform the entire United Nationssystem to enable it to serve better in a new environment and to deal with different issues without undermining thefoundation of its activities. This point must be taken intoaccount when dealing with expansion of the membershipof the Security Council  so that this important body cancontinue effectively and expeditiously to discharge itsprimary responsibility under the United Nations Charter:the maintenance of international peace and security.We are confident that the joint efforts of Membersto reform the Organization will lead to a renewal whichwill preserve its universal character and its ability toadequately meet current and future challenges."
"163",6841,"TKM",53,1998,"First of all permit me to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti  Minister forForeign Affairs of Uruguay  on his election to the post ofPresident of the General Assembly. I would also like toaddress words of gratitude to Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenkofor the dynamic and competent manner in which he carriedout his duties as President of the previous session of theGeneral Assembly.We have very attentively studied the report of theSecretary-General on the work of the Organization andhave a very positive opinion of it. The quiet revolutionbegun by the Secretary-General one year ago — theinstitutional reform of the United Nations — has become anirreversible process tied to the rapidly changing conditionsof our new era. One of the major problems confronting thecommunity of nations is how to better understand emergingsocio-economic forces and the modalities of globalization and how to channel them towards the fulfilment of ourrequirements.Acting within the framework of the United Nations Turkmenistan is expanding the scope of its responsibilitieswithin the world community of nations. I have the honourto inform the Assembly that yesterday  here at UnitedNations Headquarters  Turkmenistan signed the KyotoProtocol to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change. Furthermore  today  during my meetingwith the Secretary-General  I handed him the instrumentof Turkmenistan?s accession to the Convention on theSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel signed by the President of Turkmenistan. Although weknow that accession by several countries more is stilllacking for the Convention?s entry into force Turkmenistan by its example would like to call on otherStates Members of the Organization to join theConvention  adding their voices in its support — or ratherin support of their citizens working for the UnitedNations.The Secretary-General?s proposal concerning realpartnerships between the United Nations and multilateralregional organizations seems to be highly relevant because regional organizations are especially effective inearly warning and preventive diplomacy  as well as infinding optimal ways to carry out globalization.The proposal on the establishment of a special unitto combat crime  terrorism  drug and weapons traffickingand money-laundering is very timely. A recent wave ofterrorist acts around the world  including the bombings inTanzania and Kenya and the killing of Iranian diplomatsin Afghanistan  requires consolidation of efforts by theworld community and decisive action. Turkmenistanresolutely fights against those negative phenomena and isprepared to contribute to the implementation of specialUnited Nations programmes aimed at eradicating theseevils.Turkmenistan welcomes the strengthening of theframework mechanism for interaction among allorganizations of the United Nations system. I would liketo take this opportunity to express on behalf of theGovernment of Turkmenistan our gratitude to themissions of the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  the United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF) the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR) and other United Nations agencies the positive results of whose work in Turkmenistancannot be overestimated. Turkmenistan also expresses itsgratitude to the donor countries supporting thoseprogrammes in our country.28We are gravely concerned about the continuing armedconflict in Afghanistan because it has a negative impact onthe stability of the region and on its economic development.Its impact also bears on Turkmenistan  which has one ofthe longest borders with Afghanistan  stretching for nearly1 000 kilometres. Turkmenistan shares the opinion thatthere is no alternative to a peaceful  negotiated settlementin that country and that violence gives birth to violence andwill only lead the process to a dead end. That is why we inTurkmenistan believe that the road to peace in that long-suffering nation lies through political negotiations among allparties to the conflict under the auspices of the UnitedNations. Turkmenistan fully supports the efforts of theUnited Nations  its Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  andhis Special Envoy  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  and joint stepsundertaken within the framework of the 6 + 2 mechanism.Turkmenistan?s President  Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov maintains constant contacts regarding this matter with theSecretary-General and with the leaders of neighbouringStates. Turkmenistan will continue to cooperate closely withthe United Nations in this regard. Interaction amongAfghanistan?s neighbouring countries  the United Nations the Organization of the Islamic Conference and all theparties concerned should lead to the termination of one ofthe most protracted and violent conflicts of this century.In view of the global changes that are taking place inthe sphere of international relations  Turkmenistan believesthat development of the Central Asian region objectivelydeserves the attention of the world. The States of thatregion have opened to the world a huge geopolitical andgeoeconomic potential  enormous natural wealth  andgeographical and transport opportunities. Turkmenistan isvigorously seeking alternative routes for delivery of itsenergy resources to international markets. In developing astrategy for the implementation of pipeline constructionprojects  we have proceeded and continue to proceed on thebasis of various options. Pipeline infrastructure based on avariety of options will ensure an increased volume andgreater diversification of energy deliveries  and will enableus to stabilize and guarantee their international distribution.There is one more issue that I would like to dwellupon in this context. It concerns inter-State pipeline routes.The problem of international pipeline routes can well becompared to that of international sea straits  which was oneof the most complex political and diplomatic challenges atthe turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Todaysuch straits ensure freedom of navigation  including forlandlocked States. Their international legal recognition iscalled for by the economic and political interests of theworld community in developing mutual relations. TheUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea adopted in 1982  reaffirmed the importance ofmaintaining freedom of navigation through straits andpassages in archipelago waters and the need to do so.Freedom of navigation  which existed in the past as aninternational custom  was legally codified as one of themost important principles of international law.In this context  of great interest are modern problemsrelating to the transportation of energy resources tointernational markets. It so happens that these enormousresources are located far away from the world markets.Usually it is landlocked nations that possess suchresources  and the choice of delivery routes and thelocation of transnational pipelines has turned into a majorproblem of our times. The resolution of this problem liesat the centre of the geopolitical and geoeconomic interestsof the States that own the resources  the transit States andthe consumer countries.In this respect  Turkmenistan promotes the initiativeof security guarantees and unimpeded transit of energyresources along international pipelines. This initiative hasalready been discussed with a number of State leaders  aswell as with the United Nations Secretary-General. Weadvocate the establishment of an international legalmechanism designed to protect the interests of theproducers  transit countries and the consumers. It isnecessary to fully preclude the possibility of pipelinesbeing used as a means of political pressure and economicdomination. The process of globalization in internationaleconomic relations calls for the elaboration of aninternational convention that will govern the regime ofinter-State pipelines and guarantee their functioning.Turkmenistan regards this matter as one of the mostimportant challenges of the coming twenty-first centuryand is prepared to sponsor a document on this matter inthe United Nations.A change in the geopolitical situation has broughtabout a new correlation of interests in the Caspian Searegion  thus making it necessary to elaborate newapproaches for the determination of the status of theCaspian Sea. The uncertainty that exists today withrespect to this issue hampers rational use of the enormouspotential of the Sea by the littoral States. A majority ofthe Caspian Sea States today favour the option of dividingthe Caspian Sea into different sectors. Turkmenistan alsosupports this approach  just as it had previously supportedthe concept of condominium.29What is most important to us under either of the twoapproaches is that the interests of all littoral States shouldbe fully taken into consideration and that cooperation in theCaspian Sea region should be built on the basis of mutualrespect  equality and mutual benefit. The Caspian Seashould be a sea of accord  and its wealth should be acommon heritage of all littoral States  with each of themhaving a right to a corresponding national share of the sea.Turkmenistan believes that the search for a new legal statusof the Caspian Sea  which would require all littoral Statesto look for reasonable compromises and display readinessto have an appropriate perception of new realities  shouldbe ensured by means of monitoring by the United Nations.Today the process of establishing a new internationallegal status of the Caspian Sea confronts a number ofdifficulties fraught with very negative consequences forregional stability. Under these conditions we consider thatUnited Nations involvement would be highly appropriate.We are happy to see that today there is a growingtendency towards restraint with respect to the attemptsaimed at associating extremism and other negativephenomena with the world of Islam. The Muslim world ismultifaceted and diverse. It faces a great range of universaland global problems of development. In this context  thereemerges an objective need for mutual understanding anddialogue among various religious trends  a need for restraintand tolerance. The President of the United States  thePresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran  the PrimeMinister of Turkey and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs ofGermany and Russia have expressed very wise andpolitically promising ideas and statements during the currentsession. In this respect  we find of great interest the ideavoiced by the President of Iran  Mr. Khatami  on declaringthe year 2001 the year of dialogue between civilizations.The point is that the resolution of today?s global challengesis inconceivable without a meaningful dialogue  anexchange of opinions and a search for ways to resolve themost pressing problems.It is already three years since Turkmenistan beganpursuing its policy as a State of permanent neutrality.Turkmenistan?s neutrality is not a shell that protects it fromdangers and tribulations of the outside world. On thecontrary  it is a position of strength that allows us toactively influence the situation in our region and the worldas a whole and to develop effective internationalcooperation. We seek to maintain equal and equitablerelations with all nations  and our national interests arepursued through economic openness and politicalimpartiality. Proceeding from this position  Turkmenistanattaches great importance to the United Nations role as aunique international institution in which all countries ofour planet have equal access to international debate andthe resolution of problems that concern them.Turkmenistan believes that on the eve of the twenty-first century the United Nations should acquire additionalpowers and responsibilities  and strengthen its currentones  by becoming a major factor in establishing aclimate of mutual respect and trust both in separateregions and the world as a whole.In conclusion  I would like to recall a proposal madeby the Secretary-General regarding the holding of theGeneral Assembly session in the year 2000 in the form ofthe Millennium Assembly. That Assembly would give allthe Member States of the United Nations a uniqueopportunity to take a look into the future  to ponder howthey perceive the United Nations of today and tospeculate on what kind of United Nations they willsupport in the next century."
"164",6909,"TTO",53,1998,"It gives megreat pleasure to extend to Mr. Didier Opertti warmestcongratulations on behalf of the Government of theRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago on his election asPresident of the fifty-third session of the GeneralAssembly. Trinidad and Tobago is indeed heartened tosee one of its regional neighbours in this post  more sogiven the close ties of friendship which exist betweenTrinidad and Tobago and Uruguay. I am convinced thatunder his astute guidance the deliberations of theAssembly will be managed with the same skill anddiplomacy with which he is known to discharge his dutiesof office.I also take this opportunity to express deepappreciation for the manner in which his predecessor  Mr.Udovenko  undertook the tasks of office during his tenureas President of the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly. The impact of his leadership and theachievements of the Assembly during the last session ofthe General Assembly can only redound to the benefit ofthis body.The United Nations has grappled  over the past 53years of its existence  with myriad issues confronting theinternational community — old issues and new issues especially those which have taken on a new dynamic inthe international relations of our Member States. Havingsuccessfully manoeuvred through the high seas of the coldwar  the United Nations continues to confront issues ofdirect concern to all its Member States. In striving toattain its goals of international peace and security andjustice for all  which are the raison d’être of the UnitedNations  this most valuable Organization to all of theworld’s peoples is now drawn to focus on development asa necessary precondition to the achievement ofinternational peace and security.We are now called upon to focus attention on thedeep-seated problems of the global community. Theseinclude the alleviation of poverty; drug abuse and illicit9drug-trafficking; environmental degradation; economicgrowth and social development of developing countries;and; more recently  the effects of the international financialcrisis. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is of theview that these challenges can be successfully addressedonly through international cooperation. No individual stateor region can in isolation rid itself of these problems.One of the principal tenets of international peace andsecurity is the rule of international law. For too long blatant disregard for international law has led to heinouscrimes which have shocked the conscience of mankind many of which have remained unpunished. Perpetrators ofgenocide  of crimes against humanity and of war crimeshave acted with impunity  causing untold human sufferingand loss of life on a massive scale.Each life lost  each soul affected  each family  societyor country touched by tragedy is one too many. Theinternational community has not  until now  established apermanent mechanism to punish the perpetrators of theseunspeakable crimes.The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is proud ofthe role played by Mr. Arthur Robinson  President of theRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago  in refocusing theattention of the international community in 1989 on theneed for the establishment of a permanent InternationalCriminal Court.We congratulate the ever increasing number of Stateswhich have worked assiduously since then to ensure theestablishment of a permanent  independent and effectiveInternational Criminal Court. At the same time  we urge allStates to continue  in the spirit of cooperation andcompromise which ensured the success of the RomeConference in July 1998  to complete the work that stillremains to be done. In this quest  we all must be evermindful of the continued threats to international peace andsecurity as well as breaches of international justice  whichare occurring even as we meet today.When the President of the Republic of Trinidad andTobago urged the international community to create apermanent International Criminal Court  it was in part arecognition of the gravity of the scourge of drug traffickingand its attendant ills  and of the pressing need for the Courtto address the question of the punishment of individualsresponsible for these crimes at an international level. At theDiplomatic Conference held in Rome  Trinidad and Tobago with the support of Caribbean Community (CARICOM)member States and some other States  was successful inensuring that the international community did not losesight of the importance of the inclusion of the crimes ofthe illicit traffic in narcotic drugs within the jurisdictionof the Court. As a result  the Diplomatic Conferencerecommended that an acceptable definition and theinclusion of drug crimes be considered by a reviewconference to be convened after the entry into force of theStatute.Drug trafficking and the associated crimes of money-laundering and trafficking in arms continue to poseserious threats to the social  economic and politicalfoundations of countries of the Caribbean  and to erodethe moral fabric of our societies. We welcome theconclusions and recommendations of the twentieth specialsession of the General Assembly on the world drugproblem  held in June 1998  and we pledge ourcommitment to cooperate at the international  regional andnational levels in the achievement of the goals and idealswhich we adopted at that session.Trinidad and Tobago will persist in its efforts on aregional basis to foster the type of cooperation that wouldcombat the scourge of drug trafficking. Such actionincludes the implementation of the 1994 BarbadosProgramme of Action  which facilitates effective drugcontrol cooperation in the region. Also  CARICOMcountries  with the assistance of the Governments ofCanada  the United Kingdom and the United States  havecreated a witness protection programme. In addition  Portof Spain is the headquarters of the secretariat of theCaribbean Financial Action Task Force on money-laundering.The Government of Trinidad and Tobago iscooperating at the bilateral level with the three countriesjust mentioned in areas such as extradition and maritimecounter-drug operations. We are also the beneficiary oftechnical assistance in the strengthening of our CounterDrug Crime Task Force to facilitate our efforts inaddressing this menace to society.Action at the national level includes theestablishment of an agency to coordinate the overallefforts against drug-trafficking and the preparation of amaster plan to deal with the problem. A strong legalframework has been put in place to enable prosecutionsand investigations. Appropriate legislation to facilitatejudicial cooperation with other countries and participationin regional and multilateral institutions has also beenenacted. Legislation currently before Parliament will10significantly improve the provisions against money-laundering.The eradication of drug-trafficking  money-laundering and the traffic in arms and their associated evils must be atask for all Member States. The deleterious effects on oursmall societies threaten future generations of our peoplesand have significant negative repercussions on ourvulnerable economies. The eradication of this affliction ofour societies is a sine qua non for development and for theachievement of international peace  security and justice.Trinidad and Tobago shares the sadness  shock andoutrage of the international community at the recentterrorist attacks on United States embassies in Tanzania andKenya  as well as at the bombings in South Africa and inIreland. This spectre of terrorism continues to rear its uglyhead in our world  in spite of the numerous efforts thathave been undertaken on a multilateral level to eradicatethis evil.At the second informal consultations of the Councilfor Foreign and Community Relations  held in New Yorkon 24 September 1998  Caribbean Community ForeignMinisters condemned the recent terrorist attacks in severalparts of the world and reiterated their strongest commitmentto the fight against international terrorism in all its formsand manifestations. They also pledged that their respectiveGovernments would consider acceding to relevantinternational conventions and protocols on internationalterrorism. The Ministers reaffirmed that the most effectiveway to confront international terrorism is through anenhanced multilateral approach and multilateral actions  andwith appropriate oversight and accountability measures.International conferences have also attempted to drawup a blueprint for addressing the environmental problemsthat plague the nations of the world. In 1992  at the EarthSummit in Rio  the international community for the firsttime linked environmental and economic issues. TheBarbados Programme of Action adopted two years later which addressed the specific problems of small islanddeveloping States  complements Agenda 21  the blueprintfor sustainable development adopted at Rio. The smallisland developing States (SIDS) Programme of Action which is to be reviewed at a special session of the GeneralAssembly next year  is therefore of critical importance tosmall island States. We anticipate that the results of thereview will be more promising than those of Agenda 21.The pace of globalization and economic liberalizationhas heightened the economic problems that developingcountries face. This is evidenced in  among other things the collapse of the financial markets  the unfair terms oftrade and the developing countries’ increasing difficultyin accessing the markets of the developed countries. Thecrisis presently facing many States and the gatheringgloom over the world economy pose very real dangers fordeveloping countries and therefore call for properlydevised strategies and the establishment of newmechanisms to ensure our survival.Recent developments within the internationaleconomic and financial arena are clear indications that theworld economic system is crying out for urgent change.The imperfections  which are becoming increasinglyglaring  can no longer be ignored. We cannot simply bearwitness to the events. We must act now or lose a goldenopportunity to influence the changes which are in the bestinterest of all humanity. We must have healthy constructive dialogue at all levels and develop thepolitical will and direction to find relevant solutions.To this end  I wish to reiterate the call made by thehonourable Minister for Foreign Affairs of Trinidad andTobago  Mr. Ralph Maraj  at the Twelfth Conference ofHeads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  held last month in Durban  SouthAfrica  for the convening of a United Nations conferenceon the world economy. It is evident from the viewsexpressed from this podium during the last two weeksthat Member States recognize the need for urgent actionat the international level to address this issue.In this volatile economic environment  small islanddeveloping States are rendered even more vulnerable bytheir inherent features of size  remoteness  insularity andsusceptibility to natural disasters. Indeed  in one fellswoop any small advances in economic development canbe brought to nought by natural disasters. The devastationwreaked by the recent Hurricane Georges on small Statesof the Caribbean bears sad testimony to this reality.Trinidad and Tobago shares the grief of its Caribbeanneighbours at the loss of life and the damage to propertysuffered in this hurricane. As is the case with otherdeveloping countries  the needs of small island developingStates cannot be addressed without the full support andcooperation of the international community. Trinidad andTobago continues to make every effort to provideassistance to the islands affected by this disaster  incooperation with the Caribbean Disaster EmergencyResponse Agency  a regional agency established to dealwith all types of disasters.11Trinidad and Tobago has succeeded to some extent inachieving integration into the world economy as itundertakes the transition from an oil-dependent  public-sector dominated economy to a more diversified market-oriented private-sector led one. There is still a pressingneed  however  for employment-generating growth fromnon-traditional labour-intensive sectors which will havemore pointed impact on the reduction in poverty andunemployment levels in our country.Our people are hurting. It is imperative therefore thatthe United Nations programmes for development bedirected more specifically towards employment creationopportunities for our peoples.Trade policy is an important area of concentration ofthe World Trade Organization (WTO). Developingcountries  including small island States  are being asked tocompete with developed countries while unequal levels ofeconomic development persist — and to do so in a verydifficult economic environment and within unrealistic time-frames. Small States must adopt a series of policy changesto reorient their economies and diversify their productionbases. While implementing these measures  they must alsodevelop their internal capacities to deal simultaneously withsuch policy changes. This cannot be achieved in the shortterm without a high degree of support from the regionaland international organizations and the internationalcommunity as a whole.It is imperative that we find innovative ways to bridgethe gap between the United Nations and private citizens. Itis in this context that we welcome the establishment of theUnited Nations Fund for International Partnerships  whichwill strengthen partnerships to support the United Nationsand its projects and deliver resources to programmes andpeoples served by United Nations agencies. The approvalof grants for projects in the broad categories of children’shealth  environment and climate change  women andpopulation  food security  drug control  poverty alleviationand landmines will contribute significantly to the pursuit ofthe goals of the United Nations. The establishment of thisFund is testimony to what can be achieved by a sharedvision and commitment to the principles and ideals of theOrganization. We urge optimum use of the benefits to bederived from the Fund.As we observe the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights this year  Trinidad andTobago would like to restate its commitment to theprotection and promotion of human rights and thefundamental freedoms of its citizens. The Constitution ofthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago guarantees humanrights and freedom to all its citizens  withoutdiscrimination based on race  origin  colour  religion orsex. The right to life  liberty  security of the person andthe right not to be deprived thereof  except by dueprocess of law  are guaranteed by the Constitution. Alsoguaranteed are the right not to be subjected to cruel andunusual treatment or punishment  the right to a fair trial freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Anindependent judiciary is ever vigilant to ensure that theserights are not abrogated or infringed.The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is fullycognizant of its duty to protect the security and well-being of its citizens  including the innocent  the victims ofviolence and the vulnerable. Their rights have also beenguaranteed by the Constitution. We do not subscribe tothe current trend that subordinates the rights of thesecitizens to those of the perpetrators of violent crimesagainst them. We are of the view that our innocentcitizens also deserve the Government’s protection of theirbasic rights to life and security of the person.We cannot speak of development without focusingspecific attention on the problems of social development poverty eradication and sustainable economicdevelopment. The international community must  nowmore than ever  jointly seek to ensure both the economicwell-being and the social development of all its peoples.In this regard  the United Nations has made tremendousstrides in its efforts to confront the problems ofdevelopment and to improve the quality of life ofhumankind. We are aware that  to this end  a number oftools have been devised to enable the internationalcommunity to build a consensus in the social andeconomic fields.It is of special significance to Trinidad and Tobagothat  in accordance with General Assembly resolution50/161 of 22 December 1995  a special session of theGeneral Assembly will be convened in the year 2000 foran overall review and appraisal of the implementation ofthe outcome of the 1995 World Summit for SocialDevelopment and to consider further actions andinitiatives.The 10 commitments undertaken at the WorldSummit in Copenhagen constitute strong imperatives byMember States and the international community toachieve social development with the well-being ofindividuals in the society at the core. One of thecommitments given priority attention at the Copenhagen12Summit was the eradication of poverty. However  povertylevels remain alarmingly high  and more practical initiativestowards eradicating poverty are essential. We are pleasedthat the General Assembly has identified this as a priorityissue and has dedicated the period 1997-2006 as the firstUnited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty inorder to achieve the goal of eradicating absolute povertyand reducing overall poverty substantially in the world.The effect of globalization and its impact on socialdevelopment must be carefully studied. The United Nationsand its relevant bodies will be a useful forum for thisdiscourse.Trinidad and Tobago sees these as some of the issueswhich the Preparatory Committee for the special sessionshould consider when it convenes its substantive sessions inMay 1999 and April 2000 to ensure that the special sessionwill be meaningful.In September 1995  at the Fourth World Conferenceon Women  firm commitments were undertaken to improvethe status of women by adopting the Beijing Declarationand Platform for Action. Follow-up activities are under wayand should continue apace vigorously to ensure that themandates of the Beijing Conference are fully implemented.An area which requires special focus is the enhancement ofwomen’s involvement in the development process. Wewelcome the decision taken by the General Assembly inDecember 1997 to convene in the year 2000 a high-levelplenary review to appraise and assess the progress achievedin the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Actionand to consider further action and initiatives.Trinidad and Tobago attaches great significance to therights of children. We are committed to ensuring that theyare neither disadvantaged nor deprived in any fashion of themeans necessary for their wholesome development and theirfull integration into society. Since the entry into force ofthe Convention on the Rights of the Child  Trinidad andTobago has taken a number of measures to promote andpursue the mandates of the Convention. Steps have alsobeen taken to achieve national awareness in this area including the elaboration of a national Plan of Action forthe Survival  Protection and Development of Children  thepromotion of the rights of children through school andcommunity outreach programmes and the establishment ofa Child Registry for monitoring children in need of specialprotection. Measures are also being undertaken with respectto the harmonization and codification of all laws relating tochildren  as well as the establishment of a Family Court.We are on a swift march towards the newmillennium. Let us  as a community of nations  renew ourresolve to work towards the achievement of the goals wehave set for ourselves: goals of peace  security  justiceand development for all. Political will and commitmentare necessary for this process  as is a genuine appreciationof the realities faced by each individual member of theinternational community in the pursuit of these goals.We  the Member States of the United Nations  mustnot lose sight of the interdependence of development andthe attainment of these ideals. As we formulate newpolicies in our strategy for the improvement of all aspectsof the lives of humankind  and as we invent newmodalities for their implementation  we are encouraged bythe many successes we have had  especially in recentyears.Trinidad and Tobago pledges to continue to workassiduously in its efforts to establish the foundations fora peaceful  secure and just world. This is the only legacywe must leave to future generations."
"165",6956,"TUN",53,1998,"It gives me great pleasure at the outset  Sir  toextend to Mr. Opertti my sincere congratulations on hiselection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-third session. We are confident that his politicalperspicacity and wide knowledge of international affairswill guarantee the success of the work of this Assembly.His election is an acknowledgement by the internationalcommunity of the active role that his friendly country Uruguay  is playing at both the regional and theinternational level for the establishment and enhancementof cooperation between peoples and the consecration ofthe universal principles of peace and justice.I should also like to extend to his predecessor Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  my warmest thanks andappreciation for the competence and dedication hedemonstrated in discharging his responsibility in order tostrengthen the foundations of change and structural reformof our international Organization so as to enable it toenter the next century with the necessary efficiency andeffectiveness.I also wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his continuous and dedicated effortsto strengthen and restructure the Organization and for hiseagerness to bolster international peace and security andthe peaceful settlement of conflicts.The last decade of the twentieth century has beencharacterized by fiftieth anniversary celebrationscommemorating the creation of many internationalinstitutions  including the United Nations. As theinternational community moves towards the twenty-firstcentury  it is called upon to evaluate its accomplishments20in giving effect to the principles and goals of the UnitedNations and in delineating the contours of the future witha view to ensuring security  peace and development for allthe peoples of the world.In this regard  ensuring a better world for futuregenerations — a world in which security  justice  stabilityand prosperity for all prevail — remains the highestcommon goal  whose achievement requires efforts by all.This requires the international community to show anunwavering determination and to sustain efforts to establisha world order  built by all States  consolidating theobjectives and principles of the United Nations andfulfilling the spirit and the letter of the Charter  on the basisof international legitimacy and the principles of democracy equality and equity among States.The new approach adopted by the internationalcommunity in the process of reform  which covers allUnited Nations structures and fields of activity  offers anopportunity for consolidating the principle of democracy asa basis for international relations. In this connection Tunisia attaches great importance to strengthening the roleand prerogatives of the General Assembly in all the areasof its competence as provided for in the Charter of theUnited Nations  particularly with regard to the developmentand maintenance of international peace and security.We wish to emphasize once again the need torevitalize and enhance the role of the General Assembly given its universality  representativeness and democraticcharacter. Strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency ofthe General Assembly should go hand in hand with thereform of the Security Council so as to confirm theprinciples of transparency  pluralism and democracy. Theseare values which should prevail in international relationsand guide the activities of our Organization and its variousbodies  including the Security Council  in order to enhanceand develop its role in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  which  in recent years  has becomeincreasingly important.Just as we expect the Security Council to acteffectively and to fulfil its mission in the best way possible we also stress the need to give that body a globallyrepresentative character that takes into account the interestsof developing countries and reflects the reality of the worldfollowing the end of the cold war by expanding itsmembership to include all regional groups. In this respect we stress our support for the request of the Group ofAfrican States  reaffirmed at the Ouagadougou summit which calls for the allocation of two permanent seats to beoccupied on a rotational basis by States from Africa  withthe enjoyment of the same privileges as those of thecurrent holders of permanent seats.However  the process of Security Council reformshould not be limited to restructuring that body. Therationalization of the Council’s working methods isneeded so as to strengthen and consolidate one of theCharter’s most important principles  that of compliancewith and respect for international legitimacy by all. In thisconnection  we emphasize the need to review the vetoright  whose use should be confined to the areas coveredby Chapter VII of the Charter.We also believe that the sanctions regime practisedby the Security Council should be reviewed to ensure theprotection of populations  prevent their suffering andguarantee their right to development and to a life ofdignity  and take into account the interests ofneighbouring countries which have economic andcommercial relations with the country targeted forsanctions. A specified time-frame should also be set upfor the implementation and lifting of sanctions. In thisconnection  we stress the necessity of respecting Iraq’ssovereignty and territorial integrity and of implementingthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council  includingthose resolutions dealing with Kuwaiti prisoners andmissing persons.As we pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his efforts to contain the crisis between Iraqand the United Nations Special Commission  we call uponhim to increase his efforts and to undertake the requiredinitiative for a comprehensive review of the situation witha view to finding a solution acceptable to all partieswhich would accelerate the lifting of the sanctionsimposed on the brotherly Iraqi people.Regarding the Lockerbie issue  Tunisia has expressedoptimism over the recent developments  which couldaccelerate the achievement of a just and satisfactorysettlement of this issue  taking into account thewillingness demonstrated by the brotherly country ofLibya and other concerned parties to deal in a positivemanner with the ideas already put forward. We encourageall parties to move ahead in that direction so that theembargo imposed on the brotherly Libyan people can belifted.With respect to the Middle East peace process Tunisia has since the very beginning supported andworked relentlessly for its success. We wish once again21to express our deep concern about the present status of theprocess. We warned that setbacks and deadlocks wouldresult from Israel’s continued policy of fait accompli and itsrefusal to honour its commitments and to implement theagreements that were concluded.We believe that it will not be possible to reach a just comprehensive and lasting solution to the Middle Eastquestion without Israel’s compliance with internationallegitimacy represented by the relevant United Nationsresolutions and based on the principles outlined in theMadrid process  particularly that of “land for peace”.Tunisia  which supports the just Palestinian cause welcomes the resolution adopted by the General Assemblyat its last session enhancing the status of Palestine asobserver at the United Nations. We hope that this step willsoon be followed by international recognition of anindependent Palestinian State with Al-Quds al-Sharif as itscapital.Increased efforts by the international community toconsolidate democratic relations among States and tostrengthen international legitimacy in the conduct of worldaffairs are imperative for the foundation of a balancedinternational order that guarantees a better life for futuregenerations and promotes conditions of stability in thesecurity  economic and social dimensions.With regard to security  many regions of the worldcontinue to be torn by war and conflicts  and theirpopulations still endure suffering and tragedies due to theabsence of stability and security. In our view  the bestsolution to these problems is to pre-empt crises throughpreventive diplomacy so as to eliminate their causes in thefastest and most effective way. The internationalcommunity has successfully adopted this right approach andhas been able to contain a number of conflicts throughmediation  good offices and other peaceful means.The United Nations has also achieved considerablesuccesses in the context of peacekeeping operations inmany parts of the world  enabling it to contain conflictseither by interposing itself between the belligerents or bysupervising the conclusion of peace agreements or byfollowing up on their implementation. In addition  theUnited Nations has intensified cooperation with regionalorganizations within the framework of respect for thenational sovereignty and political independence of States and non-interference in their internal affairs.Nevertheless  these efforts remain insufficient  giventhe challenges that persist in many regions of the world in particular  the African continent. Africa continues toface difficulties and diverse problems which areincreasing its burden and hindering its efforts to achievestability and development.In this respect  Tunisia has welcomed the SecurityCouncil’s initiative regarding the situation in Africa. Webelieve that the Secretary-General’s report in this regardwas well timed  expressing concern about the situationand offering help to the African continent to findsolutions capable of enhancing its security anddevelopment.We hope that this orientation will be confirmed bycontinued United Nations support for the Mechanism forConflict Prevention  Management and Resolution of theOrganization of African Unity through adoption ofpractical measures designed to help the integration ofAfrican States in the world economy.We believe that a lasting peace can be establishedonly through total dismantling weapons of massdestruction  particularly nuclear weapons  whoseformidable arsenals constitute a continued threat tohumanity. It has become clear that the current nuclearnon-proliferation regime cannot by itself eliminate thedanger that the arms race poses to humanity with itsominous implications. Therefore it has become imperativethat the international community increase its efforts toadopt practical measures aiming at eliminating allweapons of mass destruction  without exception  andbanning their proliferation and stockpiling.While working towards that objective  theinternational community should strenuously endeavour toensure the safety of non-nuclear States and to prohibit theuse and the threat of the use of nuclear weapons againstthe sovereignty  territorial integrity and peoples of thoseStates. We also emphasize the need for creating nuclear-weapon-free zones so as to put an end to continuedthreats to the security of countries and to open new vistasfor the establishment of peace  security and stabilitythroughout the world. In this context  Tunisia calls for theurgent creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in theMiddle East  considering that all the countries of theregion except Israel have adhered to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.With regard to conventional weapons  we expressour satisfaction at the signing at Ottawa of the22Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction. Tunisia hastened to sign that Convention believing that an end should be put to the great sufferingthat unarmed civilians are enduring because of theseweapons. Hence  the necessary legal measures are beingtaken for Tunisia’s ratification of the Convention.We believe that peace and security cannot beestablished in the world without achieving economic andsocial development and ensuring conditions of well-beingand dignified living for all peoples.Meeting the major challenges confronting developingcountries starts with the establishment of a world economicorder founded on equality and solidarity so as to enabledeveloping countries to be integrated in the world economyand to attract the required flow of capital and directinvestment needed to support their development efforts.The financial crisis that certain developing countriesare experiencing confirms our belief that the economicglobalization in which we have placed high hopes has despite its positive aspects  negative repercussions on theworld economy  particularly on the stability of theeconomies of developing countries.We call upon the international community and allUnited Nations agencies  in cooperation with the BrettonWoods institutions  to speed up taking the necessarymeasures that will overcome the negative aspects ofglobalization. Therefore  we support the search for effectivemultilateral mechanisms to control international capitalflows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure faircompetition and to organize financial transactions on soundand solid bases. In this context  my country supports theinitiative taken by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countriesto establish a high-level mechanism of consultation betweenthe Movement and the Group of Eight most industrializedcountries.We also believe that in the absence of a radicalsolution to the debt problem  efforts to liberalize theeconomies of developing countries will remain insufficient.In this regard  I would like to recall the proposal made byMr. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali  President of the Republic ofTunisia  with respect to finding a solution to the problem ofexternal debt by applying those debts to the implementationof environmental  social and other priority projects indeveloping countries.Working for the adjustment of the globalizationprocess is not  in our opinion  limited to the pivotal roleplayed by international organizations and financialinstitutions. Increasing efforts at the national and regionallevels are also needed. In this context  Tunisia has strivento make its financial structures more efficient and tostrengthen the factors of sustainable development throughconcentrating on the enhancement of human energies establishing the state of law and institutions  protectinghuman rights and public freedom and strengtheningdemocracy  which is based on the participation of civilsociety with all its components in decision-making.Aware of the importance of economic andgeographic groupings in advancing the economies ofdeveloping countries  promoting man and facing thechallenges of globalization  Tunisia has adopted acomprehensive strategy that reconciles the imperatives ofsecurity and the requirements of cooperation witheconomic complementarity and solidarity among States.That strategy is also based on strengthening the Maghrebarea  establishing partnership with the European Unionthrough the creation of a free trade zone andconsolidating its relations with all countries  particularlythose of Africa.The international conferences which have been heldin recent years  particularly the Vienna World Conferenceon Human Rights  the Beijing Conference on Women andthe Copenhagen World Summit on Social Development have enabled the international community to developcoherent plans of action  addressing many social problemswhich still hinder the progress  the stability and thesecurity of peoples.Tunisia calls for increased efforts to ensure fullimplementation and genuine follow-up of the decisions recommendations and plans of action adopted by thoseconferences and for the necessary measures to applythem.While we recognize the responsibility of States inimplementing economic policies which ensure the right oftheir citizens to development  we also emphasize the needto establish equitable international economic relationswhich take into account the right of all countries particularly developing countries  to comprehensive andsustainable development. We also call upon UnitedNations organs  funds  programmes and specializedagencies to shoulder their responsibilities and helpdeveloping countries carry out their economicprogrammes.23The continued shrinkage of resources allocated forUnited Nations economic and social activities is a matter ofconcern to us. Therefore  we call again for theimplementation of General Assembly resolutions stressingthe need to provide additional funds for development. Wealso urge the international community  and particularly richcountries  to honour their commitments so as to giveimpetus to their efforts in the area of economic and socialdevelopment.The year 1998 marks the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. This coincideswith the start of the evaluation of the follow-up of therecommendations adopted at the Vienna World Conferenceon Human Rights. We believe that the internationalcommunity should take this ideal opportunity to reaffirm itscommitment to promoting and protecting human rights aswell as to develop a clear plan in this regard for the future.Tunisia takes note with satisfaction of the pioneeringrole played by the United Nations in promoting humanrights  a matter which is in the forefront of its priorities  inaccordance with an approach based on a comprehensive andcoherent vision of those rights. Tunisia has contributed tothe formulation of that approach. Nevertheless  we feel thatthese achievements are not enough. Poverty and exclusioncontinue to disrupt social stability in many countries. Theseare phenomena which also threaten the gains made in thefield of human rights and constitute challenges whichshould be met with the required efficiency andeffectiveness. The international community should  in ouropinion  confirm the values of tolerance and disseminatethem as a basic platform for promoting human rights anddeepening the culture of human rights among societiesthroughout the world.We also emphasize that great importance should begiven to the right to development and the need to removeall obstacles to the effective exercise of that right.In implementing its social and economic policy Tunisia has adopted a comprehensive and integratedstrategy aimed at the advancement of human beings. It hasworked to honour all the commitments it has made byadhering to human rights conventions. At the initiative ofthe President of the Republic  many amendments to enactlegislation have been introduced with a view tostrengthening democracy and pluralism  promoting andsafeguarding human rights  disseminating the culture ofhuman rights  strengthening national institutions andmechanisms working in this field and protecting individualand group liberties as well as the rights of women and thechild.In the area of social and economic development Tunisia has increased its efforts to ensure a dignified lifefor members of all social sectors. It has focused its policyin this field on the enhancement of social integration  thestruggle against poverty and the promotion ofemployment for all. In formulating its policy  Tunisia hasbeen eager to involve all components of civil society indefining a comprehensive strategy and in taking necessarymeasures to carry out programmes of economic and socialdevelopment.Social solidarity is one of the pillars of Tunisia’spolicy in combating poverty and all forms of exclusion.The National Solidarity Fund  set up in 1992 at theinitiative of the President of the Republic andsubsequently reinforced by the creation of the TunisianSolidarity Bank  has provided funds for many projects forlow-income groups and has made possible the integrationof underprivileged regions into the national economy.With respect to the consolidation of its employmentpolicy  Tunisia recently formulated a comprehensivestrategy manifested in the adoption of a nationaldeclaration on employment. That declaration was draftedfollowing broad consultations in which all the country’sactive forces took part; this was signed by all of ourpolitical parties  trade unions and professionalassociations.Tunisia’s approach to the formulation andimplementation of its economic and social policy is basedon the conviction that the phenomena of exclusion marginalization and social discrimination create threats tothe very foundations of stability and security  which areessential for the progress and prosperity of peoples. Thestruggle against those phenomena is the most appropriatemeans for eradicating terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations  organized crime and drug-trafficking.In that connection  we once again urge theinternational community to increase its efforts to combatterrorism by setting up a global strategy and taking thenecessary legal measures to contain and uproot thatphenomenon.Increased international awareness of the great dangerof the drug phenomenon  which was illustrated in theconvening of a special session of the General Assemblyin June 1998 on the common struggle against drugs 24encourages us to support the efforts being made by theCommission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice toformulate a draft United Nations framework conventionagainst organized crime. We hope that these efforts willsucceed  for the international community is in urgent needof such an instrument.In the same context  Tunisia welcomes therecommendations of the World Conference of MinistersResponsible for Youth  held recently in Lisbon  and stressesthe need to ensure that the implementation of the decisionstaken at that conference is followed up. This will allow usto deal with the concerns of young people  develop theirsense of responsibility and properly prepare them to assumethe responsibility of managing tomorrow’s world.The Diplomatic Conference held at Rome in June andJuly 1998 on the creation of the International CriminalCourt and the extensive participation of Member States andnon-governmental organizations in that Conference  testifyto the great importance we all accord to the creation ofsuch a court  whose task will be to deal with heinouscrimes against humanity and to punish their perpetrators.Tunisia participated in the Conference and voted infavour of the statute of the Court. While expressingsatisfaction at the agreement reached on the creation ofthe Court  we would like to stress once again theimportance of ensuring its independence and neutrality.Given the need to respect the principle of nationalsovereignty  Tunisia supports the consensus reached onthe complementary character of the jurisdiction of theInternational Criminal Court and on the need to accordpriority to national legal systems  which should retain theinitiative of prosecution.We look forward to the advent of the new centurywith high hopes  and we call upon all States to evaluatewhat we have achieved so as to pursue joint action  toconfront remaining challenges and to spare humanity fromsuffering like that which it has endured throughout thecurrent century. This is a task that requires firm politicalwill from all of us in order to meet the aspirations of ourpeoples to security  stability  growth and cooperation.Our devotion to the principles and purposes of theCharter of the United Nations  the consolidation ofinternational legality and democratic practice amongnations  and the implementation of the process of thereform of the United Nations system to serve thoseprinciples and goals are undoubtedly the best means bywhich to lay the foundations of a better world  a worldwhich we shall shape and build together for futuregenerations."
"166",7003,"TUR",53,1998,"This is my first GeneralAssembly as Prime Minister. I was here as ForeignMinister  when the waves of change were sweeping awaythe cold-war era. I recall the optimism shared by manyabout a more humane and harmonious international system.I remember the sounds of joy as freedom  democracy andthe market economy rang victorious on a global scale.Indeed  significant changes have taken place sincethen. New States have joined the family of nations. Abroader and deeper commitment to contemporary values hastaken root. The international climate long dictated byideological divisions has withered away. At no time inrecent history have nations become so close to each otheraround shared values.Yet this is not the full story. The late twentiethcentury is full of paradoxes and competing currents. For thefortunate among us  the world has never offered more —better education  better health care  greater prosperity. Butthese fruits are denied to the vast majority of the planet?spopulation. The number of people who live in dire povertyis growing.Admittedly  our overall security environment hasimproved. But the resurgence of aggression  extremeethnic nationalism  tribalism  religious fundamentalism racism  xenophobia and cultural discrimination pose newthreats to international peace and stability. Cultural andreligious intolerance is breeding more conflicts than everbefore. International terrorism  openly sponsored by someStates  has become a formidable threat to civilizedsocieties. The interconnected groups that engage interrorism  organized crime and drug-smuggling challengeour security and well-being.The threat of nuclear confrontation between thesuper-Powers has been eliminated; the danger of theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction still loomson the horizon.The two contradictory trends in the world — onetowards fragmentation and conflict  the other towardsglobalization and cooperation — require a careful andsober analysis. This new dialectic defines the frameworkin which we have to operate. The integrity of the nationState  and the demands of an even more interdependentworld must be harmonized and balanced.The United Nations was our collective response tothe challenges of the past. It was built on the ashes of theSecond World War. The bitter experiences of that war lefttheir imprint on the Charter  the rules that govern its workand its structure. To its credit  this Organization hashelped bring peace  prosperity and hope to millions ofpeople around the globe. Indeed  over a span of 53 yearsthe United Nations has managed very complexhumanitarian emergencies  from civil wars to the massmovement of refugees and health epidemics. For millionsof people around the world  the United Nations is not afaceless institution. It is the difference between peace andwar. It is food for those on the borderline of starvationand medicine to those on the brink of death. But  aboveall  the United Nations remains our hope for a better peaceful and secure future.In this time of challenge and change  the UnitedNations is more important than ever. It is here at theUnited Nations that we must fight together against theforces of destruction. It is here that we must strive tostrengthen democratic institutions  to further promote andprotect all human rights and fundamental freedoms  andto punish those responsible for crimes against humanity.It is here that we must open the door to developmentfor many nations trapped in poverty. Their misery is a24challenge to all of us. But  above all  the United Nationsmust promote justice so that peace may endure.As we stand at the threshold of a new millennium  itis our duty to chart a new course for the United Nationsand set a common standard for the behaviour of nations.I suggest that we should focus greater effort on thefollowing areas.The first is preventing conflicts in potential crisisareas. I believe there is no shortage of information on abrewing crisis. By the time a crisis is addressed at theUnited Nations  it has already taken on critical proportionsand often reached a point of no return. Bosnia is the mosttragic example. Regional organizations should play a moreeffective role in defusing tensions from their onset.Regional organizations and the United Nations shouldestablish an effective mechanism for coordination andconsultation.The second area is peace-building. We must devise anew approach to peace-building to provide lasting security.Even when a ceasefire is holding or elections have takenplace  the social and institutional grounds appear to be veryshaky. The United Nations must have both a programmeand experts to help countries emerge from conflicts.The third area is sustainable development. If theUnited Nations is to maintain its credibility for itsMembers  it must enable people to lift themselves out ofpoverty. There must be more effective coordination betweenUnited Nations aid  international efforts and contributionsfrom donor countries. Obviously  funding is a majorconcern  but a coordinated and streamlined strategy isequally important.The emphasis recently placed by the United Nationson the problems of Africa is an encouraging starting point.It should give direction to our efforts to eliminate povertyin all regions where we witness human misery.The fourth area is one standard for all. Despite allsolemn declarations  international conventions and the legalframework  there seems to be no end in sight todiscriminatory practices and double standards. The divisionof the world along religious  ethnic and cultural fault linesis an invitation to disaster. We must all ensure that nonation in the world feels discriminated against on thegrounds of its cultural or religious identity.My final point pertains to the fight against terrorism.We have to eliminate this major threat to our citizens andnations. I share the views expressed by President Clinton.We have to place the combat against terrorism at the topof our agenda. There must be no excuses  no falsejustifications.The demands on the United Nations have grownenormously. We all agree that reform is vital. We supportthe Secretary-General in his substantive reforms. Webelieve that reform must be comprehensive. It must alsoinclude the reform of the Security Council. Piecemealefforts and inadequate measures do not offer a solution.The representative character of the Security Council mustbe enhanced to meet the expectations of the largestsegment of the United Nations membership. The Councilmust become more responsive and transparent. Reformmust render this organ more accountable  effective anddemocratic  so that it can exercise authority and offermoral guidance.Turkish foreign policy is defined by a blend of ourhistory  culture and geostrategic location at the crossroadsof Asia and Europe. It corresponds to the aspirations ofour people for peace  stability and prosperity. As a seculardemocratic country with a predominantly Muslimpopulation  we combine our national heritage with astrong commitment to modernism.On all the issues and disputes that figure on theagenda of the international community  our policies areclear and consistent. We oppose aggression and believethat any breach of international law and legitimacy mustnot be condoned. We have always advocated theresolution of disputes through peaceful means anddialogue. Turkey has been an active actor in the efforts tocontribute to the peaceful settlement of outstandingdisputes. We participate extensively in peacekeeping andpeace enforcement operations.We live in a region where there are major currentsof instability and conflict. Indeed  almost every majorissue that consumes the international community — fromthe Balkans to the Caucasus  from the Middle East to theGulf — affects our security and well-being. Conscious ofthese challenges  we have assumed an important role incontributing to the efforts aimed at peacefully resolvingconflicts and preserving security and stability. We areactively promoting regional peace through regionalcooperation initiatives. Both the Black Sea EconomicCooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organizationare cases in point.25The Balkan region is a test case with regard to thechallenges we face in the post-cold-war era. It is here thatwe must prove that multicultural and multi-ethnic societieshave a chance to live in peace and harmony. We thoughtthat we had all drawn our bitter lessons from the tragedy ofBosnia and Herzegovina. We must never allow it to happenagain.However  the recent violence in Kosovo is similar towhat transpired in Bosnia and Herzegovina; it is of thesame making  the result of the same mentality. Within theterritorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Kosovo must regain its autonomous status in a manner thatsatisfies all the ethnic groups.Regional stability is a prerequisite for internationalpeace. That is why we have taken a number of initiativesto resolve outstanding problems with some of ourneighbours. A problem that has preoccupied Turkish-Bulgarian relations for almost half a century has recentlybeen resolved successfully in good faith by the twocountries. This achievement demonstrates vividly that eventhe most complex issues can be resolved if there is politicalwill and courage on both sides.Several interrelated problems  mostly pertaining to theAegean and inherited from the past  continue to marTurkish-Greek relations. It is our ardent hope that thesequestions will be addressed between the two countriesthrough a meaningful dialogue  without excluding anyUnited Nations-agreed method of peaceful settlement. Wecall upon the Government of Greece to dedicate itself to adialogue with Turkey.The question of Cyprus is at a critical juncture. Thecourse pursued by Greece and the Greek Cypriots poses aserious threat to the security of the Turkish Republic ofNorthern Cyprus and of Turkey. It is also detrimental topeace and stability in the eastern Mediterranean.On the military front  the policies of the Greek/GreekCypriot camp have heightened tensions on the island. Theclock is ticking for the deployment of the S-300 missilesystem.On the political front  the decision of the EuropeanUnion to start accession negotiations with the GreekCypriot side has altered all the parameters and theestablished framework for a settlement. Regrettably  thisprocess serves only to perpetuate the division of the island.Turkey fully supports the initiative tabled at thiscritical time by President Denktas¸ on 31 August 1998.This proposal of historic importance foresees theestablishment of a Cyprus confederation. We believe thisproposal provides a perspective for a just and lastingsettlement. It corresponds to the realities of the island. Itprotects the vital and legitimate interests of all the partiesconcerned. It aims at preserving the integrity of theisland. It is in line with the United Nations approach toreaching a freely negotiated and mutually acceptablesettlement to the Cyprus issue.We believe that the proposed confederation canfinally open an avenue for peace and reconciliation basedon a common destiny for the two peoples in Cyprus.The impasse in the Middle East peace process andthe continuing plight of the Palestinian people are asource of great concern for Turkey. An incomplete peaceexposes the Middle East to the risks of further instability.It also dims the prospects for the people of the region toenjoy an economically and socially sound future.Turkey is a friend of the Arab nations. We share acommon history and a rich cultural heritage. We valuethese strong bonds. Turkey is also a friend of Israel. Weare  therefore  all the more concerned by the lack ofprogress in bringing a permanent state of peace andstability to the Middle East.In the same vein  we look forward to thereintegration into the international community of Iraq with its territorial integrity intact  through the fullimplementation of the Security Council resolutions andthe lifting of the sanctions.The crisis in Afghanistan also threatens peace andstability within the wider context of the region. TheAfghan conflict can only be overcome through inter-Afghan dialogue and the establishment of a broad-basedGovernment. The United Nations should have a centralrole in this regard.The overall situation in the Caucasus is a majordestabilizing factor. It has a direct bearing on our securityand well-being. We call for the urgent settlement of theNagorny Karabakh dispute and the termination of theArmenian occupation of Azeri territory. The Armenianleadership must commit itself to the efforts of the MinskGroup of the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe. It is our sincere conviction that the interests of26the Armenian people will be better served by focusing ona peaceful future  rather than militancy.Peace and stability in the Caucasus also require theresolution of the Georgian/Abkhaz conflict  with full respectfor the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.Azerbaijan  Armenia and Georgia are our neighbours with which we wish to work together for our commonprosperity and security.At the threshold of a new millennium  our agenda forthe twenty-first century must be inspired by the vision ofthe founding fathers. We must rededicate ourselves to thepurposes and principles of the Charter. We must fulfil ourpledge to succeeding generations. To this end  we must joinour forces to maintain international peace and security.Turkey  for its part  is prepared to assume its share asan actor in the preservation of international peace  securityand prosperity. In fact  I would like to take this opportunityto state from this rostrum that we are a serious contenderfor the Security Council in the year 2000. Turkey is eagerto place its assets at the service of regional and globalpeace and stability as a member of the Council.The Charter is a contract among nations to combineour efforts to realize the aspirations and goals of thepeoples of the world. It is high time that we fulfilled itsterms. It is also time to build on the progress we have madefor the cause of peace  security and prosperity of the globalcommunity. We must now give a new direction to ourefforts. As the world turns a new leaf  let us rise to theoccasion."
"167",7065,"TZA",53,1998,"Onbehalf of the delegation of the United Republic ofTanzania  and on my own behalf  allow me to extend toMr. Didier Opertti our sincere congratulations on hisunanimous election as President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-third session. To his predecessor  Mr. HennadiyUdovenko  I should like to convey our deep appreciationfor the exemplary manner in which he presided over thelast session.My delegation also wishes to take this opportunity tocommend the Secretary-General for the dedication he hasdemonstrated in guiding our Organization through one of itsmost challenging periods  as we seek to reform andrevitalize it and to restore its focus on the economic  socialand development agenda — the very heart of its mission.The reform of the United Nations is a course we haveset for ourselves. Indeed  the reform we desire cannot be anend in itself; rather  it is a means to better enable ourOrganization to carry out its mission efficiently and moreeffectively. Therefore  our efforts must be directed not onlyat placing the development problems we face on the globalagenda  but also at strengthening the concrete contributionof the United Nations in the development field and resistingany attempts at withdrawal in this area. For it is in the areaof development that the challenge to the United Nations ismost critical  and it is for this reason that we believe theOrganization should continue to be involved  and its role bestrengthened.My delegation strongly shares the general desire ofMember States to strengthen the role of the SecurityCouncil  as well as to review its composition. We alsoshare disappointment about the degree of progress we havebeen able to achieve so far. However  progress on thismatter can only be made after we reach agreement on thefundamental principles involved and how we can movetogether in the direction of implementing that agreement.Tanzania  and indeed Africa  has made its positionclear: that we desire an expanded  representative anddemocratized Security Council in which each Member isgiven a rightful role to play. Africa  as the largest group demands and deserves no fewer than two permanent seatsin an appropriately expanded Council. At the moment  wemust place the emphasis on reaching agreement on theprinciple and extent of expanding the Council  and notelsewhere.An effective United Nations is a matter of as muchgreat concern to my country as it is to all Member States.The effectiveness of our Organization depends  to aconsiderable extent  on its being financially stable. It issad that the financial situation of our Organization hasbecome increasingly precarious. Cash balances continueto be dangerously low  the timing and amount of inflowscontinue to be unpredictable  and the Organization isunable to meet its commitments on time. In other words a bad financial situation has persisted and becomeincreasingly rigid. We are all aware of the fact that thisdifficult financial situation has been brought about and isbeing exacerbated by the non-payment of outstandingassessed contributions on the part of some MemberStates  especially the major contributor  for reasons ofpolitical expediency. We urge them to pay on time  in fulland without qualification.On 7 August this year  the American embassy in mycountry was the target of a terrorist bombing deliberatelyplanned and callously executed to cause maximumdamage. The attack in Dar-es-Salaam  Tanzania  claimedthe lives of 10 innocent and unsuspecting Tanzanians injured over 70 people and caused extensive damage toproperty. A similar and almost simultaneous bombing ofthe American embassy in Nairobi  Kenya  brought aboutfar greater loss of life and destruction of property.In the wake of the attack  many friends here sent usmessages of condolence and solidarity. Some of themextended financial and material support to help us meetthe requirements of treating the victims of the bombing as well as to help with the investigations. I would like toreiterate the gratitude of the people and Government ofTanzania to all those Governments  organizations andindividuals who have expressed solidarity with us orextended material support following that tragic terroristbombing. Of particular mention here are the people andGovernment of the United States of America  whoextended medical support and assisted in theinvestigations through the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI).Terrorism is a heinous crime against humanity. It iscruel  indiscriminate and  above all  wanton and senseless.Whatever cause may have prompted the perpetrators toresort to it  we do not believe that it is any wayjustifiable. It is the most rational way neither of4expressing one’s indignation  nor of dealing with one’s socalled enemy. Instead  from the moral and politicalstandpoint  acts of terrorism lead to the alienation of theperpetrators  incite hatred and so  deservedly  earn themoutrage and condemnation. Invariably  terrorism reduces thenumber of sympathizers and adds to the list of opponents.It is a worthless recourse — indeed  a misadventure whichcommon sense demands to be abandoned now.The bombings brought home a number of realities namely  that terrorism is a global problem and that nocountry is safe from its menace. It also reminded us that just as terrorism has a global reach  so must the fightagainst it be concerted and global. The world musttherefore make it quite clear to the perpetrators of theseheinous crimes that terrorism will be answered with swiftand decisive action to bring those responsible to justice andthat they will find no solace or refuge anywhere.Thanks to international cooperation and partnership the investigations into those terrorist bombings are oncourse and arrests have been made. In fact  two peoplehave already appeared in court in Dar-es-Salaam  Tanzania charged with committing acts of terrorism and murder thanks to cooperation between Tanzanian investigators  theFBI and several other countries and organizations. We needto strengthen that cooperation in order to bring all of thoseresponsible to justice and ensure that terrorism iscomprehensively dealt with. In this regard  we shouldstrengthen international legal regimes against terrorism.Three months ago in June  world leaders met here inNew York and addressed the world drug problem  anotherinternational criminal question which deserves globalaction. The objective was to commit themselves to fightingthe demand for illicit drugs  the manufacture ofpsychotropic substances and the diversion of precursorswithin precise time-frames. The Political Declaration andthe Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug DemandReduction that world leaders adopted at the end of thespecial session were the first agreements ever aimedexclusively at examining individual and collective problemsarising from drug abuse. Just like terrorism  drugs are aninternational menace which must be dealt with throughglobal cooperation and partnership.On 12 December this year  we shall be celebrating thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration on HumanRights  which was adopted by the General Assembly on 10December 1948. The celebration of the fiftieth anniversaryis a fitting occasion for all of us to look critically at ourrecord in the protection and promotion of human rights.This is the time for us to ask ourselves whether ouradherence to human rights agreements has made anydifference to the way we observe human rights. This isthe time for us to renew our commitment to allinternational instruments to which we are party byimplementing the provisions of those agreements.I wish I could preface my remarks on the GreatLakes region on a more positive note than I did last year.The situation in Burundi remains precarious notwithstanding the holding of the negotiating processwithin the framework of the Arusha peace talks. Wecontinue to receive refugees from Burundi  as the securitysituation inside the country has not improved appreciably.Yet  we are encouraged that the parties to the conflictcontinue to demonstrate the disposition to a pacificsettlement and persist in dialogue. In a couple of weeks a further round of negotiations will convene in Arusha under the facilitation of Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere  tothrash out the details of a settlement and strengthen theundertakings already entered into during the last round oftalks.We will continue to urge the parties to the conflictin Burundi along the path of dialogue in the fullknowledge that Tanzania and  indeed  the region can onlyhelp. The onus of delivering peace and sustaining it restssquarely and solely on the people that country.The situation in the Democratic Republic of theCongo is very worrisome indeed. The conflict there  inboth its internal and external contexts  threatens to throwthat country and the region into prolonged anarchy andwar unless it is arrested now. The region  particularlywithin the framework of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) and the Organizationof African Unity (OAU)  has expended efforts aimed atsecuring a ceasefire in order to initiate a political processto bring the conflict to a peaceful end. This was the spiritof the Victoria Falls and Pretoria summits  as well as ofthe SADC summit in Mauritius only a couple of weeksago. We are also appreciative of the efforts deployed bySecretary-General Kofi Annan during the Non-Alignedsummit in Durban  South Africa  in the search for aspeedy end to the hostilities and the beginning of aprocess of dialogue and negotiation.My Government believes that anarchy and war in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo are not inevitable.They can be avoided provided all the parties demonstratea sense of realism and a willingness to work on acomprehensive settlement based on scrupulous respect for5the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country; theprinciple of a peaceful settlement of the conflict; fullrespect for the rights of all the citizens of that country; andthe consideration of the legitimate security concerns of theneighbouring countries.My country will therefore continue  within thisframework and in the context of the mandate given to it bythe SADC summit meeting which took place in Mauritiusrecently  to urge all the parties involved to bring animmediate end to the hostilities and to facilitate thecommencement of negotiations aimed at securing anunderstanding on the ceasefire and its monitoring  troopwithdrawals and the internal dialogue  which is so criticalto the long-term security  peace  stability and unity of thatcountry. I urge the international community to support theregional efforts now under way to avert catastrophe in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.My delegation is equally concerned about the EritreaEthiopia border conflict  which has brought these two sisterrepublics and fraternal peoples into a war which has alreadyclaimed many lives and huge damage to property. Wecontinue to urge the two countries to exercise restraint andconsider initiatives  particularly those of the OAU  aimed atdiffusing tension and finding a peaceful solution to theborder conflict.These two countries  which have endured decades ofconflict  know the destruction and pain which war canengender  and they owe it to themselves and to peace inAfrica to ensure that nothing is done to aggravate thesituation and reignite military confrontation. We also urgethem to give mediation a chance. After all  it is in dialoguethat both sides of the argument can be heard  and it is indialogue that mechanisms for enduring peace can benegotiated and put in place.The instability in the Great Lakes area continues to bethe source of refugees in the region. Tanzania has hostedthousands of them  and it seems we will continue to do sobecause of the deterioration of the political situation insome countries. The exercise to repatriate refugees from theDemocratic Republic of the Congo began in October lastyear and was proceeding well. By June this year  48 658Congolese refugees had been repatriated. There were47 857 remaining  but the repatriation programme wasgoing well.However  with the outbreak of civil strife in theCongo  the exercise has stalled and new refugees are onceagain streaming into Tanzania. In the two months of thenew conflict in that country  we have already receivedabout 10 000 new refugees. As part of the internationalcommunity and a responsible member of the UnitedNations  Tanzania will continue to meet its internationalobligation of hosting these refugees  and about 200 000refugees more from Burundi. But we must confess thatbecause of various circumstances  our perseverance iswearing out and our hospitality should not be consideredopen-ended.While appealing for increased support and assistancefor our country for hosting refugees  we call upon theinternational community to exert great efforts to deal withthe root cause of the refugee problem. Many times beforein this Assembly and other forums  the internationalcommunity has spoken of and committed itself to helpingthe refugee-producing countries address the root cause ofthe displacements. I regret that this has remained anunfulfilled intention. I always wonder why there has beenso much talk about it and little is being achieved.Today  we see latent reluctance to engage thosecountries in sustained political dialogue requiring them totake responsibility for their refugee-generating policies.We see greater preparedness to rationalize their actions inthe name of humanitarianism. At times the host countryhas been the object of undue pressure to make moreconcessions or even of unjustified blame and accusations.It is very frustrating indeed. This is not the way to assistrefugee-producing countries to come to terms with theirinternal problems and spare others the unending burden ofhosting refugees. We need to emphasize the closure ofthose factories which produce refugees  as we do meetingthe needs of those innocent refugees who are theproducts.It is in this light that I ask the Assembly and theinternational community to encourage the countries of theGreat Lakes to resolve the underlying political conflictsof the region and to call for mechanisms for greaterburden-sharing in a way that will ease strain on theresources of the countries which have borne the brunt ofhosting refugees.The peace process in Angola is  to our utmost regret moving dangerously towards collapse. While the LusakaProtocol may still be salvaged  we strongly condemnUNITA for its blatant violations of both the agreementand relevant Security Council resolutions. The people ofAngola need and deserve the peace they have beenwaiting for for so long. The international community musthold UNITA and its leadership responsible for their6failure to fully implement their obligations under the PeaceAccords  thus frustrating the successful outcome of thepeace process. Tanzania will support any efforts by thisAssembly which will ensure that peace obtains in Angola.The search for a peaceful settlement in Somalia hasnot borne fruit yet. The country remains divided intosectors  each held by a warlord. We support the efforts ofthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) within the terms of the Sodore agreement  as well as thoseof the OAU Chairman and Secretary-General  in searchingfor a solution in Somalia. We support the efforts to hold aconsultative meeting to bring together various groups ofpeople  including individuals  businessmen and communitygroups  in order to get views and proposals in addition tothose of political parties.Another long-standing issue is the question of WesternSahara. We hope that the referendum will go ahead asplanned on 7 December of this year. Tanzania calls on theUnited Nations to ensure that the preparations are wellexecuted so that justice will prevail  especially in decidingwho should vote in the referendum.We regret that the situation in the Middle Eastcontinues to be characterized by tension and continueddenial to the Palestinian people of their right to full selfdetermination and to a homeland of their own  due to therefusal by Israel to honour its obligations towards the peaceprocess. The Israeli policy of territorial expansion  in utterviolation of the letter and spirit of those commitments stands to undermine the prospects for the permanent statusnegotiations leading to agreement for peace in the area. Wecall upon the Israeli Government to abandon itsobstructionist policies and to resume dialogue. In thisregard  my Government is encouraged by the high-levelconsultations which are currently taking place between theleaders of Palestine and Israel. We hope they will lead toovercoming the present impasse in the peace process.My delegation has welcomed the recent breakthroughin the long-standing conflict between the Libyan ArabJamahiriya on the one hand  and the United States and theUnited Kingdom on the other  over the Lockerbie incident which culminated in the adoption of Security Councilresolution 1192 (1998). It remains our fervent hope thatagreement will be reached soon on the trial arrangements sothat the sanctions imposed upon Libya can be quicklylifted.The Korean Peninsula remains an area of tension andunpredictability. We continue to believe that durable peaceand eventual unification can be attained only throughdialogue. We therefore urge the parties and theinternational community to support this course.We welcome the agreement reached between theGovernments of Portugal and Indonesia to address thequestion of East Timor. We urge the two Governments toexpand the dialogue they have initiated so that the wishesof the East Timorese people can be fulfilled.Africa is faced by a number of devastating conflicts.It accepts the primary responsibility for bringing them toan end and for elaborating mechanisms for enduringpeace in the continent. It is in fulfilment of thatresponsibility that the OAU has taken a leading role insearching for solutions. This the organization has done inpartnership with its subregional groups of countries andorganizations  as was the case with Liberia  Sierra Leoneand now in Burundi  Somalia  the Comoros and Lesotho among others. My Government continues to believe in thecentrality of the OAU in the search for solutions toAfrican problems. At the same time  we also believe thatwhere necessary  the OAU and the African continentdeserve the support of the international community and ofthe United Nations in particular.In this regard  once again wish to pay tribute to theSecurity Council for the initiative it took a year ago inhaving a regular ministerial debate on Africa  the result ofwhich was the report of the Secretary-General on thecauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace andsustainable development in Africa. We applauded theSecretary-General for that report and we do so againtoday. We could not agree more with his observation that“it is the persistence of poverty that is impeding thefull promise of peace for all of Africa’s peoples. Thealleviation of poverty must be the first aim of ourefforts. Only then — only when prosperity andopportunity become real — will every citizen  youngor old  man or woman  have a genuine and lastingstake in a peaceful future for Africa — politically economically and socially.”Indeed  our illustrious Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  has underscored two important facts here. One that a poor man  a hungry man  has no peace. Two  onlywhen prosperity and opportunity become real will Africatake its rightful place in the global economy. Africans more than anyone else  recognize that they bear theresponsibility to move towards that noble objective. Theyneed the support of the international community.The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda which my country is privileged to host  has been workingunder challenging circumstances. During the past 12 monthsit has made commendable progress. Regrettably  moreattention has been attracted by the difficulties it has had toconfront than what it has achieved. My Governmentremains strongly committed to supporting the Tribunal. Weare also keenly aware that  just as we have to play our part the international community must also lend its firm supportto the Tribunal to enable it to discharge its mandate andassist  as quickly as it should  in the healing process inRwanda. The recent judgements by the Tribunal constitutea milestone towards that end. They are a landmark weshould welcome and build on.The adoption in Rome of the Statute for theInternational Criminal Court is a welcome step towardsbridging a critical gap in both international criminal lawand international humanitarian and human rights law. Mydelegation believes that the establishment of the Court willbe a concrete assurance of our profound concern aboutrespect for and protection of the humanity we all share. Itrepresents an important assurance that individuals  whetheras leaders or otherwise  will be accountable and thereforethat impunity will not go unpunished. Indeed  theestablishment of the Court will be a legacy of ourcommitment to the pursuit of justice  and could well godown as one of the most momentous decisions of thetwentieth century.It is in the context of the pursuit of justice that wemust  however  mention what in our view is the mostserious failure of the Rome Conference. At a time whensome financial institutions are making  albeit belatedly some form of reparation to the victims of the NaziHolocaust  it is to be regretted that the attribution of someform of criminal responsibility to legal persons is a notionconspicuously absent from the Statute. To the extent thatthis was driven by considerations of corporate interest  itspeaks about our lack of real commitment to justice notwithstanding any measure of concern and grief we maypretend to extend to victims.Disarmament continues to be an important issue formy country. The Treaty of Pelindaba establishing a nuclearweapon-free zone in Africa is testament to the resolve ofAfrica to pursue the cause of nuclear disarmament. Whileit is easy to take exception to the recent events in SouthAsia  we are keenly aware that international responsesremain the sole alternative in determining a preferablecourse of action. We remain convinced that the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is avaluable international instrument for nuclear disarmament.In the end  the only viable alternative for internationalpeace continues to be a commitment by all States to atotal and comprehensive nuclear disarmament.The Assembly is meeting against the background ofa deteriorating international economic situation broughtabout by the persistence of old problems and theemergence of new ones. The situation has beencompounded by the challenges of adjusting to a rapidlyliberalizing and globalizing world economy.The majority of humankind resides in developingcountries  and Africa is the least developed of thecontinents. It is in this regard that my delegation isconcerned that after a three-year period of positiveeconomic growth  Africa’s economic performanceslackened last year  thus demonstrating once again thefragility of the recovery process in our region. Acombination of factors  including unpredictable weatherconditions  lack of financial resources and poorinfrastructure and technology  continue to adversely affectproduction performances and therefore pose a majorconstraint on efforts towards recovery  growth andsustainable development.Trade plays a crucial role in the economicdevelopment of any country. Despite the slowdown inproduction by African countries  the volume of theirexports has increased over time. In 1997  for example Africa’s volume of trade increased by 8 per cent  therebyraising the continent’s total revenue from trade by 5.9 percent. However  it is sad to point out that despite all itsefforts  Africa’s contribution to world trade remains verysmall and is actually decreasing. Limited access tomarkets  high tariffs  low commodity prices and lowoutput deny African countries the benefits of the twinprocess of globalization and trade liberalization. This isunjust  because many of these countries are painfullyundertaking major reforms aimed at diversifying theireconomies. There is therefore an urgent need to addressthis problem if African countries are to be assisted toincrease their participation in global trade. Failure to doso would mean that Africa will continue to bemarginalized and will stand to benefit little from therecent years’ economic growth and global integration.Tanzania calls for the establishment of an equitable secure  non-discriminatory and predictable multilateraltrading system that would enhance the trade development8possibilities of African countries  and especially of the leastdeveloped among us.The question of sustainable development of Africancountries also continues to be seriously affected by theheavy debt burden these countries endure. Tanzania isamong such affected countries  and is currently spendingalmost one third of its revenue to pay its external debt which has now reached a disproportionate rate. My countryis currently implementing various debt managementprogrammes to reduce the effects of the debt onGovernment operations. Despite the resource constraint  myGovernment has set as a top priority the repayment of itsforeign debt  while continuing to negotiate with ourcreditors on the possibility of rescheduling and/or cancellingsome of its debt.Tanzania believes that the establishment by the WorldBank and the International Monetary Fund of the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries Initiative is a step in the rightdirection in this endeavour. However  as we have hadoccasion to state in the past  we are concerned about theconditionalities associated with this initiative. A way outhas to be found to ensure that the criteria are made moreobjective so that as many least developed countries aspossible benefit from this otherwise important initiative.What could be a more objective criterion for eligibilityunder the Initiative than poverty itself? In the same manner we support the call for the holding of an internationalconference on money and finance.On the eve of the new millennium  Tanzania noteswith regret that poverty levels remain very high  despite theobservance of the International Year for the Eradication ofPoverty two years ago. This is unacceptable  and it is notsustainable in the long run.While those who have more can decide to turn a blindeye or ignore our calls to look for a solution to this humantragedy  it cannot be overemphasized that poverty is theroot cause of many problems that cut across the boundariesbetween rich and poor. The interconnectedness of the worldleaves no country insulated from the problems of others.Indeed  even if not in the same sense  the recent financialcrisis in Asia and its global ramifications serves to illustratethis fact.It has been argued that foreign direct investment ismore effective in bringing about development than officialdevelopment assistance. This could be so  but mydelegation is concerned that private capital flows are goingonly to a few selected countries. This leaves the majority ofthe poor developing countries little hope of extricatingthemselves from the poverty trap.Official development assistance is still an importantfactor in assisting developing countries in their efforts toupgrade infrastructure  which is necessary to attract directforeign investment. It is unrealistic  therefore  to expectthis enormous cost to be met by private capital ordomestic savings alone. We therefore urge the developedcountries to arrest the trend of diminishing officialdevelopment assistance and fulfil the official developmentassistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product.We would like to thank those partners that have reachedthe official development assistance target of 0.7 per centof gross national product. Others should emulate theexample they have set.Tanzania attaches great importance to South-Southcooperation as a means of attaining collective self-relianceand complementing international developmentcooperation. In this regard  my country will continue towork very closely with other developing countries for therealization of this goal  for we believe that this is the bestway for countries of the South to integrate themselvesinto the global economy.My delegation urges the international donorcommunity to extend its support to the South-Southcooperation arrangements initiated by the developingcountries. In particular  countries of the South wish to beassisted in developing capacities in science andtechnology that are suitable for local conditions.We call on the United Nations system to continueassisting countries of the South  and in particular the leastdeveloped ones  to mobilize the necessary resources toenable them to enter the twenty-first century of scienceand technology with confidence.Before concluding my statement  I would like toextend our condolences and sympathy to the Governmentand people of the many Caribbean island nations  as wellas the United States  who have been and continue to bedevastated by Hurricane Georges. Our hearts go outparticularly to the people of Cuba  the DominicanRepublic  Haiti and Puerto Rico  who have suffered themost devastation.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate our strong belief inand commitment to the United Nations and its aspirationsand the principles of the Charter. However  we areconscious of the fact that the strength  or otherwise  of the9United Nations will stem from the moral and materialsupport rendered by its Members. This is the challenge weall have to pursue ceaselessly in the interests ofinternational peace and security and for the equitabledevelopment of humanity."
"168",7108,"UGA",53,1998,"At the outset  I wish toconvey the apologies of President Yoweri KagutaMuseveni  who was supposed to address the Assembly. Heis unable to come to New York because of other pressingState duties.Allow me  on behalf of my delegation  to conveyour warm congratulations to you  Sir  on your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-thirdsession. Let me pay a special tribute to your predecessor Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine  for the excellentmanner in which he presided over the work of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly. I wish also tothank the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for all theendeavours he is undertaking in shaping our Organizationto enable it to effectively meet the challenges of the nextmillennium.The United Nations has been at the forefront ofefforts to tackle problems of international peace andsecurity and social and economic development. It hashelped many communities around the world attain peace greater security and higher standards of living. Africafaces a number of challenges which must be urgentlyaddressed. It is a volatile region in which a multiplicity ofconflicts have combined to create a very explosiveatmosphere. Refugee populations have multiplied toprovide a further recipe for future instability. Thesituation has been further complicated by large numbersof internally displaced people. Indeed  a large politicaland humanitarian tragedy is taking place in the region.There is therefore an urgent need for the internationalcommunity to support Africa?s efforts to address thefundamental causes of the conflict.It has been alleged that ethnic differences are theprime causes of conflict in the region. My delegation doesnot share this view. We believe that poor leadership poverty and low levels of economic development in theregion are the main underlying causes. The leadership inour region must correctly define and analyse the rootcauses of the problems and establish clear priorities. It isalso imperative that  for a permanent and durable peaceto prevail in the region  a comprehensive programme ofeconomic recovery and development be implemented inAfrica. Concerted efforts must therefore be made toreduce and ultimately eradicate poverty in the world.In this regard  Uganda had the honour of hosting aleaders? forum in Kampala in January this year at whichthe heads of State and Government of countries in theeastern  southern and central regions of Africa met andheld discussions with the President of the World Bank.That meeting  which in many ways was unique andinspiring  opened a new chapter in Africa?s relations with18the Bank. It ushered in a genuine spirit of partnershipbetween Africa and the Bank. Two of the significantoutcomes of the meeting were  first  the decision that Africawould be considered a priority development region by theWorld Bank and  secondly  a commitment to depoliticizeforeign aid. It was also agreed at the meeting that Africancountries must set their own priorities for development. Itis the hope of my delegation that the agreements reached atthe Kampala leaders? forum will be translated into concreteaction by the international community in the near future.We believe that similar initiatives could be undertakentogether with other organs of the United Nations system.For too long  international efforts have been expendedon short-term humanitarian programmes  ignoring the long-term requirements for sustainable peace and development.Past experience has shown that this approach cannot ensuredurable peace and development. Indeed  as the Secretary-General noted in his report on the causes of conflict and thepromotion of durable peace and sustainable development inAfrica “Preventing such wars is no longer a matter ofdefending States or protecting allies. It is a matter ofdefending humanity”. (A/52/871  para. 3)Conflict prevention  including post-conflict peace-building  requires a sustained effort to infuse funds into theregion. In this regard  we urge serious consideration andexpeditious implementation of the recommendationscontained in the Secretary-General?s report.The massive cuts in social spending and publicinvestments  with the attendant high levels ofunemployment  create new centres of discontent and thusfurther fuel the embers of conflict. Attempts to imposeconditionalities which are antithetical to the peace processand the cutting off of aid from weak Governments makingsincere efforts to pursue reconciliation or implement peaceagreements have been counterproductive. My delegationwould wish to argue for “peace-friendly” structuraladjustment programmes  if durable peace and sustainabledevelopment are to be achieved in Africa and elsewhere.A number of delegations have expressed their viewson the situation in the Great Lakes region with specificreference to the ongoing crisis in the Democratic Republicof the Congo. My country was specifically accused ofinvolvement in the crisis in the Democratic Republic of theCongo. The facts of the situation in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo are not clear to some member Statesof this Assembly. Since  many speakers have raised thisissue  we would like to make the following clarifications.Uganda?s interest in the situation in the Great Lakesregion has always been and is still based on thefollowing: the need to ensure total security in all parts ofUganda and the protection of the lives and property of thepeople of Uganda; and the desire to ensure maximumstability in the Great Lakes region  because instability inany neighbouring country directly affects our security andeconomy.These concerns are legitimate. Our position on thiscrisis therefore reflects our efforts to pursue thoseinterests. Before the fall of former President Mobutu  itwas not possible for Uganda to get cooperation from thethen Government in Zaire to ensure that Zairian territorywas not used by terrorist organizations to create insecurityalong the Uganda-Zaire border and inside Uganda.When President Laurent Kabila came to power itwas mutually agreed between Uganda and the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo that our two armies would jointlyoperate in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo to contain and eventually remove the banditswho were using the bases they had in the area todestabilize Uganda. Pursuant to that understanding Uganda has since maintained a military presence in theeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  inaccordance with the provision of the bilateral agreementbetween our two countries. The situation in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo today necessitates thatUganda must maintain that military presence  which iscrucial for the security of our country and our people.Let me make it clear to all and sundry that Ugandahas no territorial designs on the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo. It is not the primary responsibility of Ugandato dictate the political arrangements of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. However  any internalarrangement in the Democratic Republic of the Congowhich does not take into account the legitimate securityconcerns of its neighbours is our concern. We would liketo say that unilateral military intervention by individualcountries or sectional intervention by groups of countriesis unacceptable. These actions are likely to escalate theproblem. If there are good reasons for an intervention  itshould be regional  carried out  for example  through theSouthern African Development Community (SADC)  theCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa(COMESA)  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) or19even the United Nations  and in the context of the peaceinitiatives that are already in place.We would therefore like to stress that there are seriousregional efforts to address the situation in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. We believe these efforts should besupported by the entire membership of this Organizationand by all parties that are interested in the conflict and havea vested interest in peace and security in the Great Lakesregion.Uganda?s commitment to the full respect for anduniversal enjoyment of human rights is well known.However  we regret that crimes are now being committedon a daily basis against the people of Uganda by surrogateforces of the so-called Lord?s Resistance Army (LRA) withthe full knowledge and assistance of their sponsors  who donot believe in freedom and respect for human rights.Innocent children are abducted daily  subjected to forcedlabour and military service and made victims of other similar crimes  with the support of the sponsors of theseterrorist groups. The world awoke to this horrendous crimeat the fifty-fourth session of the United NationsCommission on Human Rights  when it adopted draftresolution E/CN.4/1998/L.40  which calls upon the LRAand its sponsors to release all the abducted childrenimmediately and unconditionally.My delegation believes that without external supportthe Lord?s Resistance Army would not be in a position tocommit these atrocities and defy international publicopinion on this extremely important matter. We call uponthe international community to intensify pressure on thecountries involved to stop backing these terrorists. On theother hand  we wish to thank the United Nations bodies non-governmental organizations and all others who havebeen involved in seeking the freedom of these children. Wehope their efforts will not be in vain.The United Nations is a vibrant institution for manyreasons  among them its unwavering support for actionsaimed at advancing freedom  peace and security. Today terrorism poses a serious threat to these values. Individualsand organizations whose stock in trade is the violation ofthese values roam the globe with impunity. Recent attacksin East Africa came at a time when we thought the worldhad learned the futility of such senseless  wanton murderand destruction. It is the firm belief of my delegation thatthe international community should collectively take actionto deny sanctuary to these savages. Countries known toharbour such elements should be isolated and punishedseverely so that human freedom can be protected. Mydelegation further believes that this is an opportunemoment to convene an international conference onterrorism which must map out strategies to deal with thisescalating problem.Last year the world had only five declared nuclearStates; today we have seven; next year we may havemore. In essence  such non-proliferation agreements as theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT) have not deterred the emergence of new nuclearStates.The philosophy of dependence on nuclear weaponsfor security is  in a creeping and disturbing fashion becoming universal. This situation is creating new dangersfor the survival of mankind. My delegation believes thata new universal security doctrine needs to evolve. Allnuclear weapons should be eliminated. In line with thisbelief  my delegation calls for the adoption of an actionplan for the elimination of all nuclear weapons within atime-bound framework. Such an approach should beuniversal  and not regional or discriminatory  if it is toachieve the desired goals.Since the last session of the General Assembly several developments have taken place in the internationalarena  some of which have offered hope andencouragement  while others have led to destruction anddespair.The issue of Western Sahara is of concern to mydelegation. We are concerned by the slow progresstowards the holding of a United Nations-supervisedreferendum on the self-determination of the people of thatterritory. We appeal to the parties to overcome theirdifferences and allow a just and impartial referendum totake place.On the Lockerbie incident  Uganda welcomes theinitial moves taken in a bid to solve the problem betweenthe United States of America and the United Kingdom onthe one hand and Libya on the other. We encourage theSecretary-General to work out comprehensive and cleararrangements  acceptable to all concerned parties  so thatthe matter can finally be resolved.Today we live in a globalized world. Globalizationhas created new opportunities as well as grave risks andchallenges. Its impact has strengthened the developedcountries and weakened the developing countries. Such asituation does not augur well for international peace and20security. There is an urgent need for deliberate policies toreorient international trade and finance. The crisis in South-East Asia should serve as a warning to the world of thecatastrophe that inaction will breed. The ever widening gapbetween the developed and the developing countries andamong countries in the South could also become a sourceof future instability. There should be no delay in addressingthese problems. My delegation calls upon the developedcountries to honour their obligations and increase thetransfer of resources to the developing countries for thetransformation of their economies  so that they may becomeequal partners in the global economy.In the recent past  despite drastic limitations in bothhuman and financial resources  the United Nations hasresponded admirably to the challenges of the era  includingpeacekeeping  emergency operations and development. Ithas a commendable record which should serve to strengthenour confidence in the Organization.As we inch our way into the twenty-first century  weshould translate this confidence into the necessary politicalwill to strengthen the Organization. We should demonstrateour faith and dedication to the United Nations and itscomponent parts by providing it with the resourcesnecessary to fulfil its immense mandate. Our challenge isto bequeath to succeeding generations a strong UnitedNations  able to guarantee the principles enshrined in thepreamble of its Charter."
"169",7155,"UKR",53,1998,"On behalf of my delegation I extend to you  Sir  our sincere congratulations on yourelection to the high post of President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session. We wish you everysuccess in discharging your very responsible mission.I would also like to express my profoundacknowledgement to the President of the General Assemblyat its previous session  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  who alsohappens to be my predecessor as Ukraine?s ForeignMinister  for his efficient and fruitful work here. I believethat the results of the fifty-second session deserve ourpositive evaluation  for they gave a strong impetus to theprocess of a wide-scale reshaping and strengthening of theUnited Nations. The last session will undoubtedly enterhistory as the session of reform. I am very pleased to notethat many previous speakers have attributed thoseachievements to a large extent to the skilful and fairpresidency of the Ukrainian representative. This providesundeniable evidence that our nation is not only a consistentsupporter of  but also an active participant in  the processaimed at reforming the Organization.May I also applaud Secretary-General Kofi Annan whose tireless efforts to initiate and promote thischallenging goal deserve not only words of praise but first and foremost  our active support.The efficiency of the future functioning of theUnited Nations will be determined by its ability torespond adequately to the challenges confrontinghumanity at the start of the twenty-first century. Thepromotion of an interrelated and integral world  the searchfor universal human harmony  the protection and furtherdevelopment of the values of our civilization  and freeaccess to them — these are the main priorities on whichthe United Nations should concentrate its authority andattention.It is widely acknowledged that the main feature ofthe present development of the world community is theglobalization of political  social  economic andhumanitarian life. The advanced development ofinformation and communication technologies and theinterdependence of the economic progress of countries with their closely interwoven market of goods  capital andlabour  bring together local processes  separate events States and international institutions into a worldwidenetwork. A great advantage of globalization is thepossibility of resolving problems of individual regions andcountries by using the world?s experiences and theapproaches that have proved to be most efficient.On the other hand  recent years have been markedby some of the adverse effects of globalization. Thefinancial crisis in Asia and Russia  whose repercussionshave been acutely felt all over the world  has become asubject of special preoccupation in almost every country.In this regard  Ukraine fully shares the view that thesocial and economic impact of globalization shouldbecome a top priority on the agenda of the worldcommunity today.The United Nations  which bears responsibility forinternational stability and sustainable economicdevelopment  has to find the means and tools that couldhelp overcome the negative impact of globalization. Inthis respect  I wish to recall and reiterate the initiative ofthe President of Ukraine  officially announced in this Hallin 1995  to establish a new United Nations economicsecurity council. In the meantime  Member States couldalso entrust the Security Council with additionalassignments and the responsibility to deal with economicand social challenges that have direct repercussions forinternational peace and security.18Furthermore  there are other issues which causediscord and division among nations. These are the problemsof national minorities  deported peoples  refugees  thespread of terrorism and organized crime  illicit drug-trafficking and money-laundering.These challenges require greater responsibility on thepart of individual countries and their leaders for their ownpolicies  as well as concerted efforts by the worldcommunity to counteract them. All that means that theUnited Nations  as never before  faces the urgent task ofharmonizing all human and national interests and creatinga world order whereby a national idea is not opposed toglobal solutions. Hence  Member States should care morefor regional and universal security in order to maintainpeace and stability without prejudice to their nationalinterests.Events of last summer once again highlighted the issueof nuclear non-proliferation as pivotal for the worldcommunity. This issue remains a cornerstone andfundamental principle of preserving the world from a globalconflict. Nuclear tests conducted by two nations inconfrontation testify to the increasing urgency of expeditingthe entry into force of international agreements in the fieldof nuclear disarmament  as well as the need to ban othertypes of weapons of mass destruction.The issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation has a special meaning for Ukraine as a nationwhich inherited the world?s third largest nuclear arsenal andvoluntarily renounced it and which suffered from the largesttechnogenic disaster of this century in Chernobyl. Ukrainehas made an unprecedented and exemplary decision toinitiate the process of practical nuclear disarmament  and itstrictly honours its obligations undertaken in this field. Thatis why we believe that we have the moral right to urgeother countries  first and foremost nuclear ones  to pursuefurther reductions and  in the long run  to destroy totallytheir nuclear potentials. We also call upon the so-calledthreshold nations to abandon their nuclear ambitions.The world community should take effective measuresto create reliable mechanisms for the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and control over theimplementation of relevant international agreements. TheTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)is in fact the only internationally binding document thatconsolidates the world community around the concept ofglobal security. Hence  we have to substantially revitalizethe efforts of the United Nations and the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for its support.The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)  signedby most United Nations Member States  is also ofexceptional significance. Ukraine  as one of its firstsignatories  calls upon the States which hesitate to accedeto it to make this document effective as soon as possible.As a positive example  it is worthwhile to note the recentsigning of the CTBT by Brazil and Spain. We welcomethis important decision by these two friendly countries.For many years  the Conference on Disarmament hasbeen playing an important role as a catalyst in freeinghumanity from the burden of armaments  first andforemost  the nuclear ones. Ukraine  which a few yearsago joined that body as a full member  continues tocontribute to the success of its activity. I am glad tomention that it was under the presidency of Ukraine?srepresentative at the Conference that the elaboration ofthe treaty of the prohibition of fissile material reached itsfinal stage. As other priorities for the Conference  we areconsidering elaboration of a programme of global nucleardisarmament and of a multilateral agreement on grantingsecurity guarantees to non-nuclear nations by the nuclearPowers.The contemporary age which has replaced the periodof global confrontation has set new challenges before theUnited Nations in the field of international security. Theseinclude the growing numbers of local  mostly inter-ethnicconflicts inside countries  which cause civil wars andinvolve other nations. Moreover  these conflicts spreadacross regions or even turn into major internationalconflicts and become the source of global instability. Weare deeply convinced that the international communitymust not be reconciled to the age of “cold war” beingreplaced by the age of “hot peace”. Finding an adequateremedy to these dangerous phenomena is one of the mainissues that the United Nations should address today.Ukraine  with a population of over 50 millioncomprising 100 nationalities  has always pursued thepolicy of maintaining stability and social accord in itssociety. For seven years of its independent existence  ourcountry  contrary to pessimistic predictions  has succeededin avoiding ethnic tensions  regional division orfragmentation of the society. This has been possiblethanks to the persistent efforts of all branches of Statepower aimed at the comprehensive development ofdemocratic institutions and legal protection of nationalminorities. This policy is enshrined in the Constitution ofUkraine that was adopted two years ago.19Conflict prevention remains one of the biggestchallenges for the United Nations  especially the SecurityCouncil. It requires constant attention to potential sourcesof tension and immediate and adequate measures to preventthese tension points from growing into bigger conflicts. Inthis context  I would like to underscore the pressing needfor strengthening the mechanism of United Nations globalmonitoring and early warning of threats to internationalpeace and security in order to facilitate the SecurityCouncil?s readiness for a timely and efficient response.An important role in this respect is played byinternational sanctions which make it possible to exertpressure without resorting to force. We believe  however that the mechanism of introducing sanctions requiresserious improvement. First of all  there is urgent need towork out an efficient tool for compensation for lossesincurred by third countries observing the sanctions.Regrettably  all previous resolutions adopted by the GeneralAssembly to assist such countries so far remainunimplemented  leaving some countries of Central andEastern Europe  in particular  to cope on their own withtheir uncompensated economic losses.It is a recognized fact that peace and stability on theEuropean continent are an inseparable part of the globalsecurity system. Ukraine views the future architecture ofEuropean security as one based on the principles ofcomprehensiveness  indivisibility and partnership. Thisfundamental position determines our country?s activecooperation with European and Euro-Atlantic securitystructures  such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationand the Western European Union. Ukraine also activelyadvocates the further strengthening of the role of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) as an important all-European tool for safeguardingstability on the continent by means of political mediation protection of human and minorities? rights  strengthening ofdemocracy and humanitarian activity. Closer cooperationand coordination of efforts between the United Nations andthe OSCE should be established by making it a goodpractice to organize regular meetings between seniorofficials of the two organizations.For Ukraine  a country of Central and Eastern Europe establishment of friendly and partnership relations with itsneighbours is of great importance. In line with this policy last June Kiev hosted the first round of expert consultationsamong a number of Black Sea States to work out jointconfidence-building and security measures in the navalmilitary field in the Black Sea region. Thus  activelyshaping a favourable security environment  Ukraine isasserting itself as a natural strategic link between variousregions  for the North and South  East and West. That iswhy it was not accidental that the initiative of Ukraine?sPresident Leonid Kuchma to convene in September 1999in Yalta an international summit conference entitled “TheBaltic-Black Sea Cooperation: towards an integratedEurope of the twenty-first century without dividing lines”has received broad support.Contributing to the solution of vital global issues byfostering internal harmony in society  projecting stabilityon its environment through its active participation in non-proliferation and peacekeeping  by shaping a vast networkof regional cooperation  Ukraine  as one of the UnitedNations founding members  gives top priority tostrengthening international peace and security and aspiresto be elected next year as a non-permanent member of theSecurity Council for the period 2000-2001.This year the world community is marking thefiftieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeepingactivities. Over past decades  peacekeeping operationshave grown into an effective instrument of preventing theescalation of armed conflicts. While it is true that not allof the United Nations peacekeeping missions have beenequally successful  the overall evaluation of UnitedNations activities in this field should be consideredpositive. Despite enduring hardship conditions  and oftenat risk to their health and even their lives  the “BlueHelmets” courageously perform a noble mission ofbringing peace to peoples in the planet?s trouble spots. Inthis regard  I have the honour to propose that theAssembly adopt at the special commemorative meeting tobe held on 6 October a declaration in commemoration ofthose who served in United Nations peacekeepingoperations  an idea initiated by Ukraine.The recent practice of peacekeeping in variousregions of the world demands the development of acomprehensive basic document comprising the conceptualprinciples of a new generation of peacekeepingoperations. These principles should have an integratedblock of military  civil  humanitarian  political  legal andother aspects of such operations. We are convinced thatstrengthening the United Nations peacekeeping potentialshould become an integral component of the process ofUnited Nations reform.In this context  I should like to reiterate the need toreinforce the United Nations rapid reaction capabilities byperfecting the United Nations standby arrangements andmaking energetic efforts to set up the rapidly deployable20mission headquarters. Ukraine has made a practicalcontribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations  inparticular in the former Yugoslavia and in some of theCommonwealth of Independent States countries. We areready to continue our active participation in peacekeepingand to commit additional resources to United Nationsstandby arrangements.Our country supports all measures necessary toenhance the security of United Nations peacekeepers andmissions. In this regard  we call upon those States whichhave not done so to accede to the Convention on the Safetyof United Nations and Associated Personnel in order tofacilitate its entry into force as soon as possible.While globalization has become a driving force at theinternational level  and liberalization and economic reformsa dominating tendency within nations  internationaleconomic cooperation based on the principles of non-discrimination  fair competition  partnership and mutualbenefit has become increasingly relevant. The UnitedNations should continue to play a leading role in creatingeffective mechanisms for such cooperation.We believe that the Organization?s social andeconomic activities should focus more on countries witheconomies in transition to accelerate their integration intothe world economy. International assistance will be helpfulfor a smoother conduct of economic reforms in suchcountries and for overcoming the inevitable difficulties intransforming national economies. Subsequently  thesenations will achieve a level of economic development andthus be able to help other countries. The experience ofsome countries of Central and Eastern Europe proves thatsuch a prospect is quite possible.Based on this knowledge  Ukraine?s course towardsthe complete and comprehensive integration of its nationaleconomy into the European and global economic systemsremains unchanged.I should like to place special emphasis on Ukraine?sstrategy of integration into the European Union  endorsedby the President of our country. This strategy provides forthe harmonization of national legislation and the intensivedevelopment of trade and economic relations with EuropeanUnion members based on the partnership and cooperationagreement that entered into force last March. I avail myselfof this opportunity to commend the countries of theEuropean Union for their support  so clearly expressed bythe Austrian Presidency.We attach great importance to the regionalcomponent of international economic cooperation. Ukrainewas one of the initiators of the regional economic processwithin the framework of the Black Sea EconomicCooperation (BSEC) and of the BSEC?s establishment asa fully fledged international organization. We think thattoday the Black Sea Economic Cooperation organizationhas full grounds for claiming observer status in theGeneral Assembly.This year we are also marking another event ofhistoric significance: the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  which hasbecome a milestone in the quest of the individual to findhis or her own identity in society. This Declarationprovided a powerful impetus to the development of theinternational system of protection of human rights  thecreation of the relevant branch of international law  andthe introduction of a ramified system of control over thefulfilment by States of their commitments in the field ofhuman rights.The Declaration remains a crucial element of allhuman rights activities within the United Nations and amodel for constitutional practice in many parts of theworld. For instance  the Constitution of Ukraine  whichprovides that safeguarding human rights and freedomsmake up the essence of national policy  is based on thehumanistic ideas of the Declaration.An entire series of events dedicated to the fiftiethanniversary of this Universal Declaration is under way inUkraine. The most important of them was theInternational Conference organized early this month inYalta by our Government together with the UnitedNations Development Programme  which was attended byrepresentatives from 27 countries and a number ofinternational organizations; a booklet on that Conferencehas been circulated to members. A new Yalta spiritassociated with the observance of human rights andfreedoms was proclaimed at the Conference. This spirit isbest protected in the context of the growing role ofinternational law.I believe that it is a matter of honour for all StatesMembers of this Organization to strictly abide by theircommitments to the United Nations Charter and thefundamental principles of international law  in particularas regards respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity the peaceful settlement of disputes  and the strengtheningof the role of preventive diplomacy.21Ukraine supports the proposals to strengthen theInternational Court of Justice  which reflects the increasingtendency to resolve international disputes by means of law.The Security Council and other United Nations bodiesshould consider making better use of the InternationalCourt?s potential when dealing with international disputes.Equally important is the setting up of the InternationalCriminal Court  which should be considered in the contextof the global changes that have taken shape after the end ofthe cold war. The importance of this international judicialinstitution is supported by the fact that its jurisdictioncovers the most serious crimes committed againsthumankind.Following the recognized principle of pacta suntservanda  Ukraine rigorously adheres to its commitmentsunder international instruments and to the standards andrules of its national legislation  which are applied inaccordance with the norms of international law.The decisions on United Nations reform adopted at thefifty-second session of the General Assembly represent onlyan initial stage of the Organization?s sweepingtransformation. Painstaking work is needed to translatethem into practice so that the United Nations can enter thenew millennium renewed and able efficiently to address thepersisting challenges of the present time.It is therefore necessary to continue with wide-scalestructural adjustments and the reorganization of UnitedNations programme activities to make them more results-oriented  businesslike and tailored to the needs of theMember States.The key issue in renewing the United Nations is thereform of the Security Council. Unfortunately  promptresolution of this fundamental question does not appear tobe forthcoming  as the issue has obviously stagnated. It isin the interest of the international community as a whole tomake every effort to achieve a consensus decision on thereform of this important United Nations body. It isimpossible to imagine a reformed United Nations withoutthis crucial issue having been resolved.To make decisive progress in shaping a more reliableand predictable world and promoting economic prosperity social justice and ecological safety  we must demonstrateperseverance  courage and political will. Near-universalmembership  a far-reaching mandate  a broad spectrum ofactivities and the institutionalized presence of the UnitedNations at many levels can and should bring it to thecentre of these efforts.The authority and efficiency of this worldOrganization depend entirely on the membership. If wewish to see the United Nations truly reformed andrevitalized  we must prove it by our practical deeds. Wemust prove that people can continue to rely on the UnitedNations and that our Organization is prepared to respondto new challenges and withstand any tests."
"170",7202,"URY",53,1998,"Uruguay comes to the Assembly today with happiness pride and even excitement at seeing you  Sir  acountryman of ours  representing Uruguay  as Presidentof the Assembly. Uruguay was a founding Member of theUnited Nations and has been one of the its most activeparticipants ever since  in all its endeavours. It has evencontributed its best soldiers  who put their lives on theline every day in the difficult peacekeeping operations ofthe United Nations.Our country came to this Organization at the time ofits founding with the hopes and dreams of a world thatwas being rebuilt in order to usher in a time of peace 19prosperity and stability. It certainly did not come here withany dreams of power  which could have had no place in ourcountry given its small land area and relatively smalleconomy. But we did harbour the dream that has inspiredall our great statesmen — that of being a small  modelcountry which in the past century made secular educationuniversal  free and compulsory and built a State of well-being with a solid middle class as the foundation of itspolitical democracy. Thus did our country feel that it wasa fundamental part of the democratic development ofnations.Unfortunately  we were not exempt from the upheavalsand consequences of the cold war. As the Assembly knows the cold war was bloody and fierce in Latin America. Thehemispheres were locked in a state of conflict overpositions: here guerrilla wars and there coups d’état  bothmanifestations themselves as part of a hellish dialectic inwhich democracies were wounded and sometimes fell.The last few years have shown Uruguay to be acountry which is making strides in its economy andprosperity and which  as the recently published UnitedNations Human Development Index states  is once againmaking progress. It ranks third among developing countries and we can say that we have attained the best improvementin the hemisphere with regard to poverty indicators.However  we come to this session not only with theconcerns about its institutions and peace which alwayspermeate the spirit of the Assembly; we come here alsohaving seen the spectre of a crisis which began as an Asianfinancial crisis and which today is a global economic crisisthat touches all of us. This undoubtedly deserves particularconcern. When we see stock markets carried away by amicroclimate of psychosis  and when we see so manyirrational phenomena spread  we feel like Anatole France who saw life as a struggle among various forces  of whichwe are not always able to know which is the strongest. Attimes it seems that science and intelligence predominate. Atother times it seems that lunacy and fear prevail. This isalso part of this phenomenon that started as a financialcrisis and then became a very peculiar psychologicalphenomenon. The point is that  both as Latin Americansand as a member State of the international community  wemust once again face this situation.Shakespeare  who is often quoted in connection withmajor tragedies  said that fate dealt the cards but we werethe players. That is our challenge today: how to play ourcards in this crisis which could even affect not just financesand economies but also the democratic stability of ourcountries  our social peace and the fundamental valueswhich inspire us.In the 1980s Latin America went through verydifficult economic years. This is referred to — mistakenlyin my judgement — as the lost decade  for those werealso the years in which we consolidated the strongestprocess of democratization in our continent  which todayallows it to have more democracies and freedoms thanever before. Countries which had never before knowndemocracy are now building republics and institutions anddeveloping their societies.The fact is that after that crisis our countries madeenormous efforts at transformation. They lowered theirrates of inflation  opened up their economies and beganstrong processes of integration — in the Andean area  inMexico to the north and with us in the south  Argentina Brazil and Uruguay  and now with Bolivia and Chile asassociate partners  to the south. All of this meant that wehad a Latin America which was growing again and whichwould once again be a place for investments; a LatinAmerica which was able to harmonize the return ofdemocracy and peace with economic growth.We now find ourselves faced with the new crisis.What should we do? In our view  the first thing to do isto consolidate and support the Organization and theinternational community. We should do that here  in thisinstitution  which is a hymn to internationalism  as wellas in the economic area. The International Monetary Fund(IMF)  the World Bank and the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank — which is the main source offinancing for our hemisphere — are the tools we rely ontoday. We must strengthen them.Indeed  this crisis will leave behind consequencesonce it is over. Somehow the debate that took placebetween Lord Keynes and Harry White  at the time of theestablishment of the International Monetary Fund atBretton Woods  hangs over the world today. The Britisheconomist held the view that it was necessary to have acentral bank of central banks. I shall not bring in thatdebate here today  but I think that it will neverthelesshave to take place once the crucial moments of this crisisare over  because of the need for prevention and for amarket economy which actually works.We must all feel and know that the origins of thiscrisis have been identified. First  there has been excessivespeculation  which has been clearly reflected in stockmarkets. It also stems from macroeconomic imbalances in20many States  which have not been able to correct thoseimbalances  mainly their fiscal gaps  that have beenfundamental causes of this situation.Fortunately  the North American economy and theEuropean economy still appear to be solid. Japan is thecountry of which we are all hoping for a recovery so thatthe measures under way today will allow us to view muchmore calmly the future of this situation  which could verywell continue for a long time. As the Brazilian ForeignMinister said today  the magnitude and the duration of thiscrisis are unpredictable  but what should not beunpredictable is the behaviour of States.Therefore  it is essential that we act to bring to an endthose financial imbalances and avoid the mistakes andtemptations related to such crises. First  we should notbelieve that by isolating ourselves in neo-protectionism wewill find a way out of the crisis.In Latin America in the 1980s we had an external debtcrisis. There were those who advocated not repaying thedebt and returning in some way to more protectedeconomies. There were those of us  on the other hand  whothought that the debt should be refinanced and that weshould join the international community more actively andin that way grow again. Only by growing our economiescould the external debt be made manageable in the future.The former  unfortunately  were not lucky and the latter fortunately  were. In that way  we were able to refinancethe external debt and return to investment  and growthenabled us to pay off the debt effectively and thus achievebetter living conditions for our peoples.Turmoil and speculation are not what are most neededfor the prosperity of needy peoples. To the contrary  profit-making opportunities for speculators come at the expenseof the majority.That is the path that we see clearly defined today forthis situation  and we must all redouble our efforts in thatdirection. We will also have to strengthen anew theinternational financial community so that there can exist areal international safety net that will allow us to work inpeace.Of course  the leading economic countries have a greatresponsibility. President Clinton said last week that this wasthe most important economic and financial crisis of thesecond half of the century  and no doubt it is. That is allthe more reason for the major economies to assume theirresponsibilities and for smaller economies  such as ours which basically seeks more and more equitable livingconditions  to try not to bring bad news to the world even while lacking the capacity and opportunity to bethose who can offer the world good news.We should thus protect ourselves from a dangerousneo-protectionism and continue to fight for increasinglyopen and transparent markets  from which the persistentsubsidies in the large States disappear — subsidies in theUnited States and the European Community  agriculturalsubsidies which undoubtedly are a troublesome factor ininternational economic activities and must be left behind.If the crisis teaches us anything  it is that we must findbalance  and balance will not be found on the basis ofsubsidies which continue to promote opportunity forartificial economic sectors.We must also protect ourselves from messianicdemagoguery  which is the political dimension of thiscrisis. For that reason  warding off and resolving the crisisthrough international cooperation and concrete measuresare also very important in a democratic context. Whensuch instabilities occur  messianic demagogues appear  allthose pyrotechnists of prosperity who have always ledpeoples to misfortune and to whom we should not offer through instability  another opportunity.This is therefore a financial and economic crisis  andultimately a crisis in political democracy. It is thefundamental chapter through which we must continue towork here.Our world is living in disconcerting times. In 1989 it seemed  with the market economy triumphant over thesocialist economy and liberal democracy triumphant overthe Communist world  that we were entering an era ofpeace and stability in which the old Hegelian dialecticswould yield to a world of synthesis — what was termedthe end of history  what others called the pensée unique.Undoubtedly  that was an oversimplification.Today it would also be an oversimplification tobelieve that we have once again entered the crisis ofcapitalism. In my long political career  I have beeninvited many times to the funeral of capitalism. Timeshave definitely shown that the market economy  with itsdynamics and its spirit of initiative  once again recovered and this will happen again now because no one ispointing to a better alternative.Therefore  we must not fall into anotheroversimplification. At one point we believed that the21simple freeing of markets would bring about the miraculousresult of achieving growth and equity; we cannot nowreturn to the past and believe that through closedeconomies  through stronger protectionist measures or eventhrough authoritarianism we will be able to resolve asituation that  now more than ever  must be addressed withthe guidance of democratic principles.No one has a clear road map. Thus  there is all themore reason to reaffirm the basic principles  the first onebeing political democracy  which calls on us  as PresidentClinton said earlier  to fight against terrorism  whichthrough violence attacks democracy  in all its forms  fromthe outside; and to fight against the enemies whichdemocracy generates from within. At times we havesuffered from excessive political passion  which sometimesleads to divisions within countries  intolerance  racialhatred  abuse of economic power and abuse of the media;all of these factors are part of a democracy  but when usedwithout ethical limits they may weaken it.We also have a right to ask the citizen to participate.It is not through an alienated or indifferent citizenry thatdemocracy will be strengthened. Democracy will be closelyrelated to an efficient State  for only an efficient State canstand united if the objective is to improve the lives of ourpeople  only a State which is not a mechanism for waste but rather a strong instrument to promote the forces ofsociety; to a market economy and increasingly open tradebased on standards that protect us from unfair competition;and to a process of integration such as those being carriedout in the Latin American countries to enable us to join theworld with suitable economies to improve our production.We must also think of the basic values of oursocieties  such as the family  which is the historic nucleusof our civilization. The weakening of the family has comeat a high price. Today  the drug trade reflects the spiritualscourge of societies which  in their economic development have lost sight of spiritual values. Such societies haveweakened the family in a world where images  emptinessand passing trends have caused a vacuum that in turncauses the phenomenon of the search for artificial paradisesthat aim to replace a meaningful life. We must enhancespiritual factors to give democracies genuine content.We must  of course  be pragmatical in economicmatters  but pragmatism alone will not keep alive the hopesof peoples. We must strengthen family values  humandignity and the universality of human rights  as our friendPresident Mandela has said. We must all respect ethnicindividuality; in the final analysis we are all the same. Wemust all fight against racial discrimination; we must allrespect and be very mindful of cultural diversity. But noethnic or cultural diversity can sanction the enslavementof women or the killing of men: we are speaking here ofuniversal values that are essential to the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights and that we must not onlyproclaim but must also practice.As Toynbee said  “Civilization is a movement andnot a condition  a voyage and not a harbour” (ReadersDigest  October 1958). We must therefore clearly identifythe stars that will guide us on that voyage. It is in thosestars that Uruguay believes."
"171",7249,"USA",53,1998,"Let me begin by thanking theAssembly for its very kind and generous welcome and bynoting that  at the opening of this fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly  the world has much to celebrate.Peace has come to Northern Ireland after 29 long years.Bosnia has just held its freest elections ever. The UnitedNations is actively mediating crises before they explodeinto war  all around the world. And today more peopledetermine their own destiny than at any previous momentin history.We celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights with those rights morewidely embraced than ever before. On every continentpeople are leading lives of integrity and self-respect  anda great deal of the credit for that belongs to the UnitedNations.Still  as every person in this Hall knows  the promiseof our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoiltoday threatens to undermine confidence in free marketsand democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly fromthis economy have a special responsibility to do more tominimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of globalmarkets to all citizens. And the United States isdetermined to do that.We still are bedevilled by ethnic  racial  religiousand tribal hatreds  by the spread of weapons of massdestruction  by the almost frantic efforts of too manyStates to acquire such weapons.And  despite all efforts to contain it  terrorism is notfading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is acontinuing defiance of article 3 of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  which says9“Everyone has the right to life  liberty and security ofperson.”Here at the United Nations  at international summitsaround the world and on many occasions in the UnitedStates  I have had the opportunity to address this subject indetail  to describe what we have done  what we are doingand what we must yet do to combat terror.Today I would like to talk to the Assembly about whyall nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top ofour agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concernto us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targetedover and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in SaudiArabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our owncitizens; even here in New York  in one of our most publicbuildings; and most recently  on 7 August  in Nairobi andDar-es-Salaam  where Americans who devoted their livesto building bridges between nations — people very muchlike all of those present — died in a campaign of hatredagainst the United States.Because we are blessed to be a wealthy nation  witha powerful military and a worldwide presence active inpromoting peace and security  we are often a target. Welove our country for its dedication to political and religiousfreedom  to economic opportunity  to respect for the rightsof the individual. But we know that many people see us asa symbol of a system and values they reject. And often theyfind it expedient to blame us for problems with deep rootselsewhere.But we are no threat to any peaceful nation  and webelieve the best way to disprove these claims is to continueour work for peace and prosperity around the world. For usto pull back from the world’s trouble spots  to turn ourbacks on those taking risks for peace  to weaken our ownopposition to terrorism  would hand the enemies of peacea victory they must never have.Still  it is a grave misconception to see terrorism asonly  or even mostly  an American problem. Indeed  it is aclear and present danger to tolerant and open societies andinnocent people everywhere. No one in this room  nor thepeople represented here  is immune. Certainly not thepeople of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every Americankilled there  roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500more injured — innocent people going about their businesson a busy morning.Not the people of Omagh  in Northern Ireland  wherethe wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestantsalike — mostly children and women  two of thempregnant — people out shopping together when theirfuture was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to thepast.Not the people of Japan  who were poisoned by saringas in the Tokyo subway.Not the people of Argentina  who died when a carbomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in BuenosAires.Not the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka  killed byancient animosities that cry out for resolution.Not the Palestinians and Israelis  who still die yearafter year  for all their progress towards peace.Not the people of Algeria  enduring a nightmare ofunfathomable terror with still no end in sight.Not the people of Egypt  who nearly lost a secondPresident to assassination.Not the people of Turkey  Colombia  Albania Russia  Iran  Indonesia and countless other nations whereinnocent people have been victimized by terror.None of those victims were American. But everyone was a son or daughter  a husband or wife  a father ormother — a human life extinguished by someone else’shatred  leaving a circle of people whose lives will neverbe the same.Terror has become the world’s problem. Some argue of course  that the problem is overblown  saying that thenumber of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small sometimes less than the number of people killed bylightning in a single year. I believe that misses the pointin several ways. First  terrorism has a new face in the1990s. Today  terrorists take advantage of greateropenness and the explosion of information and weaponstechnology. The new technologies of terror and theirincreasing availability  along with the increasing mobilityof terrorists  raise chilling prospects of vulnerability tochemical  biological and other kinds of attacks  bringingeach of us into the category of possible victim. This is athreat to all humankind.Beyond the physical damage of each attack  there isan even greater residue of psychological damage  hard tomeasure but slow to heal. Every bomb  every bomb10threat  has an insidious effect on free and open institutions;the kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working sohard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman orchild is killed  it makes the future more hazardous for therest of us  for each violent act saps the confidence that is socrucial to peace and prosperity.In every corner of the world  with the active supportof United Nations agencies  people are struggling to buildbetter futures based on bonds of trust connecting them withtheir fellow citizens and with partners and investors fromaround the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity inNorthern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good FridayAgreement. But that took confidence  confidence thatcannot be bought in times of violence. We can measureeach attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. Butwhat are the wounds we cannot measure? In the MiddleEast  in Asia  in South America — how many agreementshave been thwarted after bombs blew up? How manybusinesses will never be created in places crying out forinvestments of time and money? How many talented youngpeople in countries represented here have turned their backson public service? The question is not only how many liveshave been lost in each attack  but how many futures werelost in their aftermath.There is no justification for killing innocents.Ideology  religion and politics  even deprivation andrighteous grievance  do not justify it. We must seek tounderstand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Ofcourse we must. Often in my own experience I have seenthat where peace is making progress  terror is a desperateact to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombingcame as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In theMiddle East  whenever we get close to another step towardspeace  its enemies respond with terror. We must not let thisstall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is after all  a leap of faith — a break with the past — andthus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of theirown hatred. Because they fear the future  in these casesterrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past.We must also acknowledge that there are economicsources of this rage as well. Poverty  inequality and massesof disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for thesiren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancingsocial justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; norcan inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocentsis not a social programme.Nevertheless  our resolute opposition to terrorism doesnot mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions thatfoster it. The most recent United Nations HumanDevelopment Report suggests the gulf is wideningbetween the world’s haves and have-nots. We must workharder to treat the sources of despair before they turn intothe poison of hatred.Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr.  once wrote that the onlyrevolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We mustshow people they have everything to gain by embracingcooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simplyan American or a Western responsibility; it is the world’sresponsibility. Developing nations have an obligation tospread new wealth fairly  to create new opportunities  tobuild new  open economies. Developed nations have anobligation to help developing nations stay on the path ofprosperity and to spur global economic growth. A weekago I outlined ways we can build a stronger internationaleconomy to benefit not only all nations  but all citizenswithin them.Some believe that terrorism’s principal fault linecentres on what they see as an inevitable clash ofcivilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debatein this great Hall. Specifically  many believe there is aninevitable clash between Western civilization and valuesand Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view isterribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse anyreligion to justify whatever political objectives theyhave — even cold-blooded murder. Some may have theworld believe that Almighty God Himself  the merciful grants a licence to kill; but that is not our understandingof Islam.A quarter of the world’s population is Muslim  fromAfrica to the Middle East to Asia and to the UnitedStates  where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths.There are over 1 200 mosques and Islamic centres in theUnited States  and that number is rapidly increasing. The6 million Americans who worship there will tell you thereis no inherent clash between Islam and America.Americans respect and honour Islam.As I talk to Muslim leaders in my country andaround the world  I see again that we share the samehopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security  toprovide for our children  to follow the faith of ourchoosing  to build a better life than our parents knew andto pass on brighter possibilities to our children.Of course  we are not identical. There are importantdifferences that cross race and culture and religion whichdemand understanding and deserve respect. But every11river has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here inAmerica  like the United Nations  to reconcile allAmericans to each other and to find greater unity in ourincreasing diversity  we will remain on a course offriendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We willcontinue to look for common values  common interests andcommon endeavours. I agree very much with the spiritexpressed by these words of Mohammed: “Rewards forprayers by people assembled together are twice those forprayers said at home.”When it comes to terrorism  there should be nodividing line between Muslims and Jews  Protestants andCatholics  Serbs and Albanians  developed societies andemerging countries. The only dividing line is between thosewho practise  support or tolerate terror and those whounderstand that it is murder  plain and simple.If terrorism is at the top of the American agenda andshould be at the top of the world’s agenda  what  then  arethe concrete steps we can take together to protect ourcommon destiny? What are our common obligations? Atleast  I believe  they are these: to give terrorists no support no sanctuary  no financial assistance; to bring pressure onStates that do; to act together to step up extradition andprosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; tostrengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforcethe Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote strongerdomestic laws and control the manufacture and export ofexplosives; to raise international standards for airportsecurity; to combat the conditions that spread violence anddespair.We are working to do our part. Our intelligence andlaw enforcement communities are tracking terroristnetworks in cooperation with other Governments. Some ofthose we believe responsible for the recent bombing of ourembassies have been brought to justice. Early this week Iwill ask our Congress to provide emergency funding torepair our embassies  to improve security  to expand theworldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends inKenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered.But no matter how much each of us does alone  ourprogress will be limited without our common efforts.We will also do our part to address the sources ofdespair and alienation through the Agency for InternationalDevelopment in Africa  in Asia  in Latin America  inEastern Europe  in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continueour strong support for the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and the Office of UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees  the UnitedNations Children’s Fund  the World Bank and the WorldFood Programme. We also recognize the critical rolethese agencies play and the importance of all countries including the United States  in paying their fair share.In closing  let me urge all of us to think in newterms on terrorism  to see it not as a clash of cultures  orpolitical action by other means  or a divine calling  but asa clash between the forces of the past and the forces ofthe future  between those who tear down and those whobuild up  between hope and fear  between chaos andcommunity.The fight will not be easy. But every nation will bestrengthened in joining it  in working to give real meaningto the words of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights we signed 50 years ago. It is very  very importantthat we do this together.Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of theUniversal Declaration. She said  in one of her manyspeeches in support of the United Nations when it wasjust beginning “All agreements and all peace are built onconfidence. You cannot have peace and you cannotget on with other people in the world unless youhave confidence in them.”It is not necessary that we solve all the world’sproblems to have confidence in one another. It is notnecessary that we agree on all the world’s issues to haveconfidence in one another. It is not even necessary thatwe understand every single difference among us to haveconfidence in one another. But it is necessary that weaffirm our belief in the primacy of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  and therefore that togetherwe say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only athrowback to yesterday  and together  together we canmeet it and overcome its threats  its injuries and its fearswith confidence."
"172",7273,"UZB",53,1998,"Allow me first of all to offer my sincerecongratulations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs ofUruguay  Mr. Didier Opertti  on his election to the post ofPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third sessionand to wish him every success in this important task. I amconfident that his long experience and abilities willcontribute to the successful outcome of the current sessionof the General Assembly. I should also like to express ourappreciation to the previous President of the GeneralAssembly  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for his energetic andprofessional work.I would like to take this opportunity to draw theAssembly’s attention to the problems that are of greatestconcern to the States of our region.The international community fully recognizes thedanger of recent developments in Afghanistan  South Asiaand the Republic of Tajikistan. There is an enormouspotential for conflict in this subregion today. The threatthat the Afghan conflict may explode and spread toneighbouring States remains a real one. Uzbekistan hasrepeatedly appealed to the international community fromthis rostrum for assistance in resolving the Afghanproblem.This goal should be served  inter alia  by ourinitiative to impose an arms embargo on Afghanistan. Theappeal to halt deliveries of weaponry and matériel to allparties to the conflict has been reflected in numerousSecurity Council resolutions and awaits the creation of aneffective mechanism within the United Nations so that itcan be implemented. The Six Plus Two group  with theparticipation of Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries  aswell as the United States and the Russian Federation which was established as a result of a proposal byUzbekistan  is today  in our opinion  the only effectiveinternational mechanism within the United Nationscapable of launching the peace process. Its task is not tocondemn the warring factions  to criticize them or tosupport one of them against the others. We are united bya common goal  which is to find a path to stability security and peace.A great deal of interest is now focused on energyprojects and transport communications in the region.However  the implementation of these projects should notcause confrontation  but should on the contrary promotestability and the development of mutually beneficialcooperation between the States of the region. Given theongoing hostilities in Afghanistan  the importance of theSix Plus Two group as a full-fledged negotiatinginstrument is growing. Within that framework — andwith the cooperation of the inter-Afghan forces — it ispossible not merely to elaborate the terms ofreconciliation but also the necessary measures to restorestatehood to that country and bring about its economicrevival. In that connection  we fully support the decisionsof the meeting of the Six Plus Two group held at thelevel of Ministers for Foreign Affairs  which took placeon 21 September of this year in New York. We alsocommend the efforts of the Special Envoy of theSecretary-General for Afghanistan  Ambassador LakhdarBrahimi.Recent developments in Afghanistan have confirmedthat one of the most important conditions for therestoration of peace in the Islamic State of Afghanistan isthe achievement of consensus at the regional level and theelaboration  under the aegis of the United Nations  of a17single position to be taken by the countries that have aninfluence on events in that country. Cooperation with theAfghan factions in order to reach a speedy settlement of theAfghan conflict is the ultimate goal of the proposed on-sitemeeting of the Six Plus Two group in Tashkent. We hopefor further support for this proposal from interested Statesand the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan.The problems that affect the vital interests ofUzbekistan  in particular the establishment of lasting peacein Tajikistan  the cessation of war in Afghanistan  theimposition of an arms embargo on the Afghan zone ofconflict  the establishment of a Central Asian nuclear-weapon-free zone  the construction of transportcommunications and the revival of Aral Sea are all part ofglobal international processes that are under way and couldbe implemented under the aegis of the United Nations.I believe that the events of the last decade haveconvinced everyone that no State can  on its own  resolvetransnational security problems such as illicit drug-trafficking  terrorism and the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction and of their components.The Government of Uzbekistan welcomes the effortsof the United Nations to counter the spread of narcoticdrugs and to implement the Political Declaration adopted atthe twentieth special session of the General Assembly  heldin New York in June 1998. Today  in some Europeancountries  up to 90 per cent of the narcotic drugs consumedoriginate in Afghanistan. The international community isaware of the need to take coordinated action to counterillegal trafficking in narcotic substances and to implementthe principles of international cooperation in this area onthe basis of mutual assistance and solidarity. However  webelieve that these principles should also reflect specificregional aspects. In particular  once again we call for theelaboration of special programmes to plan for concrete joint action by the States of Central Asia and the EuropeanUnion.Unfortunately  terrorist acts have become a commonoccurrence in many countries. Existing internationalmechanisms to fight terrorism  including political isolation economic sanctions and direct military intervention  are notachieving results. We should have no illusions about thisphenomenon. Today we need coordinated and targetedaction by the entire international community. In thatconnection  we welcome discussion of one of the mostcomplex issues in international law: the possibility of andneed for a new approach to the problem of terrorism. Theimportance of resolving this whole set of problems isobvious.In this connection  Uzbekistan has taken theinitiative to establish within the framework of the UnitedNations a commission for the prevention of terroristactivities and for fighting international terrorism. Themain task of such a commission would be to formulaterecommendations on questions relating to the fight againstinternational terrorism. Making use of legal norms  theUnited Nations could prosecute the organizers andperpetrators of terrorist acts. If Member States supportthis initiative  Uzbekistan will take an active part inbringing it to fruition.Uzbekistan has consistently taken steps to ensurepeace and strengthen regional security. One of these isUzbekistan’s initiative to establish a Central Asiannuclear-weapon-free zone. Considerable progress hasalready been made to implement this idea. Allow me tocite the closing statement of the President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-second session  Mr. HennadiyUdovenko:“In a decision designed to further promote theregime of nuclear nonproliferation  the Assemblyadopted a consensus resolution supporting theinitiative to establish one more nuclear-weapon-freezone  in Central Asia. The significance of that stepbecame even more apparent in the light of the recentnuclear tests in southern Asia”. (A/52/PV.92)Here  let me express our special gratitude to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and to the Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs  Mr. JayanthaDhanapala  for their well-informed and strong support ofthis initiative.When considering potential threats to nationalsecurity  we ought today to give special attention toproblems of ecological security and environmentalprotection. It is common knowledge that the drying up ofthe Aral Sea has caused many complex ecological  socio-economic and demographic problems  whose origins andgravity are international  even global. The Aral crisis isone of the most serious of the world’s ecological andhumanitarian disasters. It has had a direct impact on morethan 35 million people who live in the Aral Sea basin.A number of decisions have been adopted atinternational and regional meetings on the problem of theAral Sea. But these have not been backed up by practical18action. We are obliged to say that the idea is gainingground in the international community that the Aral crisiscan be contained through humanitarian operations. That isnot the case. This is an extraordinary ecological problemthat requires the establishment within the United Nationssystem of a regional commission on the ecology of AralSea. This initiative is justified by the need to formulate andimplement a specific long-term strategy and programme forresolving the Aral crisis on the basis of the principles ofsustainable development  maintaining the standard of livingof the people of the region  and ensuring a decent life forfuture generations.Modern Uzbekistan is in the process of establishing aState based on the rule of law  a civil society and aneffective  socially oriented market economy. It has an acuteneed for the experience and know-how of internationalbodies. At the same time  our republic is devoting greatattention to the question of recruiting Uzbek experts for theactivities of a variety of United Nations bodies. Let mestress that the level of training and knowledge of Uzbekspecialists is fully in keeping with the requirements forrecruitment to the bodies and specialized agencies of theUnited Nations system. I am confident that specialists fromUzbekistan can and should contribute to the work ofinternational organizations.In conclusion  I should like to stress in particular thatour relationship with the United Nations is intended notonly to obtain assistance and support  but primarily toenable us to play our full part in the successfulimplementation of the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations and to give fresh content to the activities of theOrganization."
"173",7319,"VCT",53,1998,"On behalf of the delegation of Saint Vincentand the Grenadines  I extend my warmest congratulationsto Mr. Didier Opertti on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-third session. His acumen scholarship and leadership skills are well known in ourregion through his distinguished participation in varioushigh-level hemispheric forums over the years.I also wish to express my delegation?s sincereappreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Udovenkoof the Ukraine  who presided over the work of the fifty-second session with great distinction.Our esteemed Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr.Kofi Annan  has continued to provide outstandingleadership in the discharge of his duties. My delegationcommends the Secretary-General for his reform initiativesdesigned to make the United Nations a more efficientorganization  capable of responding to the manychallenges it faces  and for his untiring efforts in thepursuit of world peace and security  long-lastingprosperity and international cooperation. Our ownUniversity of the West Indies  acting on behalf of theregion  has honoured him appropriately for his work inthis regard.Since the signing of the Charter some 53 years ago the world can celebrate numerous progressive changes inwhich the United Nations has played a significant part.United Nations peacekeepers have been instrumental inpreserving peace and stability in troubled areas of theglobe  and the Organization?s humanitarian missions havebeen effective in alleviating suffering among many peoplethroughout the world.At the same time  there remains a massive gapbetween aspiration and accomplishment. Despite theunprecedented prosperity that technological advances andthe globalization of production and finance have broughtto many countries  especially in the developed world  themajority of mankind is yet under the yoke of persistentpoverty.The eradication of poverty remains a priority fordeveloping countries. The Government of Saint Vincentand the Grenadines is committed to the uplifting of the lotof the poor and disadvantaged sections of our society. Inthis regard  my Government?s specific policy and17programme objectives over the medium and long term aredesigned to promote sustained economic growth anddevelopment in ways that expand employment  raiseincomes  improve living standards  increase productivecapacity and reduce poverty. We therefore call for thecreation of a supportive international environment. We alsocall on the developed countries to fulfil the commitmentsundertaken for the provision of additional financialresources in combating world poverty  that socialmalignancy which is seminal many of the other problemsthat plague developing countries.It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunityto thank the European Union for its unwavering support andmost recent decision on the banana regime for African Caribbean and Pacific countries  within the framework ofthe Lomé Convention on economic cooperation  trade anddevelopment. The new arrangements are compatible withthe rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO)  and willallow this important regional industry to achieve asustainable level of growth. These new arrangements alsocreate an appropriate environment for the survival of arestructured and competitive banana industry. It is thereforequite alarming to learn that the United States of Americaand some of our hemispheric friends in Latin America areabout to challenge the new arrangements.Such actions force us to revisit the Charters ofregional and international organizations of which we are apart and question the efficaciousness of our membership.These incomprehensible stratagems on the part of friendlycountries nurture a pervasive cynicism among our peoples who chastise Governments for cooperating with those whosay one thing and then act in a totally contrary manner thatis injurious to our best interests.My delegation is amazed by the blind and apatheticposition of the United States of America on the issue. Weare told that no harm is meant to Saint Vincent and theGrenadines and other Caribbean banana-producingcountries  while efforts are made to undermine our socialstability  which is facilitated by the export of our bananasunder the provisions of the Lomé Convention.How can we convince our citizens of the need tocombat the production  use and trade in illicit drugs if ourbanana industry is destroyed? Is it really possible that ourfriends  especially the United States  want to see theproliferation of instability  insecurity and extreme povertyin a region which has made steady socio-economicprogress since the widespread social turbulence of the1930s?In spite of the special difficulties faced by smallisland developing countries like Saint Vincent and theGrenadines  we are meeting all our internationalobligations and have acceded to several bilateral andmultilateral programmes on the eradication of illicit drugs.We have the will to fight this scourge in the internationalcommunity  but friendly nations should also understandour vulnerabilities.My Government is scrupulously committed to thedefense and enhancement of the democratic process whichhas emerged in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines andother countries of the Caribbean Community since themid-1940s with the attainment of universal adult suffrage.Our democracies are based on respect for human rights on recognition  in policy and practice  that the distributionof national resources is disparate and that all our peopleaspire to a decent standard of living  on the creation ofeconomic and other opportunities for personaldevelopment and on the observance of free and fairelections under our Constitution.After the fourth consecutive election victory of 15June 1998  the New Democratic Party (NDP) Governmentof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  under the pragmaticand visionary leadership of the Rt. Honourable Sir JamesF. Mitchell  reiterates its commitment to these principles as we join with the international community in buildinga better life for our people in the twenty-first century.My delegation strongly condemns the recent acts ofterrorism which occurred in Kenya  Tanzania  NorthernIreland and Cape Town  South Africa. Violence shouldnever be the way to settle disputes. The deaths of somany innocent people in such outrageous acts can neverbe justified. My delegation therefore urges that all partiesinvolved must review their policies  settle their disputespeacefully and use reason instead of the bomb. MyGovernment fully supports the Good Friday Agreementbrokered by the United States in Northern Ireland. Itprovides an acceptable framework for the resolution ofdeep-seated  historic differences in that part of the world.My delegation is very concerned about the illicittransfer and proliferation of small arms and light weaponsand their accumulation in many countries. These activitiesconstitute a real threat to national and regional securityand can contribute to the destabilization of States. We18urge Member States to cooperate in taking steps to dealeffectively with this increasing problem. My country waspleased to sign the Inter-American Convention Against theIllicit Production and Trafficking in Firearms  Ammunition Explosives and Other Related Materials  at the Organizationof American States in November 1997. My Governmentwishes to express its appreciation for the adoption in 1996 by the Disarmament Commission  of guidelines inresolution 46/36 H of 6 December 1991. However  we feelthat there is need for greater urgency in advancinginitiatives to deal with this issue at a global level.The end of the cold war rekindled aspirations forlasting peace and prosperity. The dismantling of the BerlinWall heightened expectations for a peace dividend.Unfortunately  the United Nations has to continue utilizingmost of its resources in managing or containing conflicts ofvarying origins and intensity in many parts of the world.The role of the United Nations in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security has become even morerelevant than before. The situations in Angola  Burundi  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  the Great Lakes region the Western Sahara and the Middle East  among manyothers countries  continue to occupy the attention of thisOrganization.We are dismayed that  in spite of the end of cold-warrivalry  the unfortunate people of Cyprus must continue toaccommodate the division imposed on their country.As we approach the new millennium  our world is stillthreatened by the existence of nuclear weapons andweapons of mass destruction and the potential for theirfurther proliferation. The time has come for all countries tocommit themselves to the goal of complete eradication ofweapons of mass destruction. I call for universal support forthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and onTheir Destruction. The Convention is clear on the total banon anti-personnel mines  which have taken the lives of somany innocent civilians  mostly women and children.In the nation-States of the Caribbean Community  thedawn of a new millennium challenges us to assert ourindependence and demonstrate our maturity by craftingcreative constitutional arrangements  suited to our particularhistorical  cultural and political evolution. We have comethus far with constitutions moulded for us by colonialmasters. In the era of independence  we have experiencedthe shortcomings of these original instruments. Many of oursister countries have already embarked on this mission  andthe Government and people of Saint Vincent and theGrenadines are beginning the process of forging a newconstitution for the governance of the country in thetwenty-first century.As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and theInternational Year for Human Rights  we call on MemberStates to remember the rights of the 21 million people inTaiwan. The Republic of China on Taiwan  bothprosperous and democratic  deserves to be readmitted asa member of the United Nations  even as it pursues thegoal of reunification. It is necessary that the UnitedNations provide the forum for discussion that will providethe framework for the peaceful reunification of both sidesof the Taiwan Strait.My delegation congratulates the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO)  for its recent success in obtainingadditional rights and privileges  such as the right toparticipate in the debate of the General Assembly and theright of reply. We hope that this new status will serve toenhance  rather than adversely affect  the peace talksbetween the PLO and Israel. Saint Vincent and theGrenadines strongly supports the Middle East peaceprocess and the negotiations which seek the fullimplementation of the Oslo accords.With the changing world environment  theOrganization has assumed new prominence  and there isrenewed hope and high expectations for  as well as newideas on  the functioning of the General Assembly and  inparticular  the reform of the Security Council. Let us notlose momentum in our common quest to give new life tothis Organization.We repeat our call  made during the Assembly?sfifty-second session  for an increase in both the permanentand non-permanent membership of the Security Council.Japan and Germany deserve their seats as permanentmembers  but Latin American and the Caribbean  Africaand Asia must be given permanent seats  which should berotated among aspiring countries in those regions.There has been much debate on whether newpermanent members should have the same rights as theold permanent members. There must be no discrimination and no two classes of permanent members. As regards theveto currently held by permanent members  in the opinionof my delegation  it is time for its abolition. We must beguided by the key word  “democracy”  as we move toreform the United Nations.19As a member of the Alliance of Small Island States Saint Vincent and the Grenadines fully supports initiativesto protect the environment. The effects of global warmingare of grave concern to small islands like ours  whosecoastal areas may become submerged  and whose protectivecoral reefs are at risk of total destruction. Meteorologiststell us that July 1998 was the hottest month since reliablerecords have been kept. We in the Caribbean can hardlydoubt this  given the exceptional heat wave and humiditywhich we have experienced this year. Our region alsocontinues to be battered by more frequent and strongerhurricanes  as evidenced this year again.Hurricane Georges has devastated several islands inthe Caribbean  leaving over 300 dead and hundreds ofmillions of dollars in damage to infrastructure  homes andutilities in its wake. The Gulf coast of the United Statesmainland has also suffered from the effects of thathurricane  providing us with a stark reminder that the forcesof nature respect no borders. I take this opportunity toextend condolences and solidarity to all those who have lostrelatives and loved ones  and to the Governments of theaffected countries. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  withits limited resources  has already embarked on a programmeof assistance to our sister countries in the Caribbean  wherewe know that each one of us is our brother?s keeper.The ecologically vulnerable islands and low-lyingcoastal States of the Caribbean are subject to all the acuteconsequences of urbanization and resource exploitation. Weare exposed to the danger of waste being dumped in ourseas and a rise in sea level as well as other effects ofclimate change. There must be a strong commitment to thereduction in greenhouse emissions. We must carry themomentum to combat climate change well into the twenty-first century in order to reduce the danger posed to ourStates.The issue of the sustainable development of smallisland developing States involves much more than beachesand coral reefs. It is about the existence of effectivepartnerships between peoples and Governments  andbetween developed and developing countries.It is against this backdrop that we look forward to thespecial session to review the Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  which is scheduled for 1999. We expect the reviewto result in concrete and practical outcomes  and to fosterthe requisite political commitment to the process.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small butbeautiful plural country  striving to maintain itsagricultural  tourism and other service industries in thisera of globalization. We  like so many developingcountries today  suffer from the problems related tounemployment. We will continue to identify new andnon-traditional areas  such as informatics and financialservices  in order to create opportunities for our people particularly our youth.We must express concern about Draconianimmigration laws and regulations being adopted by anincreasing number of countries. As a region whereemigration has been of historic importance  the Caribbeancould be severely affected by these restrictions. Thesestringent immigration policies have led to massive andsummary deportations of immigrants from our region andother developing countries. Some people facedehumanizing abuse and death as they try to escape frompoverty by seeking refuge in more developed countries.I need not emphasize how serious a threat these actionspose to the social and economic well-being of the peoplesof the Caribbean region.The United Nations stands at the threshold of a newmillennium. We pray that it continues to perform itsrightful role in addressing the many issues that occupy usin our everyday lives. We believe that the reforms that weall desire will build on progress already made in areas ofinternational cooperation.Let us work together and give meaning to ourCharter  to save succeeding generations from the scourgesof war  poverty and hunger. Let us reaffirm our faith infundamental human rights  the dignity and worth of thehuman person and particularly the equal rights of manand woman  and of nations large and small."
"174",7366,"VEN",53,1998,"Please accept my sincere congratulations  Sir  on yourelection. I am convinced that your solid academicbackground and valuable experience as a statesman willserve your country  Uruguay  well  and will strengthenLatin America?s image.I also congratulate the Secretary-General on theexcellent report he submitted to the General Assembly atthis fifty-third session. It is a document rich in profoundanalysis and noteworthy proposals for these new times.I am speaking on behalf of Venezuela before theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations at a time when myGovernment?s term is drawing to a close  in just a fewmonths. Venezuela?s words are candid and sincere  for weare ever at the ready to make our modest but solidcontribution to the establishment of stable friendship and aneffective and durable peace among all the peoples of theworld.The century that is drawing to a close has left a deepimprint on human history. Two gigantic wars nearly putan end to our civilization?s impressive progress and above all  to the respect for human rights that isfundamental to all progress. An unparalleled revolutionseemed destined to change decisively the face and destinyof the world  and the end of that revolution was the moststriking and fortunate surprise the world has ever seen.The world war that started in 1914 revealed to thehorror-stricken eyes of the world the human capacity forevil and destruction. But it was followed by two decadesof lavishness and squandering that made people forget theroot causes of the conflagration. The attempt to create aLeague of Nations awakened ideals and showed the way but it disintegrated when the thunder of cannonsannounced the outbreak of the Second World War. Thesubsequent post-war era  enriched by the bitter lessons ofexperience  encouraged by suffering and inspired by theideals of peace and liberty  lived for five decades underthe threat of nuclear war. The terrible catastrophepredicted as the inevitable result of the so-called cold warremained at the forefront of the world?s concerns until thememorable fall of the Berlin Wall  which opened the newera in which humanity now finds itself.For half a century peacekeeping has been a difficultand sometimes agonizing task. Faith in ideals was notenough to resolve the problems; what was needed was thewill and firm purpose  illuminated by experience.The United Nations has undoubtedly played a veryimportant role in this peacekeeping task  despite all thedeficiencies and errors it could be accused of. It has beenthe irreplaceable forum where all countries could talk toeach other  where all ideologies  all ethnic groups  allpolitical systems  could meet  without losing sight of thegoal of encouraging and fostering freedom everywhereand of practising and promoting  by all legal meanspossible  the democratic system  the only system that istruly compatible with respect for human rights and thefree competition of all to govern. The Organization hasmanaged to keep its respected position  and today wehope to be able to strengthen it further so as to workfirmly together to confront the new problems andrealities  something that will require ever greater efforts.The century that is coming to an end has also beena time of incredible transformations. Air travel  which had10been the dream of a few visionaries  has become aneveryday reality  and each hour thousands of people fly inand out of airports around the globe. The great adventureof space exploration has now left progress in air travelbehind  starting with man?s travels to the moon.The very nature of the planet we live on has been theobject of comparisons that take us across infinite distancesin our thoughts about the basic nature of the universe. Theposition of our solar system and the global unity we live in in relation to the whole cosmos  is a subject we are tryingmore and more to define and penetrate.Furthermore  in just a few short years  compared withthe span of history  the communications revolution hasmade the world more unified  more interdependent  more inneed of standards and systems that cannot be imposed bythe most powerful  but must be the result of consensus with respect for each individual?s identity and right to life.In today?s society we are fully conscious of theinfinite presence of what is large  but we also have aprecise idea of the importance of what is infinitely small.The technological revolution has not left an iota ofknowledge untouched by its transforming impact. And thosewho cultivate thought  pure science and art laboriouslysearch for new avenues  driven by a zeal that arises fromthe progress already achieved in changing mankind?s wayof life.We strongly favour the Secretary-General?s plans forreform of the Organization. We are convinced that theSecurity Council must be enlarged. The establishment ofthe International Criminal Court represents an importantstep in the juridical life of the international community. Thefight against drug trafficking and terrorism increasinglyrequires that the international community become its centreof coordination. These are delicate and demanding problemsthat cannot be left to the individual actions of States however powerful. The international community thereforefaces an arduous task.The fight against poverty has been one of the mostimportant aspects of international action in the last fewyears. The World Summit for Social Development reflectedone of the priority concerns of the United Nations. Theongoing activities of specialized agencies and the projectsof the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)mark out a clear path in the search for a solution to thisproblem  a path that must be extended over the wholesurface of the Earth. We know full well that peace  truepeace  stable and permanent peace  requires justice  and thatjustice is most truly expressed in social justice. This wasrecognized by the victorious countries in the Treaty ofVersailles at the end of the First World War  and it wasalso expressed in the Declaration of Philadelphia of 1944by the belligerents about to triumph in the Second WorldWar. The fight against poverty is ever more necessaryand urgent  for the market economy and the currentglobalization process cannot on their own respond to thedemands that social problems make on world leaders.In addition to its positive aspects and the progress itundeniably entails  the complex phenomenon we havecome to call globalization can also have progressivelynegative effects on the emerging developing countries.Faced with the world?s present imbalance  we musttherefore make a special point of emphasizing the harmfuleffects of international financial speculation. The balanceof terror imposed by the cold war has been replaced bya lack of financial discipline  by ruthless speculation thatis alien to the values of solidarity and ethics that shouldprevail even in technology?s most sophisticated advances.The poorest countries are the traumatized victims of thisreality  but the whole world community may bethreatened by this situation that will affect even theadvanced countries. No one can escape the consequencesof this situation. I therefore believe that today?sinternational agenda must concentrate on this criticalpoint  giving it priority over other objectives that  thoughalso important  must give way to this indispensablematter.My country?s delegation to the United Nations hasset forth  first to the Group of 77 and then to the GeneralAssembly  the need to call a special meeting to study thefinancing of developing countries. If financial assistanceto the developing countries is not addressed on a prioritybasis  if the necessary resources are not forthcoming fromthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  aswell as other agencies dealing with the basic aims ofdevelopment  globalization will not be as successful as wecould hope it to be.The effects of the Asian crisis on Latin Americahave resulted in the weakening of some currencies  asignificant downturn in the capital markets  rising internalinterest rates  restrictions to the obtention of externalcredits and a rapid increase in the risk factors for manyemerging countries.The visible effects of the phenomenon ofglobalization have demonstrated the imperfections of theinternational financial and monetary system  which has11recently been characterized by  inter alia  the sharp impactof the participation of powerful financial groups and thedecisive actions of certain parties  such as the agencies thatassess risk  certain of which have become a worse threatthan the terrible forces of other times. The time is ripe toencourage a better understanding between developed anddeveloping countries  all equally affected by financialinstability. Venezuela believes that financial and monetaryissues must have a permanent place on the agenda of theUnited Nations system. To that end  the exchange of ideasbetween the Organization and the international financialinstitutions that make up the Bretton Woods system must beencouraged and strengthened.Fundamentally  globalization will depend on thebalance between rich and poor  between the more advanced the intermediately advanced and the least developednations  and on the application of equitable formulas toalleviate the external debt burden referred to by theSecretary-General in his report.At the end of the twentieth century  there is no moreimportant objective than to steer the concern of theinternational community in this direction. If measures arenot taken to put an end to the abuses of what His HolinessJohn Paul II called savage capitalism  which gives rise with its excessive desire for profit  to unstable situationsthat are transmitted with vertiginous speed to all the world?seconomic centres  we will have replaced the fear of nuclearwar with the threat of an economic and social catastrophe.It is my view that in today?s globalized world  one ofthe primary commitments of the community of nations working through and coordinated by the United Nations  isto strengthen its resolve to prevent and correct unacceptableimbalances  and to ensure the awareness and capacity of theinternational financial mechanisms for facing contingencies.In a few weeks  the people of Venezuela will go to thepolls to elect their new leaders. For 40 consecutive years at each constitutionally determined interval  the transfer ofpower stipulated by the Constitution of the Republic hasbeen carried out. In shifting circumstances  the institutionof democracy has remained stable in an atmosphere of fulland absolute freedom. A difficult economic situation andthe winds of change that are blowing throughout the worldand are becoming stronger on the eve of a new millenniumhave focused Venezuela?s political debate on the idea ofchange. I am nevertheless convinced that  despite thechange Venezuela envisages  its people?s love for libertyand democracy as the best system of government and itscommitment to fight for peace and understanding amongall nations will remain unaltered.May I remind the Assembly that  although our fightfor political independence was perhaps the bloodiest ofthe nineteenth century  we have not had a single violentconflict with any other country since the birth of ourRepublic. In international forums  Venezuela hasdistinguished itself by its constant support for universalpeace and has always made its modest contribution to anyinitiative in favour of justice and peace. That is why I canassure the Assembly that the next Government ofVenezuela  whatever the electorate may decide  willcontinue to follow the same path within the UnitedNations. The Organization can rely on Venezuela foranything relating to service to any and all human beings or to friendship  cooperation and peace among nations and anything required by the fight against crime  poverty drug-trafficking  terrorism  hatred  discrimination — allthe evils that have beset humanity. We trust that theUnited Nations will always stand against those evils as ashield against adversity and a beacon of hope."
"175",7405,"VNM",53,1998,"On behalf of the delegation of the SocialistRepublic of Viet Nam  I would like to extend our warmestcongratulations to you  Sir  upon your election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-third session. I amconvinced that under your wise guidance the work of thissession will be crowned with success.I wish also to express our high appreciation to yourpredecessor  Mr. Hennadiy Y. Udovenko  for his majorcontribution during the fifty-second session  whichbenefited from his effectiveness as President. I warmlycongratulate the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  for his active contribution over the pastyear to the activities of the United Nations and to thereform process.An eventful year has elapsed since the fifty-secondsession. While undergoing the intense and unpredictableimpact generated by the unprecedented financial andmonetary crisis  the world community has had to facetremendous challenges emerging out of tensions andconflicts in many corners of the world  out of policies ofhegemony and imposition  and out of social injustice andthe growing gap between rich and poor countries. However peace  stability and cooperation for development continueto mark the prevailing international trend; that trend derivesfrom the age-old aspirations of humankind and  above all from the pressing demand of all peoples in the face oftoday?s swiftly changing and complex world. Thatprevailing trend is becoming all the more established in aworld context of growing interdependence and of thespeedier pace of globalization and regionalization. Thissituation also presents the international community with asmany challenges as opportunities. It must therefore beemphasized that least developed and developing countriesare also confronted with considerable challenges  and thatthe world?s development takes place in a context of variousclosely linked factors that have reciprocal impacts.In the light of the many important advances that havebeen made in science and technology  no one can deny therole played by developed countries. But the overalldevelopment of the integrated global economy cannotoccur without the active participation of developingcountries  which account for the majority of the membersof the international community.Globalization is characterized principally by therapid expansion of trade and economic relations and theswift movement of capital at the international level. Wemust nevertheless acknowledge that despite the twelve-fold growth in the global volume of trade since the end ofthe Second World War  the share of developing countriesregistered just a modest increase while that of leastdeveloped countries has been halved in the last twodecades and currently stands at 0.4 per cent of the totalvalue of international trade. Since the world?s capitalmoves faster than trade grows  developed countries arethe principal beneficiaries of these resources  with the restgoing to a limited number of developing countries.In an environment of economic opening up characterized by the growing liberalization of trade andinvestment  developing countries — havingundercapitalized industries  less efficient management anddilapidated equipment — have to confront unequal andrelentless competition in which absolute superiority isenjoyed by countries that have advanced technologies attheir disposal and to multinational corporations whoserevenues are sometimes even higher than the grossnational product of some countries. Undoubtedly  thiscannot but cause concern to the developing and leastdeveloped countries that are beginning their global andregional economic integration.Additionally  although the current financial andmonetary crisis began in East Asia  it is no longer an EastAsian phenomenon  but has spread like an oil slick to therest of the world and now resembles a dangerous stormcausing unpredictable losses across many countries indifferent continents. This illustrates the negative sideeffects of globalization and provides additional proof ofthe fact that the greater the rate of globalization  the moreinterrelated both developed and developing economiesbecome and the more they influence one another.This situation calls for the international community?sprogramme of action to include mutual cooperationbetween the developed countries and developing and leastdeveloped countries; and among countries that havestrong economies  international institutions and thecountries in crisis. It is only through this basic approachof mutual assistance that developing countries and27countries in crisis will have an opportunity to join in theefforts of the developed countries to overcome the problemsand make the global economy?s growth more stable  whichin the long run will benefit everyone. Obviously  suchcooperation and mutual assistance must be based on mutualinterest and respect. It can certainly be said that in asituation of generalized crisis  going to someone else?s aidmeans saving oneself.We believe that in adopting this approach  developingcountries and countries in crisis should fully exploit theirown domestic strengths and mobilize their existing potentialto speed up and take advantage of international aid andcooperation. As far as external aid is concerned  we believethat the individual conditions of each recipient countryshould be taken into account in order to avoid theimposition of any remedy that might worsen its situationand cause unforeseen effects to social stability.Furthermore  we are convinced that in implementing thesemeasures to stimulate liberalization  attention should bepaid to the diversity of the global economy  as well as tothe heterogeneous nature of national and regionaleconomies. This is the only approach capable of ensuringthe efficiency of our cooperation  the beneficial quality ofour ties and our common prosperity.In this light  we would like to express the followinghopes.More than ever  developed countries should facilitateaccess to their markets  accord most-favoured-nation statusto developing countries — especially those countries whichhave been ravaged by the crisis or are suffering from itsconsequences — and include them in the GeneralizedSystem of Preferences. They should also support developingand least developed countries.It is more necessary than ever to maintain the level ofofficial development assistance. This is not only necessaryto halt the downward trend  but also for donor countries toseek to reach the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent ofgross national product devoted to development by donorcountries. Moreover  this assistance is considered importantfor developing countries because it allows them tostrengthen their energy resources and contributes to buildingboth their economic and social infrastructures  elementswhich are essential for development and in order to attractforeign investments.The role of multilateral institutions — particularly thatof the United Nations — is very important in resolving thelong- and short-term problems of developing nations.However  it is regrettable that United Nations assistanceto developing countries is continuing to decline. Wetherefore welcome the adoption of measures by theUnited Nations to improve the quality of its developmentcooperation  as well as the initiative of the Secretary-General to create a Development Account using thesavings realized from reductions in administrative costs.The United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  along with other international organizations andbilateral and multilateral donors  is currently working tofind solutions to the urgent problems of developing andleast developed countries. Viet Nam has in recent yearsbenefited from their considerable assistance  which rangedfrom restructuring the economy into a market economy tospecific activities in different areas of society  particularlyin the battle to eliminate famine and reduce poverty.More recently  the effective support provided by theFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations(FAO) through the implementation of a tripartiteagricultural cooperation mechanism agreed among FAOitself  Viet Nam and certain African countries has yieldedencouraging results. We hope that on the basis of thatexperience  the United Nations will focus more ondevelopment issues and create conditions that are morefavourable for providing assistance to the developing andless developed countries.In recent years  we have witnessed the formation andexpansion of linkages among countries at the regional interregional  intercontinental and global levels. Thesemulti-level linkages among States also give rise tofavourable conditions for all nations to exploit theircomparative advantages  and they give impetus toincreased mutual assistance among various partners which leads to more equitable and sustainable growthwithin each region as well as among regions.Peace  stability and development are closelyinterrelated  like companions on the road to prosperity.Our own experience has taught us that a peacefulenvironment and political and social stability areindispensable for a nation to devote itself to achievingeconomic development. In turn  a more developedeconomy and improved living standards help strengthenpolitical and social stability and thus preserve peace.Two opposing tendencies have characterized theworld security situation since the fifty-second session. Onthe one hand  numerous events have shown a continuingtrend of peace and improved relations among countries 28as evidenced by fact that the peaceful settlement of certaindecades-long conflicts is under way and that relationsamong nations  including major Powers  continue toimprove. On the other hand  we are witnessing on a dailybasis bloodshed and confrontation in many regions  fromthe Middle East to Africa  from the Balkans to South Asia and so on.The arms race continues unabated. One terrorist actfollows on the heels of another. The list of countries to be“punished” is not getting any shorter  and the direct victimscontinue to be the elderly and women and children. Ourplanet is thus not yet out of the reach of the Damoclessword of insecurity.The painful lessons of the twentieth century — acentury replete with conflicts and wars  including the twoWorld Wars  which claimed tens of millions of lives — andthe burning desire of humankind for a better life on the eveof the new century require that we all redouble our effortsto achieve a solid and lasting peace.In today?s world  such a peace will be achieved onlyif every people and every State — large or small  rich orpoor  wherever its location — make every effort in jointlyworking towards it. Such a peace can be achieved only ifit is based on a strict observance in international relationsof the principle of respect for independence  sovereigntyand territorial integrity; non-intervention in one another?sinternal affairs; the non-use or threat of use of force; andsanctions.Such a peace will be established only when the goalof total disarmament is achieved  first and foremost throughthe elimination of weapons of mass destruction. In thisspirit  all States must put an end to the production  testing stockpiling  proliferation  use or threat of use of theseweapons.South-East Asia  as an integral part of the planet  isaffected by current global developments. In these last 50years  it has been a hotbed of conflicts and disputes and thescene of numerous bloody wars and crises. But todaySouth-East Asia?s luck is changing  and an atmosphere ofpeace  stability and cooperation for development prevails.The membership of the Association of South-EastAsian Nations (ASEAN) has increased  bringing it closer toits goal of 10 member countries and helping to put an endto the region?s historical divisions. The South-East AsiaNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty has been signed.Nevertheless  problems remain  including sovereigntydisputes in the South China Sea  that must be resolved inorder to ensure peace and stability for all countries in theregion. We believe  however  that tensions can be avoidedif all parties concerned practise self-restraint; refrain fromaggravating the situation; ensure freedom of internationalmaritime transportation; settle their disputes throughnegotiation on the basis of respect for international law particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on theLaw of the Sea; and  in the immediate future  seek toidentify patterns of cooperation acceptable to all sides.This is in line with the all-out efforts by the countries ofthe region to build neighbourly relationships of friendshipand cooperation based on the principle of mutual respect.In this spirit  as Cambodia?s immediate neighbour we welcome the success beyond expectations of theCambodian elections last July  which were recognized tobe free and fair by the entire international community.We sincerely hope that this will lead to the earlyformation of a new government in Cambodia that will setthe Cambodian people on the road to building anddeveloping their country in conditions of peace andstability.Regrettably  East Asia in general and South-EastAsia in particular  reputed in past decades to be theworld?s most dynamic economic growth area  aresuffering an unprecedentedly serious crisis. This has ledcertain people hastily to declare the demise of the miracleof the East Asian development model and even go so faras to reject “Asian values”. I would humbly suggest thatsuch views are groundless. Indeed  the current crisis inEast Asia is neither the first nor the last in the history ofthe market economy. Although some errors were made the East Asia and South-East Asia development modelhas already provided quite a few valuable experiences anduseful lessons.Are not the virtues of studiousness  industriousness thrift  intelligence  creativity and caring for one anothereternal and universal values? Moreover  there remainsubstantial economic foundations  unique cultures and theachievements of the people of the region realized thanksto their hard work and creativity — not to mention otherpositive factors  such as the region?s abundant naturalresources  large internal market and major role in worldpolitics and economics.The existence and growth of the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been anotherpositive factor in the development of South-East Asia.Despite difficulties and challenges  ASEAN continues to29become more unified  promote cooperation and play anactive role in Asia and the Pacific and the world  not onlythrough intensive interactions with dialogue partners andother international and regional organizations  but also bymeans of its vigorous work in different multilateral forums:the ASEAN Regional Forum  the Asia/Europe Meeting  theAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  the Non-AlignedMovement and the United Nations itself.After successfully hosting the seventh summit of theFrench-speaking community in November 1997  Viet Namhas the great honour to again play host — this time to thesixth ASEAN Summit  which will be held in Hanoi thisDecember. The Summit  whose theme will be strengtheningunity and broadening cooperation for a South-East Asia ofpeace  stability and balanced development  will adopt theHanoi declaration and plan of action  which will guideSouth-East Asia as it enters the next century.As a result of the factors I have outlined  we arefirmly convinced that South-East Asia will soon overcomeits difficulties and regain its previous pace of growth  andthat the international community will continue to regard theregion as a promising and reliable partner.To build peace and promote development  it isurgently important to reform the United Nations  to makeit more democratic and better adapted to confront theprofound changes that have taken place in the world in the50 years since the Organization was founded. We all agreethat it is essential to reform the Security Council so that itwill be more democratic  more transparent and moreaccountable to the General Assembly  the biggest and mostrepresentative forum of the community of nations. VietNam and its Non-Aligned Movement partners arecommitted to the position that the developing countriesshould be represented in the Security Council throughpermanent membership. In view of the legitimate interestsof potential candidates  Viet Nam will support the rotationformula if a majority of countries accept it. Our countryalso supports the proposed limiting of the right of theveto — prior to abolishing it — to decisions relating toissues provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter.This year the international community will celebratethe fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights. We have always regarded the Declarationas a great achievement of the world?s peoples in their longstruggle for fundamental rights  the most important ofwhich are the right to live in peace  independence prosperity and happiness  and with social justice  and theright to self-determination. It is unfortunate that the issue ofhuman rights has sometimes been twisted to serve as apretext for intervening and interfering in other countries?affairs. In this regard  Viet Nam greatly appreciates theposition the Non-Aligned Movement expressed in theDurban Declaration  during its recent twelfth summitmeeting  that human rights should not“be used as a political instrument for interference ininternal affairs. ... They require an environment ofpeace and development  respect for sovereignty territorial integrity and non-interference in theinternal affairs of States. Socio-economic rights including the right to development  are inextricablypart of real human rights.”Having suffered humiliation under foreign domination having been ridiculed and having sacrificed innumerablelives in order to regain their human rights and dignity our people will spare no effort to hold on to thefundamental rights they have regained.To achieve the objective of becoming a prosperouspeople  a strong State and a just and developed society the Vietnamese people are  and will remain  resolved topursue their policy of renewal and to industrialize andmodernize the country. To do this and promote peace cooperation and development  Viet Nam will continue topursue its foreign policy in support of independence sovereignty  openness  multilateralism  diversification offoreign relations  and gradual global and regionalintegration. Thus Viet Nam will always be an activemember of international and regional organizations. It willcontinue to contribute to the United Nations efforts forpeace and development  particularly in its capacity as anewly elected member of the Economic and SocialCouncil.Humanity enters the new millennium with earnesthopes for a better and more prosperous life. At thishistoric turning point  we expect the United Nations tomake greater efforts to achieve lasting peace and aclimate of international cooperation supportive of thedevelopment of every nation. Viet Nam will spare noeffort to contribute fully to the achievement of that loftygoal."
"176",7436,"VUT",53,1998,"On behalf of the peopleand the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu  I wishto join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. DidierOpertti on his election to this high and important post.His unanimous election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-third session shows the esteem inwhich the international community holds both himpersonally and his country  Uruguay. The Republic ofVanuatu and its delegation are confident he will guidethis fifty-third session of the General Assembly to asuccessful conclusion.May I also take this opportunity to express mydelegation?s sincere appreciation to his predecessor Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko  for his outstanding stewardshipin facilitating the work of the fifty-second session of the24General Assembly. I also wish to commend our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his wise leadership and hisdedication to the reform and restructuring of ourOrganization. We ask the President to assure him of ourtotal support.Three years ago  we all gathered here to celebrate thefiftieth anniversary of our Organization and  in particular to renew our commitment to the fundamental principles thatcreated it in 1945.We also made a strong commitment to furtherstrengthen our genuine  collaborative efforts to ensure thatthis Organization continues to promote global peace  justiceand a healthy environment  as well as to support theprocess of sustainable development of its Member nations in particular the small island least developed countries suchas those in the Pacific region  including the Republic ofVanuatu.The current international political and economicsituation has grown ever more complex and makesincreasing demands on our own resources and on thesupport available from our development partners.We are deeply concerned by the continuing escalationof such international crimes as drug-trafficking  money-laundering  terrorism  organized crime and other similaractivities which have the potential to place the sovereigntyand territorial integrity of small island States at great risk.The international community must show its genuinecollaboration in combating these criminal phenomena if thenew philosophy of globalization is to progress in a positivemanner.We do not believe that the world is doing justice to itspeople and to the fundamental principles of peace andeconomic prosperity as enshrined in the Charter of theUnited Nations if we do not observe our joint call for thedisarmament of nuclear weapons and other weapons ofmass destruction. International security cannot beguaranteed if we fail to accord priority attention andresources to the education and health of humankind and itssurvival into the next millennium.The momentum of the fiftieth anniversary of ourOrganization  the lessons we have learned from pastmistakes and our renewed commitment must guide us inour pursuit of a better world where  through thisOrganization  a renewed sense of mutual trust and genuinedialogue can be achieved to ease political tensions andeconomic crises in all regions and subregions of the planet.In our part of the world  these new developmentsconstitute a real threat to the already vulnerableenvironment of our island economies and populations.Confronted with these challenges  many countries in thePacific region  including the Republic of Vanuatu  do nothave much choice  at the end of this century  but toembark on difficult programmes of reform both withintheir respective Governments and within their societies.Last year  my predecessor  The Honourable SergeVohor  advised this Assembly that Vanuatu had initiateda comprehensive reform programme  with the support ofboth multilateral and bilateral donor agencies andcountries. He also made an appeal to this Assembly explaining that in order for the reform programme to besuccessful and responsive to the needs of the nationalpopulation  80 per cent of whom live from subsistencefarming in rural areas  Vanuatu would continue to needthe special support accorded to it as a least developedcountry.The role of Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko and theSecretary-General in subsequently facilitating aconstructive dialogue and a comprehensive appreciationof the economic hardships of Vanuatu must becommended.In this regard  the Government and the people ofVanuatu warmly welcome the recent decision of theEconomic and Social Council of the United Nations todefer consideration of Vanuatu?s graduation from leastdeveloped country status  pending full assessment of theusefulness of the vulnerability index and ecologicalfragility as criteria for least developed countrydesignation. We would like to register our most sincereappreciation and recognition to each and every countryand group of countries for their support.One of the commitments we all made during thefiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1995 was to reform ourOrganization so that it could be effective in addressingthe problems and needs of its Member States  bothindividually and as a group.From our perspective — and we have no doubt thatothers share it — the United Nations must include in itsreform agenda a full assessment and recognition of theinherent particularities of small island States such as theRepublic of Vanuatu  and the impact of the internationaleconomic crisis on their economic performance and thesustainability of their political stability.25The impact of the Asian economic situation and suchrecurrent national disasters as tropical cyclones  tidal wavesand global warming on our island economies has yet to befully appraised. This warrants the urgent and dedicatedattention of our Organization.With particular regard to the environment  the firstchapter of the Barbados Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island Developing Statesclearly states that small island States are particularlyvulnerable to global climate change and rising sea levels.We would therefore like to suggest  in the spirit ofreform  that the current scope of development-relatedindicators being used by the United Nations to designate thestatus of each Member State be thoroughly reviewed inclose consultation with the Member States and otherregional and multilateral organizations  such as the SouthPacific Forum and the Commonwealth.This is an important exercise at a time when we mustadjust our national administrative structures  policydirectives and legal framework to gradually accommodatethe requirements of globalization. It would be unfair andunrealistic to expect small island least developed countriesto satisfy all the administrative  financial and legalrequirements of the World Trade Organization  for instance within the same time-frame as the developed countries. Aneffective sequencing of the accession process is needed taking into account the capacity of each country?s politicaland economic system or structure to adjust withoutaffecting social cohesion.The Republic of Vanuatu is committed to the principleof global trade liberalization. The current reformprogramme reflects this. We are asking the internationalcommunity to recognize that we should be allowed to beintegrated on a gradual basis  taking into account ourcapacity to administer the process and to adjust to the newenvironment.It is in this same spirit that the Government of theRepublic of Vanuatu welcomes the decision of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly to convene theThird United Nations Conference on the Least DevelopedCountries in the year 2001.It is still in this spirit that the Government of theRepublic of Vanuatu endorses the Declaration of the eighthannual meeting of ministers from least developed countries adopted on 28 September 1998.The Republic of Vanuatu is proud to be associatedthis year with the fiftieth anniversary of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights and the fifth anniversary ofthe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.I am pleased to advise this Assembly that the currentreform programme of the Republic of Vanuatu has takenfull account of the above principles and the Government?scommitment in this regard.An example of this commitment is our widerrecognition of the rights and the role of women in oursociety through the establishment  within the PrimeMinister?s portfolio  of a more systematic mechanism ofconstructive dialogue between the Government on the onehand  and the National Council of Women and other non-governmental organizations on the other hand. The recentenactment of a first ever leadership code for Vanuatu isanother example in this regard. This will not only ensuregood governance  transparency and the rule of law  butwill also act as an effective deterrent to corruption andabuse of power by national leaders in political circles  inpublic service and in the religious community  as well asin traditional society.The pursuit and promotion of a free and responsiblepress and the protection of individual rights are matterswhich are receiving more attention under the reformprogramme. These are real challenges to Vanuatu today but they are challenges which we are confident that wecan successfully address over time with the necessarysupport of the international community.The right to self-determination must also continue tooccupy our agenda. The United Nations  as mandated byits Charter  must be seen to encourage and supportdialogue at appropriate political levels in the regions andcountries where human sufferings and social disordercontinue as a direct result of conflict of opinions on theissue of self-determination. In the Pacific region  wewarmly welcomed the signing earlier this year of theNoumea Accord between the French Government and themajor political parties in New Caledonia. We believe thatthis new agreement marks a stronger commitment by allparties to work together to support an irreversible trendfor the future political status of New Caledonia.As I said earlier  the world and our Organization willbe going through very challenging times as we are set toturn the page of this century and start a new one. Thecredibility of the United Nations in the next millenniumwill be measured in terms of its effectiveness in26responding to the real situations prevailing in its MemberStates  especially in small island States. It is therefore vitalthat we all support and supplement the process of reformspearheaded by the Secretary-General and aimed atstreamlining and strengthening the Organization."
"177",7469,"WSM",53,1998,"May I congratulate Mr. Operttimost warmly on his well-acclaimed election and express tohim  on behalf of my Government  our full confidence andsupport for his presidency.We want also to pay tribute to Mr. HennadiyUdovenko of Ukraine for his commitment and determinedleadership during the fifty-second session.At this stage of my statement  I am honoured to speakas Chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)and to do so on behalf of 32 AOSIS States that areMembers of the United Nations.I take the opportunity from the outset to declare ourheartfelt concerns and deepest feelings for the people andcommunities of the Caribbean and those bordering theCaribbean and in the southern parts of the United Stateswho have lost families and properties or have been lefthomeless by hurricane Georges. We join in the call for themost generous assistance to them all. Several of thecountries suffering severe damage and devastation — suchas Antigua and Barbuda  Cuba  Saint Kitts and Nevis andthe Virgin Islands — are AOSIS members  and we havethem especially in our thoughts at this time.For our small island States  these climate-relatedevents are occurring with alarming force and regularity.We have it from the experts that powerful hurricanes likeGeorges could be linked to the “cold event” of La Niña the contrasting weather phenomenon to El Niño  and thatLa Niña may be setting conditions favourable to morefrequent and dangerous Caribbean hurricanes likeGeorges. These were the same events described by thePrime Minister of Papua New Guinea in his address tothis Assembly last week  when he spoke of the damagingeffects of El Niño  and by the Deputy Prime Minister ofFiji earlier today. They are events and disasters whichdemonstrate and underscore the extreme exposure andvulnerability of our island communities.AOSIS welcomed the action authorized by thisAssembly last year towards early understanding of the ElNiño phenomenon and its impacts  and we fully supportthe United Nations system-wide strategy now beingdeveloped. We welcome in particular the proposalsinitiated by the United Nations Environment Programme(UNEP) to reduce the impact of environmentalemergencies through early warning and preparedness especially in the case of El Niño/Southern Oscillation. Wenote in this connection the importance of practical supportfor such initiatives  especially the generous financialdonation from the Ted Turner Foundation.In Barbados in 1994  at the Global Conference onthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  the international community recognized theirspecial characteristics and needs and adopted a specificProgramme of Action to address these needs. The UnitedNations Agenda for Development  adopted last year reinforced the acknowledgement of special circumstancesand stressed the need for international support to helpisland communities with their development efforts.The months ahead will be a critical time for ourcountries as we work towards the first five-year review ofthe Barbados Programme of Action next year at the two-day special session of the General Assembly. The reviewwill be carried out against the background of the appraisalof Agenda 21 and the assessment arrived at by theworld?s political leadership then that the overall trendswith respect to sustainable development are worse todaythan they were in 1992.The conclusions of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment (CSD) at its sixth session earlier this year which reviewed several chapters of the BarbadosProgramme of Action  highlighted the continued7vulnerability of small island developing States  particularlyto climate change  and the critical need for capacity-building in such areas as the management of wastes;freshwater biological resources; and science and technology.Placing priority on human resource development and thetransfer of appropriate environmentally sound technologiesare essential. Our national institutions and administrativecapacities have been hampered by a severe lack of financialand technical skills  and the use of regional institutions andmechanisms for coordination needs to be strengthened orsupplemented.We look forward to engaging the internationalcommunity in detailed dialogue on these aspects at thedonors? conference next February and during the otherreview preparatory processes next year. In doing so  letthere be no doubt about our own determination in thematter  for the primary responsibility for the success of theBarbados Programme of Action lies with the small islanddeveloping States  first and foremost. We will not besidetracked from the ultimate prize of self-reliance  but wemust be assured of the vital support of the internationalcommunity.The AOSIS countries continue to set high priority onthe development of the vulnerability index and will followwith close attention the quantitative and analytical workwhich we believe must continue on the index. Recognitionwithin the Barbados Programme of Action that small islanddeveloping States are a special case is further supported bythe work of the ad hoc expert group on vulnerabilityindices  which reported to the Economic and Social Councilearlier in the year. AOSIS takes particular note of theconclusion of the experts that  as a group  small islandStates are more vulnerable than other groups of developingcountries.Looking to 1999 and the work of the Commission onSustainable Development  we warmly welcome the electionof the Minister of Environment of New Zealand  TheHonourable Simon Upton  as Chairman of the CSD at itsseventh session and look forward to a successful year ofconsultations under his leadership.The agenda for the Commission?s seventh session isfull and an extremely important one: oceans  our heritage;sustainable tourism  so important to our future; and patternsof consumption and production  for we know all too wellthe need to change if our children are to have adequate andright choices for their own future. We hope that all Stateswill take full advantage of the continued constructivedialogue that we have had in the past and which we expectduring the Commission?s seventh session and thepreparations for the review of the Barbados Programmeof Action. The special session next year will provide anexcellent opportunity to agree on the next steps toimplement the Programme of Action  and to explore in afocused way the many difficulties which remain.It is no accident that the first chapter of theBarbados Programme of Action deals with climate changeand that it leads off with a clear statement that smallisland developing States are particularly vulnerable toclimate change  climate variability and sea-level rise.Indeed  the assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC) is that small island States are theleast able to adapt to the impacts of climate change.We remain at the front line of this issue  an issuenot of our making  and one that calls for urgent andconcerted international action. With the passing of eachseason  small island States experience ever more seriousimpacts  and practical steps must now be taken to assistthem  especially with the adaptation options that areavailable. The impacts of climate change put at riskhabitats and fresh-water reserves  the very life force ofour islands and communities  and thus the need forAOSIS to restate once again our profound concerns.As the globe suffers what is on track to be thehottest year in recorded history  it is essential that theinternational community as a whole be formally andunequivocally reminded that neither the efforts made thusfar in implementing the FrameworkConvention on Climate Change nor the emissionsreduction targets  on average 5.2 per cent  adopted inKyoto last year  represent an adequate effort to stabilizegreenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere at safelevels. We know from the IPCC reports that we need todo much more  and to do it immediately  by cuts ofemissions of up to 60 per cent and more.There is emerging scientific evidence  supported byexperience in almost every part of the world  that climatechange is indeed taking effect  with devastating impacts from the forest fires of South-East Asia to the extrasevere and unprecedented flooding in China andBangladesh  to the blistering heat of the Americansummer. These events  backed by science  must continueto drive the development of the Convention and theKyoto Protocol.Developed country parties have an acknowledgedhistorical role and remain primarily responsible for the8accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  andthey must be the first to accept the responsibility to redressthe situation. They possess the skills and the capacityeffectively to do so now.It is not sufficient per se to point to the newmechanisms created by the Kyoto Protocol  for there arenumerous uncertainties concerning the new mechanisms.They are supplemental to domestic actions and they needrules for governance and compliance. Nor is it sufficient tosay that developed country actions are conditional ondeveloping country commitments. In the judgement of theAOSIS countries  such commitments must be allowed toevolve over time and in line with a common butdifferentiated principle  as well as the other fundamentalprinciples of the Convention.There cannot be any doubt as to the major importanceof the first steps taken in Kyoto  and of the quantumimprovements brought about by the provisions of theProtocol. Notwithstanding the uncertainties I have referredto  we see a clear obligation on all parties to make everygenuine effort towards early entry into force of the KyotoProtocol and the implementation of its provisions. The sizeand the urgency of the problem require this of us all. It isthe intent of the AOSIS countries to apply themselves inevery positive and constructive way to help clarify suchuncertainties. In this manner  we have submitted oursuggestions and proposals in respect of several agendaitems and in connection with the preparations for the fourthconference of the parties in Buenos Aires.We would need to acknowledge that the science onclimate change is imperfect and incomplete. But the factthat we do not know everything is not a reason for ignoringthe evidence which does exist. In this connection  we areconcerned by the actions of certain industry interests whichseem yet again to be determined on undermining theexisting credible and universally acknowledged scientificfindings  findings of the IPCC and others on this matter and so to work in a negative way to influence publicopinion. Climate change is far too serious and too urgent aconcern for all humanity to be the subject of suchmanipulation.May I now turn briefly to address some additionalissues which are of particular importance to my country Samoa. First  we are deeply grateful to Mr. Kofi Annan  theSecretary-General  for his leadership and for the reformprocess he has initiated. Samoa fully supports the ongoingefforts to strengthen and revitalize our Organization tobetter position it for the challenges of the new era. We needto say  though  that it does not accord with any real senseof commitment to look to the Secretary-General forperformance  while denying him and the Organization themeans to do so. We  like so many other Governments must repeat the call for all arrears to be made good  andfor all contributions to be paid in full  on time andwithout qualification.We are especially concerned about the failure  thusfar  in reform measures for the Security Council andmeasures to deal with its current composition.Membership of the Council must be enlarged in bothcategories to reflect the realities of the present time andto enhance the Council?s effectiveness and legitimacy. Wethink the situation of Japan and Germany deserves specialconsideration.We believe very deeply in the sustaining power ofinternational law in support of the Charter principles. TheUnited Nations has been a necessary and a cohesive forcein the elaboration of international law and rules forinternational cooperation  which now regulate aphenomenal range of human activity. An important andoften overlooked fact is the comparatively high rate ofState party adherence to international instruments and theacceptance of a wide range of obligations  whether on theenvironment  social development  non-proliferation ofnuclear weapons or in so many other areas. The latestexample would appear to be the Ottawa anti-personnelmines Convention  an unprecedented global achievement which my own country has ratified  and which  by actionof the international community  is soon to come intoforce. It is essential that all countries  large and small take part in the creation of these rules for internationalconduct and behaviour. For small States  they constitute ultimately  the most effective measure of protection.Samoa was able to play a role in the Romenegotiations for the establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court  and is a signatory of its Statute. Webelieve that the Court will contribute significantly to theinternational legal order and security  for it offers  for thefirst time  effective responses to serious crimes ofinternational concern: genocide  crimes against humanity war crimes and the crime of aggression. The challengenow is to bring the Statute into force and to implement itsprovisions. We all have a duty to see to this  at theearliest moment. As the Secretary General has said  it isan opportunity to take a monumental step in the name ofhuman rights and the rule of law. Let me note here ourwelcome for the recent and very important findings anddecision of the International Tribunal for Rwanda in9respect of the offences of genocide and crimes againsthumanity.Our Pacific region is one of peace  and we treasureour peace. But our security and environment have been putunder threat by explosions and the testing of far too manynuclear weapons. We will continue with our quest for atotal ban through the development and the implementationof the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty  the secondoldest of the international regional arrangements  and wecall for the active participation and support of all nuclear-weapon States for the Treaty and its protocols. In likemanner  we will give solid backing to all internationalefforts towards the final elimination of these weapons  inparticular  the resolutions of this House on the landmarkAdvisory Opinion of the International Court of Justiceconcerning the obligation to pursue in good faith and tobring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nucleardisarmament in all its aspects.Samoa condemns all testing of nuclear weapons  as wedid the underground testing in the South Asia region earlierin the year. However  we have heard in this Hallencouraging statements by India and Pakistan  and we joinothers in urging that they commit to a lasting moratoriumby becoming parties to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and that they adhere to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).Let me say also that we applaud Brazil?s accession tothe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.We welcome these positive developments most warmly.The United Nations remains a significant part of themodern development and progress of my country. It is withcomplete faith that we renew our commitment to theCharter. We do so as a small country and with abiding trustin the principles of the Charter and the most supportiveconcern for the welfare of the Organization."
"178",7514,"YEM",53,1998,"On behalf of the delegation of the Republic ofYemen  I have great pleasure in expressing to Mr. Opertti38our heartfelt congratulations on his election as President ofthe present session of the General Assembly. We areconfident that his competence and experience will enablehim to guide the sessionâs deliberations and achieve itsobjectives.At the same time  I should like to express ourrecognition of the good offices of Mr. Kofi Annan Secretary-General of the Organization  and of his greatsuccess in serving peace within the framework ofpreventive diplomacy in order to defuse international crisesbefore they flare up and to protect innocent victims. I alsohave great pleasure in noting the intellectual andorganizational efforts that are being made to revitalizeUnited Nations activities in order to keep abreast ofdevelopments at the end of the present century and meetthe demands of the next. We wish Mr. Annan every successin carrying out his future tasks.The Republic of Yemen  its Government and people has made consistent endeavours to strengthen democraticpractices based on political pluralism  freedom of the press guarantees of public freedom and the protection of humanrights.The Republic of Yemen has realized the vitalimportance of carrying out political  economic  financialand administrative reforms  together with a programme ofstabilization and restructuring. When the due historicalprocess brought about the unity of the country  Yemeninherited two political and economic systems based ondifferent organizational  cultural and ideological structures.The Republic of Yemen  which represents the unitedYemen  has therefore launched a process of radical politicaland institutional reform intended to bring about national social and political integration  making democratic practicesmore deeply entrenched and increasing societyâsparticipation in the political decision-making process. Thisincludes increasing the social role of Yemeni women liberating them from all constraints on their participationand encouraging their integration in development.Naturally  bringing about economic and administrativereforms based on an open and liberal economy  free tradeand the increased participation of the private sector requiresnew legal and administrative mechanisms which may havea negative impact on segments of society with limitedincome and on the unemployed. Undoubtedly  this providesan incentive for the provision of assistance for all thecountries engaged in this experience  including Yemen  inorder to achieve the concrete economic and financial resultsthat can alleviate the negative impact of such changes onthe social sectors that are unable to respond to the processof economic and financial adjustment and appropriaterestructuring in a natural and appropriate way. That iswhy it is imperative for the economic reform process tobe accompanied by a social safety net to ensure socialand economic equilibrium and alleviate the impact ofchange affecting the poor  unemployed and limited-income groups  with regard to their simple lives andsubsistence existence.This is a task which makes it incumbent upon theinternational financial institutions to recognize theirresponsibilities in those areas and to intensify theirdevelopment programmes with social  demographic andenvironmental dimensions. The flow of investments andassistance from rich countries to the less developedcountries have to be increased in order to bridge thestructural gap and enable our society to integrate andincrease its positive partnership in sustainabledevelopment.The world today is based on integration andcomplementarity. It aspires to globalization based on freetrade  free exchange and open markets. However  thesecan only be achieved by regional cooperation ofgovernment and private sectors of the countries of eachregion. Thus our transition to globalization can beachieved through the bridges of regional cooperation enabling us to make gains and achieve the commoninterests of our peoples without disregarding specificitiesor neglecting elements of harmony and regionalintegration. This approach would undoubtedly help inmaking concrete the spirit of fraternity  interdependenceand integration  and would provide an opportunity toensure that the fundamental factors for peace andacceptable coexistence exist  with respect to all regionalparties  which will assist in ensuring a balanced andcomprehensive world peace.In this context  we demand that help and assistancebe provided to the developing countries and the leastdeveloped countries  in order to enable them to minimizethe negative impact of the globalization of the worldeconomy on their national economies and to achievelevels enabling them to participate with the developedcountries through competitiveness in producing highquality commodities at competitive prices. This could beaccomplished once they have made reasonable progress inthe context of regional integration.Democracy  social justice  human rights  economicand political reforms and serious regional cooperation can39only be achieved when there is peace  stability and fullsecurity. Today  given the unstable nature of peace in ourregion  we are again apprehensive lest the situation explode.This is due to Israeli intransigence and continuous disregardof the resolutions of international legitimacy. It is also duenot only to the Netanyahu Administrationâs continuedrejection of international resolutions obliging Israel towithdraw from the Palestinian occupied territories  theoccupied Golan Heights and South Lebanon  but also of theundertakings of the previous Administration of the lateYitzhak Rabin at the Madrid Conference and in the Osloaccords.The current construction of new settlements; thechanging of the historical heritage of East Jerusalem including the attempts to obliterate its Arab identity; thechanging of historical realities and demography: all thistestifies to the present Israel Governmentâs flagrantobstinacy and arrogance. We therefore demand that thesepractices  which present further obstacles to the peaceprocess  be halted forthwith.In order to prevent the region being plunged back intothe cycle of conflict  tension and bloodshed  we appeal tothe international community to take the necessary measuresto compel Israel to honour its international obligations pursuant to the resolutions of international legitimacy andall other relevant obligations and agreements.It has become clear that the policy of starvation deprivation and economic sanctions imposed on States whether individually or collectively  is of no avail as aneffective means to the realization of certain political goals especially in an era in which freedom  democracy  andenhanced respect for human rights and the right to self-determination are reaffirmed. Consequently  the victims ofthis policy are the most vulnerable sectors of the targetedStates. That is why we must reconsider the policy ofimposing sanctions  and must reassess their impact reaffirming the importance of humanitarian values andensuring that the real interests of peoples are not arbitrarilyviolated or threatened for reasons of which these peoplesare innocent. As we have already said  sanctions are nolonger a useful tool for the realization of politicalobjectives. We must engage in peaceful dialogue  anddefine a time framework and agreed criteria for thesanctions before they are imposed and put into effect. Wemust also ensure that the people and the poorest socialsectors are not the first and direct victims  as is currentlythe case in Iraq and Libya.While reaffirming respect for internationalresolutions  we reiterate the need to lift the sanctions fromIraq and Libya. These have caused serious damage andsevere human suffering in these fraternal countries.Children  old people and women have been particularlyaffected.Terrorism has become an international phenomenon and its effects and repercussions are not confined to anyone country  people or ideology. It concerns all nationsand peoples  and there is a pressing need for theinternational community to respond immediately to thedemand to establish a political  intellectual andinstitutional system at the international and regional levelsin order to combat it and eradicate the causes of thisuncivilized and inhuman phenomenon  and to deal with itsnegative consequences.In this regard  the Republic of Yemen has absolutelyrejected all forms of terrorism. Yemen shares the feelingsof every member of the international community: fear andconcern at the continuation and increase of this anti-civilizational phenomenon which goes counter to allhuman values. We therefore call for genuine cooperationto combat this phenomenon collectively and responsibly.My country pays particular attention to developmentsin fraternal Somalia. We hope that the internationalcommunity will help to resolve the conflict between thevarious warring factions and political groupings. But atthe same time we would like to remind our brothers inSomalia that there can be no solution without thecooperation of the Somalis themselves primarily withregard to the solutions offered to them from abroad.Our concern for the situation in Somalia is a resultof our feelings of fraternal responsibility  in addition tobeing a duty dictated by neighbourliness  especially sincewe are the only country in the region that has receivedwaves of refugees from Somalia and other countriesfleeing either national conflicts or purely economiccircumstances. The Republic of Yemen has paid a highprice and has sustained heavy suffering for its proximityto the Horn of Africa.Our modest potentialities are not adequate to dealwith this human influx into our country. We already havedifficulty meeting the needs of our own population. Therefugees have exacerbated our difficulties  and representan intolerable economic and social burden. The provisionsmade by the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees are insufficient to meet the40needs of the refugees in our country. We therefore requestthe international community to provide us forthwith withassistance in carrying out our humanitarian responsibilitiestowards our refugee brothers. We further call upon allparties in the Horn of Africa and the concerned Arabparties to cooperate in reaching realistic solutions to thisprotracted crisis.Many years have elapsed since the issue of reformingthe United Nations was first raised  especially with regardto equitable geographical representation on the SecurityCouncil and the formulation of criteria to limit the coerciveuse of the veto. We fully support the call for the applicationof democratic norms in and universal representation on theCouncil in order to reflect the growth of the membership ofthe General Assembly since the 1950s and the majordevelopments since the fall of the Berlin Wall  the end ofthe cold war and the expansion of the horizons ofglobalization â€” all of which make it imperative to reformthe Security Council. It is a pressing need that must beanswered if justice and democracy in international relationsare to be achieved  in conformity with the increasedcontacts and improved relations between peoples.We therefore support the Open-ended Working Groupset up for this purpose. We appreciate what has beenachieved within the framework of its mandate  pursuant tothe resolution of the forty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly in 1993. We also appreciate the cooperationdemonstrated by this Working Group. We call for thecontinuation of its work in order to fulfil its mandate at anearly date.It is incumbent upon us to cooperate in creating anappropriate atmosphere for the establishment of a newinternational order based on justice  freedom of choice andtolerance. It is our responsibility to work together forhumanity and its prosperity  and to draw ever closer to ourobjective to live as neighbours on the planet."
"179",7580,"ZAF",53,1998,"Mr. President  may I take thisopportunity  as President of the Republic of South Africaand as Chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement  toextend to you our sincere congratulations on your electionto the high post of President of the General Assembly.You will be presiding over this august Assembly ofthe nations of the world at a time when its deliberations anddecisions will be of the greatest consequence to thecontinuous striving of humanity at last to achieve globalpeace and prosperity.The Non-Aligned Movement  as well as my owncountry  which is a proud member of that Movement invests great trust in this Organization to discharge itsresponsibilities to all nations  especially at this criticalperiod of its existence.Quite appropriately  this fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly will be remembered through the ages asthe moment at which we marked and celebrated the fiftiethanniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights. Born in the aftermath of the defeat of theNazi and fascist crime against humanity  this Declarationheld high the hope that all our societies would  in future  bebuilt on the foundations of the glorious vision spelt out ineach of its clauses.For those who had to fight for their emancipation those such as ourselves  who  with United Nations help  hadto free ourselves from the criminal apartheid system  theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights served as thevindication of the justice of our cause.At the same time  it constituted a challenge to usthat our freedom  once achieved  should be dedicated tothe implementation of the perspectives contained in theDeclaration.Today we celebrate the fact that this historicdocument has survived a turbulent five decades  whichhave seen some of the most extraordinary developmentsin the evolution of human society.These include the collapse of the colonial system the passing of a bipolar world  breathtaking advances inscience and technology and the achievement of thecomplex process of globalization.And yet  at the end of it all  the human beings whoare the subject of the Universal Declaration of HumanRights continue to be afflicted by wars and violentconflicts.They have  as yet  not attained their freedom fromfear of death that would be brought about by the use ofweapons of mass destruction as well as conventionalarms.Many are still unable to exercise the fundamentaland inalienable democratic rights that would enable themto participate in the determination of the destiny of theircountries  nations  families and children and to protectthemselves from tyranny and dictatorship.The very right to be human is denied every day tohundreds of millions of people as a result of poverty andthe unavailability of basic necessities  such as food  jobs water and shelter  education  health care and a healthyenvironment.The failure to achieve the vision contained in theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights finds dramaticexpression in the contrast between wealth and povertywhich characterizes the divide between the countries ofthe North and the countries of the South and withinindividual countries in all hemispheres.It is made especially poignant and challenging by thefact that this coexistence of wealth and poverty  theperpetuation of the practice of the resolution of inter-Stateand intra-State conflicts by war and the denial of thedemocratic right of many across the world  all result fromacts of commission and omission  particularly by thosewho occupy positions of leadership in politics  in theeconomy  and in other spheres of human activity.13What I am trying to say is that all these social ills which constitute an offence against the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights  are not a preordained resultof the forces of nature or the product of a curse of thedeities.They are the consequence of decisions which men andwomen take or refuse to take  men and women all of whomwill not hesitate to pledge their devoted support for thevision conveyed in the Universal Declaration of HumanRights.This Declaration was proclaimed as universal preciselybecause the founders of this Organization and the nationsof the world that joined hands to fight the scourge offascism  including many that still had to achieve their ownemancipation  understood clearly that our human world wasan interdependent whole. Necessarily  the values ofhappiness  justice  human dignity  peace and prosperityhave a universal application  because each people and everyindividual is entitled to them. Similarly  no people can trulysay it is blessed with happiness  peace and prosperity whereothers  as human as themselves  continue to be afflictedwith misery  conflict  terrorism and deprivation.Thus can we say that the challenge posed by the next50 years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  andby the next century whose character it must help to fashion consists in whether humanity  and especially those who willoccupy positions of leadership  will have the courage toensure that at last we build a human world consistent withthe provisions of that historic Declaration and other humanrights instruments that have been adopted since 1948.Immediately  a whole range of areas of conflictconfronts us  in Africa  Europe and Asia. All of us arefamiliar with these  which range from the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Angola and Sudan on my owncontinent  to the Balkans in Europe and Afghanistan Tajikistan and Sri Lanka in Asia.Clearly  this Organization  and especially the SecurityCouncil  acting together with people of goodwill in thecountries and areas concerned  has a responsibility to actdecisively to contribute to the termination of thesedestructive conflicts. Continuously  we have to fight todefeat the primitive tendency towards the glorification ofarms  the adulation of force  born of the illusion that justicecan be guaranteed by the capacity to kill  or that disputesare necessarily best resolved by resort to violent means.As Africans  we are grateful to the Secretary-Generalfor the contribution he has made to help us find the waytowards ending violent strife on our continent. We havetaken heed of his report  which will reinforce our effortsto banish war from our shores. I have not yet read thereport from page to page  but I will try to do so.The very first resolution of the General Assembly adopted in January 1946  sought to address the challengeof“the elimination from national armaments of atomicweapons and of all other major weapons adaptableto mass destruction”. (resolution 1 (I)  para. 5 (c))We must face the fact that after countless initiativesand resolutions  we still do not have concrete andgenerally accepted proposals supported by a clearcommitment by the nuclear-weapon States to the speedy final and total elimination of nuclear weapons andnuclear-weapon capabilities.We take this opportunity to salute our sisterRepublic of Brazil for its decision to accede to the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to urgeall others that have not yet done so to follow thisexcellent example.In an honest attempt to contribute to the definitionof the systematic and progressive steps required toeliminate these weapons and the threat of annihilationwhich they pose  South Africa  together with Brazil Egypt  Ireland  Mexico  New Zealand  Slovenia andSweden  will be submitting a draft resolution to the FirstCommittee for consideration by the Assembly. It isappropriately titled “Towards a nuclear-weapon-freeworld: the need for a new agenda”.I call with all humility on all Members of the UnitedNations seriously to consider this important draftresolution and to give it their support. We must ask thequestion  which might sound naive to those who haveelaborated sophisticated arguments to justify their refusalto eliminate these terrible and terrifying weapons of massdestruction — why do they need them  anyway?In reality  no rational answer can be advanced toexplain in a satisfactory manner what  in the end  is theconsequence of cold-war inertia and an attachment to theuse of the threat of brute force to assert the primacy ofsome States over others.14Urgent steps are also required to arrive at a just andpermanent peace in the Middle East on the basis of therealization of the legitimate aspirations of the people ofPalestine and respect for the independence and security ofall the States of this important region. We also lookforward to the resolution of the outstanding issues ofWestern Sahara and East Timor  convinced that it ispossible to take these matters off the world agenda on thebasis of settlements that meet the interests of all the peoplesconcerned.Similarly  we would like to salute the bold steps takenby the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  thissupremely important country of Africa  to enable it toreturn to democratic rule and a system of governancedirected at serving the interests of all its people.Together we are also faced with the scourges of drugabuse and the illicit traffic in narcotics  organizedtransnational crime and international terrorism. We stronglysupport the measures adopted or being discussed by theUnited Nations to deal with these challenges and commitour country and Government to cooperate fully in allregional and international initiatives to ensure that thepeoples of the world  including our own  are spared thedestructive impact of these crimes.The world is gripped by an economic crisis  which  asPresident Clinton said in this city only a week ago  hasplunged millions into sudden poverty and disrupted anddisoriented the lives of ordinary people  and brought deeppersonal disappointment to tens of millions of peoplearound the world.President Clinton also said:“Recent press reports have described an entiregeneration working its way into the middle class forover 25 years  then being plummeted into povertywithin a matter of months. The stories areheartbreaking — doctors and nurses forced to live inthe lobby of a closed hospital; middle-class familieswho owned their own homes  sent their children tocollege  travelled abroad  now living by selling theirpossessions.”President Clinton said that “fast-moving currents” inthe world economy“have brought or aggravated problems in Russia andAsia. They threaten emerging economies from LatinAmerica to South Africa” and he spoke of sacrificing lives in the name of economictheory.He further recognized that with a quarter of theworld’s population in declining growth  the United States in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan’swords “ cannot forever be an oasis of prosperity.' Growthat home depends upon growth abroad”.I have quoted the President of the United States atsuch length both because he is correct and because he isthe leader of the most powerful country in the world.Accordingly  we would like to believe that with theproblem facing all humanity  and especially the poor having thus been recognized  courage will not desert thepowerful when it comes to determining the correct courseto be taken  and following this course  addressing thechallenge that has been identified.The tragedy President Clinton describes goes farbeyond the sudden impoverishment of the middle class towhich he correctly refers. Poverty has been and is thecondition of the daily existence of even larger numbers ofordinary working people. Paradoxically  the challenge ofpoverty around the globe has been brought into sharpfocus by the destructive fast movements of currents ofwealth from one part of the world to another.Put starkly  we have a situation in which the furtheraccumulation of wealth  rather than contributing to theimprovement of the quality of life of all humanity  isgenerating poverty at a frighteningly accelerated pace.The imperative to act on this urgent  life-and-deathmatter can no longer be ignored. The central challenge toensure that the countries of the South gain access to theproductive resources that have accumulated within theworld economy should not be avoided by seeking toapportion as much blame as possible to the poor.Clearly  all relevant matters will have to beaddressed  including such issues as greater inflows oflong-term capital; terms of trade; debt cancellation;technology transfers; human resource development; theemancipation of women and the development of theyoung; the elimination of poverty; the HIV/AIDSepidemic; environmental protection; and the strengtheningof financial and other institutions relevant to sustainedeconomic growth and development.15Fortunately  it is no longer in dispute that serious workwill also have to be done to restructure the multilateralfinancial and economic institutions so that they address theproblems of the modern world economy and becomeresponsive to the urgent needs of the poor of the world.Similarly  this very Organization  including itsimportant Security Council  must itself go through its ownprocess of reformation so that it serves the interests of thepeoples of the world  in keeping with the purposes forwhich it was established.The issues we have mentioned were discussed in acomprehensive manner at the Twelfth Summit Conferenceof the Non-Aligned Movement held in the city of Durban South Africa  earlier this month.I am privileged to commend the decisions of thatimportant meeting to the General Assembly and the UnitedNations as a whole  including the Durban Declaration which the Summit adopted unanimously. I am certain thatthe decisions adopted by the Non-Aligned Movement willgreatly assist this Organization in its work and furtherenhance the contribution of the countries of the South to thesolution of the problems that face the nations of the world both rich and poor.This is probably the last time I will have the honourto stand at this rostrum to address the General Assembly.Born as the First World War came to a close  and departingfrom public life as the world marks half a century of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  I have reached thatpart of the long walk when the opportunity is granted  as itshould be to all men and women  to retire to some rest andtranquillity in the village of my birth.As I sit in Qunu  my village  and grow as ancient asits hills  I will continue to entertain the hope that there hasemerged a cadre of leaders in my own country and region on my continent and in the world  which will not allow thatany should be denied their freedom  as we were; that anyshould be turned into refugees  as we were; that any shouldbe condemned to go hungry  as we were; that any shouldbe stripped of their human dignity  as we were.I will continue to hope that Africa’s renaissance willstrike deep roots and blossom forever  without regard to thechanging seasons. Were all these hopes to translate into arealizable dream and not a nightmare to torment the soul ofthe aged  then will I  indeed  have peace and tranquillity.Then would history and the billions throughout the worldproclaim that it was right that we dreamt and that wetoiled to give life to a workable dream."
"180",7623,"ZMB",53,1998,"Let me start bycongratulating Mr. Didier Opertti on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.In the same breath  I thank his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Hennadiy Udovenko of Ukraine  for the able manner inwhich he conducted the work of the fifty-second session. Ialso wish to express my delegation?s sincere appreciation toour brother  the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. KofiAnnan  for his wise leadership of the United Nations andfor his exceptional report on the work of the Organization.We are gathered here once again to review theinternational situation. The fifty-second session of theAssembly had before it the document submitted by theSecretary-General entitled “Renewing the United Nations:a programme for reform”. The debate on that item was asserious as it was animated. It became clear that the UnitedNations in its present form is unable to respond to therealities of the present world order  much less to theexigencies of the new millennium. For the United Nationsto do so  it must reinvent itself  and become moredemocratic  efficient and  of course  financially stable. Thiswould befit an Organization created to serve the demandingneeds of humankind through its impact on economic andsocial development  especially in the developing countries.Zambia would like to reiterate that the developmentmandate of the United Nations must be given priority andprominence in the reform process.Furthermore  after the issue of reform was debated lastyear  it was made clear that the critical financial situationof the United Nations was itself a major stumbling block tothe Organization?s efforts not only to reform itself  but toaddress the priorities it has set itself to accomplish. Wetherefore reiterate our call for arrears owed to the UnitedNations to be paid in full  on time and withoutpreconditions.The reform of the Security Council is without doubtthe core issue which must be addressed  with a view tomaking the Council more democratic. Essentially  theCouncil must be enlarged to enhance its credibility and atthe same time to reflect the universal character of theUnited Nations; this would remove the imbalances thatcharacterize the present composition of the Council. Tothis end  the Zambian delegation wishes to reiterate thecall made at the twelfth Summit of the Countries of theNon-Aligned Movement  held in Durban  in neighbouringSouth Africa  that expansion of the Security Councilshould be by no less than 11 new seats  based on theprinciple of equitable geographical distribution and  ofcourse  bearing in mind the sovereign equality of MemberStates.Zambia further reiterates its support for the demandthat the regions of Africa  Asia and Latin America andthe Caribbean should now have permanent seats on anexpanded Security Council.With specific regard to Africa  my delegation wishesto reaffirm the decision taken at the summit of heads ofState of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) inHarare in 1997 that five seats  of which two permanent should be allocated to the African continent and that  ina 26-member Security Council  the African seats shouldbe rotated in accordance with the agreed criteria of theAfrican Group. My delegation further wishes to reiteratethe common view that the veto power in the SecurityCouncil is a mere anachronism. It must be restricted andultimately eliminated.In the field of international peace and security  theneed for disarmament in all its aspects is as urgent asever. To be sure  the lure of nuclear-weapons possessionhas become even stronger and the use of conventionalweapons  particularly small arms  is prevalent in theworld today.To put an end to nuclear-weapons proliferation  thenuclear-weapon States have a major responsibility to leadthe international community towards nuclear disarmament particularly in the Conference on Disarmament. TheConference must establish an ad hoc committee to beginnegotiations on a phased programme for the completeelimination of nuclear weapons within a specified time-27frame. The nuclear-weapon States should also lead theinternational community in sustained efforts to conclude anuclear weapons convention.Furthermore  Zambia believes that the time is nowoverdue for the convening of the fourth special session ofthe General Assembly devoted to disarmament  whichwould offer an opportunity for a thorough review andassessment of the implementation of the provisions of theFinal Document of the first special session of the GeneralAssembly devoted to disarmament  held in 1978.Allow me at this juncture to turn to the situation inour region  with specific reference to the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Angola and  of course  Lesotho.With regard to the situation in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  I want to confirm that Zambia through its President  Mr. Frederick Chiluba  has beenactively involved in the search by all regional leaders for alasting and peaceful solution. The leaders of the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC)  under the ableleadership of President Mandela of South Africa and otherregional leaders  have done a commendable job in thisregard — of course  under very difficult circumstances.As we are all well aware  the maintenance ofinternational peace and security is the primary responsibilityof no other body than this Organization and its SecurityCouncil. There is no doubt  therefore  that the situation inthe neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo  ifunresolved  could pose a threat not only to the region  butalso to international peace and security. The mediationefforts of SADC and other regional leaders thereforedeserve the support of the international community in orderto forestall the threat to international peace and securitywhich the crisis poses.The situation in Angola has continued to worsen despite the patience and efforts of the internationalcommunity to bring Africa?s oldest civil war to an end.Zambia  as a neighbouring country and as host to the peacetalks which finally resulted in the signing of the LusakaProtocol in November 1994  is extremely concerned aboutthe regression in the Angolan peace process. While theanger and disappointment of the international communityare understandable and justified  it would not be advisablefor us  at this moment  to abandon the peace process inAngola. We have come this far after long and painstakingefforts and invested a great amount of resources in theAngolan peace process. We cannot afford now to abandonthe Angolan people  who have suffered so much and whosehopes were pinned on the Lusaka Protocol. We hope therefore  that in spite of the setbacks  the internationalcommunity  through this body  will reassert its authorityand use its immense wisdom to put the Angolan peaceprocess back on track.Zambia wishes to recognize the very noble andprofessional efforts of our brother  the late AliouneBlondin Beye  in this process. He died without seeing hisefforts result in peace and stability in Angola. May hissoul rest in peace. It is important  however  to ensure thathis efforts were not in vain by working harder ultimatelyto bring durable peace to Angola.My country is also concerned about recentdevelopments in Lesotho. As a member of SADC Zambia is fully in support of the role which thatorganization is playing in trying to bring about a peacefulsettlement. In this regard  we wish to appeal to theinternational community to give necessary support to theSADC efforts  spearheaded by Botswana  Mozambique South Africa and Zimbabwe.It is now common knowledge that Africa as a wholehas begun to make significant economic and politicalprogress in recent years. However  in many parts of thecontinent  progress remains threatened or  indeed impeded by conflict. United Nations records show that since 1970  more than 30 wars have been fought in Africaalone  the vast majority of them intra-State in origin.In this regard  my delegation wishes once again tocongratulate our brother  Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his excellent report to the Security Council last Aprilon the causes of conflict and the promotion of durablepeace and sustainable development in Africa  which isessentially a blueprint for resolving Africa?s numerousand complex woes by charting a course for peace anddevelopment.In the area of peacekeeping  Africa has already putin place the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution to resolve its own conflictson the continent. We salute the efforts of Mr. SalimAhmed Salim  Secretary-General of the OAU  in thisdirection. We urge the international community and theGeneral Assembly to support the Mechanism in order forit to function effectively and to the benefit of Africa.The spectre of international terrorism has assumed adangerous momentum of its own. It does not discriminatebetween combatants and non-combatants. The brunt of it28all is in fact borne more by innocent bystanders. The actsof terrorism that rocked our sister republics of Kenya Tanzania and South Africa  and the subsequent retaliatoryaction on Sudan and Afghanistan  have struck a cord in allof us  without exception. At issue is the unnecessary loss ofhuman life. To protect human life  the internationalcommunity should seriously address itself to the root causesof terrorism. The hour has now come for the fullimplementation of the General Assembly Declaration onMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism contained inresolution 49/60  and the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings adopted at the fifty-second session. This Assembly must waste no time in itsurgent conclusion and effective implementation of acomprehensive international convention on combatingterrorism.We are happy to note that the United NationsDiplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on theEstablishment of an International Criminal Court  whichwas held in Rome  Italy  this year  adopted the Court?sStatute. This is a powerful instrument of justice that theinternational community has given to itself and generationsto come. My delegation is pleased that the crime ofaggression falls within the jurisdiction of the Court although the Court shall only have jurisdiction over thecrime once a definition and the conditions under which theCourt shall do its work are agreed upon. In this regard  welook forward to a quick resolution of this matter  sinceresolution 3314 (XXIX) contains most of the elements fordefinition of the crime of aggression.Considering what the world has witnessed in our sisterrepublic of Rwanda and in the former Yugoslavia  wewelcome the inclusion  under war crimes  of cases of armedconflict not of an international character.Let me now  on behalf of my delegation  turn to theworld economy  which is becoming more integrated.Globalization and liberalization are indeed the currenteconomic wave  and will continue in years to come. Theyhave  however  far-reaching implications  in particular forthe developing countries  as reflected in the currentinternational financial confusion or turmoil. The UnitedNations faces the great challenge of coming up withinitiatives to manage globalization and liberalization in sucha manner that they benefit the entire community of nations without exception. Processes of globalization andliberalization that undermine development are not in theinterests of the international community.The external debt problem is yet another issue thatimpacts negatively on the economic and socialdevelopment of many developing countries  Zambiaincluded. We can recall a number of initiatives put inplace to resolve this particular problem  but so far noneseem to be effective  including the present HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative  whichnot only has targeted too few developing countries butalso has a long transition period before eligibility isgranted.It would  however  be a grave oversight to fail toacknowledge the commendable efforts of our brother  theSecretary-General  in this area. Zambia welcomes theuniform and strong endorsement by the DevelopmentAssistance Committee of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development of the Secretary-General?sproposals to liberalize and assess the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Debt Initiative and convert all remainingofficial debt owed by the poorest African countries Zambia included  into grants. We also welcome his otherproposals which received similar endorsement by theDevelopment Assistance Committee.Adverse weather patterns continue to bring intosharp focus how fragile the global environment is. Therecent destruction of life and property by HurricaneGeorges in some countries of the Caribbean and fourStates in the United States of America adds to the ravagesof flooding in China and Bangladesh this year. ThisAssembly will recall that a year earlier Europe facedsimilar flooding  while certain parts of Eastern andSouthern Africa faced a combination of flooding anddrought. All these are reminders to the internationalcommunity to meet the challenges caused by climatechange and other adverse environmental factors and wereiterate our call to the international community topromote environmental sustainability with renewedcommitment.Transnational deflationary forces are threateningglobal economic stability. In this uncertain outlook  thefortunes of many countries are under constant threat. ForAfrica  which is just emerging from the lost decade of the1980s  the emerging global economic turmoil will addnew strains to the process of promoting economic growthand development. Indeed  it is already clear that concernabout the emerging global economic turmoil neglects thechallenges facing Africa  as if to reaffirm itsmarginalization in the world economy.29In a spirit of interdependence  we in Africa call uponthe international community not to overlook and forget thechallenges of Africa. Africa needs a conducive internationalenvironment that will contribute to resolving the continent?sexternal debt crisis  growing poverty  slow export growthand other impediments to its development.In this regard  we are pleased to note that Japan willsoon be convening the Second Tokyo InternationalConference on African Development. We salute Japan. Andwe hope this forum will offer an opportunity to relaunchthe dialogue on African development.Zambia  like many other developing countries  hasbeen implementing a very painful structural adjustmentprogramme anchored on macroeconomic stabilization privatization and  of course  commercialization. The policieswe have undertaken have been critical to boosting andsustaining economic growth and development. Over the pastfew years Zambia has undergone a remarkabletransformation. We have an open economy driven by theprivate sector. In the second generation of economicreforms that we are embarking upon our major focus is onthe reduction of poverty by 50 per cent by the year 2004.We invite the international community to come and play arole in our economic programme.Let me conclude by stating that Zambia believes that as we stand on the threshold of the new millennium  we allhave a collective responsibility in this community of nationsto chart a new course to strengthen our Organization. Weneed a strong United Nations to meet the exacting demandsof the future. By strengthening it  we all strengthenourselves. Zambia pledges to be a positive partner in thisnoble endeavour.I thank the Assembly for listening to me. I thank thoserepresentatives — most of those present — who noddedtheir heads in appreciation. I thank my brothers and sistersfrom the Southern African Development Community(SADC) for being with me."
"181",7658,"ZWE",53,1998,"At the outset I wouldlike to congratulate Mr. Didier Opertti on his unanimouselection to the presidency of the fifty-third session of theGeneral Assembly. His election is a well-deserved tributeto his own admirable diplomatic skills and also a vote ofconfidence in his country  Uruguay. My delegationintends to cooperate fully with him as he guides the workof this Assembly.I would like to take this opportunity to express oursincere appreciation to his predecessor  our friendHennadiy Udovenko  of the Republic of Ukraine  for theable and exemplary manner in which he presided over thework of the fifty-second session.In the same vein  we would like to pay tribute to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  whose style of workand vigorous response to the various crises that havebeset the international community we deeply appreciate.We want to reiterate our confidence in his work andcontinued support for his leadership.Following the United Nations fiftieth anniversarycelebrations  we  the Member States  reaffirmed ourcommitment to the purposes and principles of theOrganization as enshrined in the Charter and further tookon the responsibility of charting an institutional9framework and operational parameters that would enhancethe Organizationâs relevance and effectiveness in thetwenty-first century. The reform proposals made by theSecretary-General in 1997 attempted to articulate a visionof the future for a United Nations Organization that is morefocused and coherent and one that better reflects the newgeopolitical realities of the post-cold-war era.We are encouraged that the first phase of the reformof the United Nations system was launched when theSecretary-General began to implement those measures thatfall within his sphere of competence as chief administrativeofficer of our Organization. My Government has taken fullcognizance of those measures  as well as of proposals forreform  and is carefully considering them in detail.The proposal to convene a Millennium Assembly toarticulate a vision for the United Nations in the new centuryhas our full support. All Member States must activelyparticipate in the preparations for and holding of theMillennium Assembly in order to come up with aconsensus document to guide the Organization into the nextcentury. However  we believe that the proposed sunsetprovisions  which are to effect cut-off mechanisms for someissues on the United Nations agenda  need to be carefullyconsidered. My Government will lend its support to anydevelopment dividend that channels savings generated byadministrative efficiency into a Development Account especially if it benefits developing countries. We mustcontinue to search for a general agreement on the properand efficient utilization of the Development Account.When the reform process was first initiated  myGovernment alluded to the need for us  the Member States to formulate a mechanism to deal with the financial crisis which  much to our chagrin  continues to worsen. I reiterateonce again that it is we  the Member States  who have topay our dues promptly  in full and unconditionally or riskbeing an ineffective Organization that is incapable ofmeeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.Still on the process of reform  my Government isdisappointed by the excruciatingly slow progress beingmade in the Open-ended Working Group on the Questionof Equitable Representation on and Increase in theMembership of the Security Council and Other MattersRelated to the Security Council. The key issue of theexpansion still preoccupies the Working Group and asolution continues to elude that Group. Africa  for its part remains steadfast in its just demand for two permanentseats â€” to be shared on a rotational basis â€” as well as forthree non-permanent seats. The system of rotation is aninnovation that Africa is proposing in the name ofdemocracy and sovereign equality of Member States. Itmay not suit other regions  and we have stated that weare preparing it for the Africa region alone. I take thisopportunity once more to urge our friends outside theAfrica region to support our just demand  as it is intendedto enhance the representative nature and authority of theSecurity Council.It has also become apparent that the impasse in thedeliberations of the Working Group is a result of thenonacceptance by a handful of powerful countries of thesacrosanct principles of equitable representation democracy and transparency. We hold that thedemocratization of the United Nations system is integralto its continued legitimacy and efficacy. Conversely  theincreasing inefficiencies and lack of efficacy that wewitness today on the part of the Security Council are inlarge measure the consequence of its lack of moralauthority  itself the result of the unrepresentative andundemocratic nature of the Council as it is presentlyconstituted.In the name of human rights  pressure has beenbrought to bear especially on developing countries todemocratize their national political systems and to becomemore transparent  and most of them have done so. Wetherefore insist that the same processes of democratizationand transparency should characterize internationalrelations  particularly the reform of the United Nationssystem.Let me recall that the Movement of Non-AlignedCountries has on several occasions spoken against theanachronistic and undemocratic nature of the power of theveto. The Movement has proposed the restriction of thescope of the veto to matters pertaining to Chapter VII ofthe Charter  with a view to its eventual abolition. Butwhile the veto exists we insist that all new permanentmembers should  in accordance with the principle ofsovereign equality of Member States  equally wield thepower of the veto.Africa has witnessed a dramatic broadening ofrelative peace and stability with the return of democracyto Liberia and Sierra Leone. The return of the legitimateGovernment of Sierra Leone is of particular significanceto the African continent  as it came about as a result ofresolute action by the Economic Community of WestAfrican States to reverse the military coup in that country.This was in conformity with an Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) watershed resolution taken at the Harare10summit in 1997 in response to the coup in Sierra Leone tothe effect that henceforth Africa will not accept the changeof a legitimate Government on the continent by militarymeans.Another example of the positive political developmentsin Africa has been the various steps taken by the presentGovernment of Nigeria to return that key country todemocratic governance. It is only fair that those who havebeen critical of events in that country in the past shouldnow openly welcome the recent positive developments.But the situation in Africa has not been without itsdisappointments. The deteriorating situation in Angoladeserves our urgent attention. The achievement of peaceand stability in that country continues to be obstructed byUNITAâs constant and deliberate non-compliance with theimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol or with relevantresolutions of the United Nations Security Council. Weurge the UNITA leadership to heed to the voice of reasonand give peace a chance in Angola. We equally urge thosemembers of the international community who haveinfluence on the UNITA leader to persuade him. In themeantime  we ask the international community to joinAngola and the countries of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) in their decision to workwith those positive elements in UNITA who havecommitted themselves to continue with the peace process inAngola.Sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence ofStates are age-old principles of international law  andrespect for them is the bedrock of inter-State relations.These fundamental principles are at the core of the UnitedNations Charter  to which we all subscribe. They are heldequally sacrosanct in the Non-Aligned Movement  the OAUand many other international organizations. Therefore anyviolation of these principles cannot and must not be takenlightly  as it poses a serious threat to international peaceand security.Sadly  in our subregion  the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo has recently fallen victim to such flagrantviolations of international law. In August this year  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo found itself under siegeby rebels supported by foreign troops. Realizing that thefall of Kinshasa was imminent  the legitimate Governmentof the Democratic Republic of the Congo  in accordancewith Article 51 of the United Nations Charter  appealed forassistance from Southern African Development Community(SADC) member States to enable it to defend itssovereignty and territorial integrity.The presence in the Democratic Republic of theCongo of allied forces from the SADC States of Angola Namibia and Zimbabwe is a response to this call and hasthe objective of upholding the fundamental provisions ofthe Charters of the United Nations and of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) on the inviolabilityof the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independenceof member States. It is also in line with the OAUresolution approved at the Harare summit of 1997condemning the change of legitimate Governments bymilitary means  as well as in compliance with a 1995resolution of the SADC Inter-State Defence and SecurityCommittee in which SADC member States agreed to takecollective action in cases of attempted coups to removelegitimate Governments by military means in thesubregion. It is in conformity with that very decisiontaken by SADC that  as I speak  troops from the Republicof South Africa and the Republic of Botswana  twoSADC countries  are involved in upholding the authorityof the legal Government of Lesotho against armymutineers.My country remains committed to the search for anegotiated settlement to the crisis in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo in accordance with the relevantprovisions of the Charters of the United Nations  theOAU and of SADC. It will be recalled that since theoutbreak of the conflict  Zimbabwe has hosted twosummits with a view to finding durable peace andstability in the Great Lakes region. The second VictoriaFalls summit  held from 7 to 8 September 1998  calledfor a ceasefire in the conflict in the Democratic Republicof the Congo. Zimbabwe remains committed to thisprocess. We appeal to the international community tosupport Africaâs various initiatives aimed at establishingdurable peace in the Great Lakes region.My country is concerned about the situation in theHorn of Africa  where fraternal forces of the FederalDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia and Eritrea are facingeach other  ready to go to war. We appeal to thesebrotherly countries to continue cooperating with the OAUin the search for a peaceful resolution to the borderconflict. In Western Sahara  we urge the parties tocomplete the Houston accords peace process by holdingthe proposed referendum.We condemn the recent killings of innocent peoplein the bombings of the American embassies in Nairobiand Dar-es-Salaam. We are disappointed by the stalematein the Middle East peace process. We urge theGovernment of Israel to show flexibility in carrying11forward the peace process. The killing of Iranian diplomatsin Afghanistan is regrettable and unacceptable in inter-Staterelations. We urge the parties to the Lockerbie affair toseize the present opportunity to resolve this sad  long-standing issue. We ask for good faith on all sides in orderto carry the process forward.The African continent continues to face a multitude ofproblems as it settles into the new world order. Africancountries are implementing painful political  social andeconomic adjustments to existing structures in order torespond to the twin processes of liberalization andglobalization. We have embarked on structural adjustmentprogrammes  often at the behest of the Bretton Woodsinstitutions. These programmes have had a severely adverseimpact on the social welfare of the African countries. Thecurtailment of expenditure on social programmes particularly health and educational facilities  in the absenceof the requisite safety nets  has worsened the livingconditions of the majority of the African peoples and insome cases this has heightened instability and insecurity inour countries.For many developing countries  the issue of resourceflows cannot be dissociated from that of the external debtproblem. Figures continue to indicate that the overall debtof developing countries is still on the increase. We believethat new  comprehensive and coordinated approaches to thedebt and debt-servicing problem have to be adopted including outright forgiveness.The critical economic situation in Africa  the leastdeveloped and most marginalized of all regions  has to beaddressed if global economic growth and interdependenceare to have any meaning at all. Apart from the excruciatingand debilitating debt  there is need for an increased flow ofresources in the form of both official developmentassistance and foreign direct investment.I wish to conclude my remarks on economic mattersby mentioning an issue that is of vital importance to thequestion of sustainable development: the World SolarProgramme 1996-2005  which was adopted by the WorldSolar Commission. The promotion and popularization ofsolar energy technologies can be a major contribution tosolving the worldâs energy crisis and ensuring theavailability of a clean and inexhaustible source of energyfor sustainable development. I urge all Member States tosupport the draft resolution on the World Solar Programme which will be presented at this session.In the field of disarmament  the much vaunted peacedividend did not materialize at the end of the cold war.On the contrary  it appears that an arms race is still withus  and it is my Governmentâs strong conviction that theinternational community must continue to workpurposefully for nuclear disarmament  as well as for thetotal removal from the face of our planet of otherweapons of mass destruction and for stricter control overthe production  sale and movement of small arms. Mydelegation was deeply disappointed that the UnitedNations Disarmament Commission this year concluded itssubstantive session without reaching an agreement on theneed for  or the agenda of  the fourth special session ofthe General Assembly devoted to disarmament. We oweit to posterity to lay the foundations of a third millenniumfree from nuclear weapons and other weapons of massdestruction.My Government welcomes the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings adopted at the fifty-second session of the GeneralAssembly  and the recently adopted Statute of theproposed International Criminal Court. The internationalcommunity has long witnessed how ill-equipped MemberStates of the United Nations have been in dealing withinternational terrorism  and for us in Africa the recentterrorist bombings of the United States embassies inNairobi and Dar-es-Salaam  which together claimed about260 lives  brought home to us the vulnerability ofdeveloping countries to the sophistication of modernterrorism.The Statute of the International Criminal Court hasforged the missing link in the international legal order andis a genuine step forward in the field of human rightslaw. It has created new inter-State relationships andcomplementarity between national and international law.As we come to the close of the Decade of InternationalLaw  in 1999  we hope that the United Nations  especiallythe Security Council  will also take decisions that willresult in the advancement of the primacy of the rule oflaw in international relations in the next century.In conclusion  my delegation wishes to make a briefcomment on the contemporary realities of theinternational situation. Our balance sheet leaves much tobe desired. On the credit side  we have seen a modestmeasure of success. We have witnessed a return todemocracy and peace in some countries where once therewas military despotism and armed conflict. We havesuccessfully paved the way for the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court and forged new partnerships12between our regional organizations and the United Nations.Yet we still have a daunting debit side. Conflicts still ragein many parts of the world. Poverty  inequality andunderdevelopment still remain the order of the day for 90per cent of the worldâs population. The AIDS pandemicthreatens to reverse the socio-economic gains made in mostof our countries over the years. The ongoing financial crisiswhich engulfed South-East Asia and now threatens theentire world reminds us that current efforts at a newarchitecture both for controlling the free flow of money andushering in a new discipline in the financial institutionsshould be brought about without delay. We have toconfront and reduce world poverty with determination at atime when some within the Organization itself are stillresisting the democratic changes that are necessary forenhancing the image and authority of the Organization andmaking it effective in addressing these problems. Zimbabwebelieves that the time for change is here and now and thatMember States have a moral obligation to muster thepolitical will to make those changes.Let the fifty-third session of the General Assembly beone of qualitative and meaningful change for the people ofthe world."
